Incredibly moving and tells a real story...
To be honest, anyone not moved by the story Failan tries to tell is either incredibly insensitive or too dumb to understand it. Seldom has a movie gripped me like this one has. The story, about two protagonists who live on the fringes of society, does start slowly, but comes together in the most beautiful way during the second half of the film, all the while saying some truly interesting things about - amongst others - immigration, love and redemption. The main actors are incredible in their performances and the music, photography and cinematography are also excellent throughout the whole film.A movie I'm not afraid of recommending to everyone.
