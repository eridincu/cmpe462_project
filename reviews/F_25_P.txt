Baltimore tourist board promotional video with romantic comedy
In "Hitch" Will Smith played a date doctor bringing couples together, whereas in this film Sarah Jessica Parker pushes families apart, helping to kick 30 somethings out of the nest.Michael McConaughey is a 35 year old boat broker who still lives with his parents (he's actually 37). So SJP is called in as he is having failure to launch to help him on his way.It's a cross between "How to lose a Guy in 10 Days" and "Point Break" (or at least a Baltimore tourist board promotional video). As Michael and his two buddies Justin "National Treasure" Bartha and Bradley "My little Eye" Cooper (who also live with their parents) go biking, paint balling, sailing, rock climbing and even swimming with dolphins.But instead of Kate Hudson "How to lose" we get SJP, that's my biggest problem with the film, she is miscast at 41 years old she is looking too old for the part. Michael is great as the lovable rogue but I couldn't why he would go after SJP who is looking like a leathery blonde with a big chin when the lovely and kooky Zooey ("Almost Famous", "Hitchhikers Guide") Deschanel is her room mate. In fact some of the funniest scenes involve Zooey who has a bit of a drinking problem, not to mention the mocking bird my favourite subplot. The cast also includes Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as his parents.It was directed by Tom "Shanghai Noon" Dey and it's the first screenplay for TV writers Tom J.Astle and Matt Ember. It's a likable romantic comedy for guys, hence all the action sports a pity about the poster and SJP.
