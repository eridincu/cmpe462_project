Pixar has yet to top this movie.
Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.
