Another grain of sand on that great beach called cinema
"Fast Food, Fast Women" has little to do with either. A somewhat inept, light-hearted slice-of-life indie, this flick revolves around a single 30-something woman, Bella (Anna whatever-her-name-is), who waitresses in a NYC diner, and her assorted friends/acquaintenances with loneliness and the need for relationships being the central theme. A very forgettable flick, "FF,FW" is not without its moments and manages some poignancy, quirkiness, and heart. However, in the grand scheme of all things cinema, this is just another marginally entertaining film with a bunch of where-have-I-seen-him/her-before character actors which will never be more than a so-so small screen watch.
