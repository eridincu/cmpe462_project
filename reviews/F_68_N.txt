A Poor Generic Movie
This film hit Netflix today and I have now watched Fatal Affair and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman attempt to rekindle her marriage when she has an encounter with an old friend, but he can't leave her alone. Main Character Nia Long straight from the 90's is the lead here and she is fine, she does a decent job here, it is just there is nothing remarkable about her character at all. She is fine in the role, but as all of this movie is she is really bland and generic here. Supporting Characters Omar Epps plays the stalker here and again he is fine, he doesn't stand out as an amazing character but he plays the creep fine and does come across that way at some times. Also the rest of the cast are just fine but again nobody stands out at all. Story The story is so bland it is unreal, I can't believe films like this are made these days, Fatal Attraction came out so long ago and this film is just a cheap imitation of it and does nothing and I mean nothing that feels unique or interesting. Script The script here is truly awful, it does nothing to help the actors, they do okay jobs in spite of this script not because of it. There is no big dramatic moments and no sense of humour at any point and it fails miserably here. Style The style has some good moments of tension, I must admit that at times when Long's character is meant to be creeped out, I was too so it worked there. But this film is paced so slowly, even though it is under 90 minutes it felt like 2 hours to me and that really hurt the film. Overall Overall, I think this must have been one of the quickest reviews I have ever done. It is a boring generic movie and I would avoid missing it and literally do anything else for 90 minutes of your life.
