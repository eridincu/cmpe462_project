Hot Mess
This movie has no idea what it's supposed to be. A romance? A dance film? A conversion film? It's awkward at all three.This is one of the slowest and poorly written things ever filmed, and we watch every Hallmark romance that airs.I don't mind a little Jesus thrown into a film if it's well done. This is not that film. Even the dancing (the primary plot point of the movie) isn't exciting. Watched this with my mother-in-law, 83, who said at one point, "How long has this movie been one? It seems like days!"
