One of my top five all-time favorites.
This movie deals in a gripping and real way with the implications of a run away arms race and two nations at the height of Cold War tensions. As a former Air Force NCO who served during the Reagan era (82-88) I must say that I clearly could identify with the Ed Binns and Frank Overton characters. Unless you have been there, it is hard to understand men that are duty bound to commit actions which any sane person would consider madness. It is true the effects might leave something to be desired, but they are not terrible and fit within the story quite well. Also, the lack of budget keeps the effects from overwhelming both the powerful story and the incredible acting of the principals. This movie should be required viewing for any school History class when covering the Cold War.
