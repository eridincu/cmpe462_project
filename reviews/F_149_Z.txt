The Rock is awesome, but the film isn't...
'Faster', directed by George Tillman, Jr, is a routine vendetta fare, that has The Rock at his best. BUT, The writing ain't good enough here.The Rock stars as an ex-con, who sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago. He butchers each villain, but during his mission, he is faced by a hit-man and a veteran cop.'Faster' begins well, but the screenplay drags itself a bit more than it should have. For example, the entire chapter featuring the hit-man looks forced and bores in the goings-on. One wonders was this character even needed? Even that climax for the matter, is full of loopholes. Writers Tony Gayton and Joe Gayton, haven't done a swell job, while director George Tillman, Jr, has done his job right. The Rock is the life of 'Faster'. The legendary wrestler, looks each bit of the character, and delivers a performance that can truly be credited as 'memorable'. I've always been a fan of his, and he never disappoints me. He ROCKS! Among other performances, Billy Bob Thornton is average, while Carla Gugino is effective.On the whole, 'Faster' is a must watch only for those who love The Rock.
