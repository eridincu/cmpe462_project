Became bad Sci-Fi - No human could ignore Faith the entire film
Young daughter plots for her widowed dad to fall in love with dance teach Faith. So far so good. Add in the fact that Faith, religious aspect aside, is astoundingly beautiful Even before she proves to be the hottest dancer wearing unbelievable sexy dresses. Both single, great chemistry, smoldering on the dance floor and we are to suspend our belief as Jimmy fails to so much as ask her on a date for the first hour. Then, at the one hour mark Jimmy plays the role of her wannabe boyfriend, telling Faith what to say and do. As he walks away Faith utters, What about the (goodnight) kiss and selfie? As they kiss faith puts her camera away and embraces Jimmy who returns the embrace. They kiss passionately for ten seconds. Then, they agree they both want to repeat it and kiss for another 8 seconds. These were chemistry driven, loving and steamy as heck kisses. YET, the movie returns to 'friend' mode until the very last scene. So, basically we have a horrid Sci-Fi movie since Jimmy has sadly proven, via the writers of this mess, that he is not human. Faith does little better. First, she finally acts on the obvious love vibes by asking Jimmy to kiss her. Then, just as quickly she too returns to 'we're just friendly dance partners' mode. Absurd! At this point there was no point for me to watch the movie any further. Stepping back a bit I did not at all suffer through the first hour. I could not take my eyes off Peta (Faith), her incredible ultra sexy dance outfits and her near erotic dance moves. Sensational, beautiful, talented actress! NOTE: No spoiler here since we are all told by the title, jacket photo and story line that the two meet and will fall in love by the story's end.
