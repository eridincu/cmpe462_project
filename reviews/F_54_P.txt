For romantics everywhere
This movie has a very strong story, somehow its both sentimental and not at the same time. Kang-jae is a lowlife gangster who to get some money marries a Chinese immigrant who he doesn't even care to look at. Failan pays for the arrangement in order to seek out her remaining relatives after her other passes away. Even though Kang-jae don't care for her at all, she is to him forever grateful for what he has done and keeps writing him letters like a loving wife.This movie is very well done. By the end of it I shed a few tears and felt really moved by it. The devotion and hardship of Failan is very touching and the indifference of Kang-jae makes it all tragic. Tragic in a realistic way that is, not as in the TV drama variety. Also this is the movie which made me a fan of Choi Min-sik, not the little overrated 'Oldboy' in which he is cool, but too remote to make an impact. In here he is like Kitano Takeshi in his seedy gangster-don't-care fashion, but rawer and even cooler. Cynthia Chung ain't bad either, she makes a good character and is very pretty, but I couldn't stop wishing that she didn't do her nose like that. I don't get it, why surgically make a western nose when whats there from before is much more beautiful?? Asians (and others of course) everywhere, please stop the foolish surgery, people are beautiful as they are, not as they are created in a fashion image.
