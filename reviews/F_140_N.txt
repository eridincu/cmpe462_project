Trashy from beginning to end.
I kept waiting for a storyline, a plot, something other than a series of actions by a group of pretty pathetic characters. Jake Busey is fun to watch and did OK. I just wanted to slap Crispin Glover. The only way anybody could be so stupid and unaware of the real world is to live in his basement bedroom with no radio or television his entire life. And never go outside. And as an actor, wherever I see he's going to be in a movie, it always seems to be the same character. Not sure about his range as a performer. Jennifer Tilley's character was all over the place. I couldn't figure out where she as coming from. It just goes to show that even with a voice like hers, you can make it in movies. I should give all would-be actors hope. At least Busey's character knew what he wanted. Sex and beer and then sex and any other kind of liquor that was available. Seemed like someone knew that if you make a movie and throw in enough skin, boobs, drinking, drugs and weird sex there will be an audience. Unless you are pretty open minded, not recommended as a "date movie."
