Barely any plot development
I am a long time fan of the series, watching the show since its second season came out. I've watched and supported the adventures of the cast, owning the disc sets of the episodes, owning the first movie and lots of merchandise. So, imagine my happiness when they start showing the dubbed movie at a theater 3 hours away from my home. I came to that movie with hopes and ambitions. I'd seen the screenshots, I'd read some reviews of the movie, and i'd even seen that one of my favorite YouTubers, Nathan Sharp, was a voice actor. And after sitting through all of the movie, all I have to say is this: If you want an anime movie with fan-service and funny jokes, go right ahead and watch this. But if you came to watch strong, emotional, plot driven moments and character arcs, then you will be disappointed.
