Any excuse to get Kay Lenz naked ..........
James Woods plays his familiar time tested smarmy character as a cocky prison guard who is always playing the angles. Unfortunately this time he is being played. "Fast Walking" is a prison movie that revolves around two plots, one to spring a "Black" activist, and another to kill him. When Woods tries playing both ends against the middle, things don't turn out exactly as planned. The acting in "Fast Walking", especially by Woods is totally acceptable. M. Emmet Walsh is kind of wasted as another corrupt guard, while Kay Lenz is featured,constantly getting undressed. The plot is fine but the movie drags in places, and seems overlong at 115 minutes. - MERK
