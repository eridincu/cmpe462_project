One of the best movies I've seen in a long time
32 people out of 138 gave this movie an 8, 9, or 10. That means that over 23% of people who watched it and bothered to vote were smart enough and thoughtful enough to actually get it... that's not too depressing.I thought this movie was awesome. I couldn't stop thinking about the psychology of the characters and how much thought must have gone into writing this. Natasha Lyonne's and Adam Goldberg's characters are boring and "normal" characters, whereas Crispin Glover(Jules), Jake Busey(Rick), and Jennifer Tilly(Ginger) are caricatures of three different types of people. Rick is completely driven by hormones and impulses, Jules lives in his head and observes the world but doesn't really live in it, and Ginger is addicted to attention and mental abuse. Their attempts to live life this way eventually fails for each of them.
