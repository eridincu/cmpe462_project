This movie was a joke on all of us, right?
If you told me the writer(s) and director had just come to this planet and had never seen a movie or even read a book before, it still wouldn't completely excuse just how god-awful this movie was.I'm not going to delve into the hows and whys of what made this movie so terrible because frankly I don't want to relive this picture. Just suffice it to say that yes, my wife and I did finish the movie. In the same way that you wouldn't turn away from a plane crash. But we both spent a majority of the time mouths agape or laughing out loud at something they didn't intend to be funny.SPOILER ALERT *******In the closing minutes, when McConaughey fell into the ocean, I made a prediction out loud that went like this:"OK, let me guess ... a female dolphin, wearing lipstick, is going to swim up to McConaughey and instantly fall in love with him and start trying to hump him because let's face it, McConaughey is the most humpable thing in the universe (I said in a snarky way.)And then .... McConaughey will yell in a panic to Sarah Jessica Parker "if you're gonna do something, do it faaAaaaaast! This fish looks horny!" Then a Screaming Sarah will throw a life-preserver, hit Matthew in the head, knock him out and have to dive in herself to save him. Meanwhile the boat drifts off into the sunset without them so a pod of adoring dolphins carries our two nitwits ashore with baby dolphins leading the way, throwing rose pedals."OK, so I got the lipstick part wrong. And it didn't go quite as wacky as I predicted. But I got close enough that my Wife was like OH MY GOD - HOW could you possibly know that?!"I told her I tried to think of the most asinine, ridiculous, wacky, cheesy, fifth grade, horrible idea I felt that Hollywood could possibly conjure up - then doubled it. That's how bad this movie is.In closing : we should all slap a class-action suit on everyone involved with this picture and force them out of entertainment forever.
