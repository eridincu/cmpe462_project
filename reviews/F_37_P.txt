Venessa Kirby is gorgeous and so worth seeing along with the other goofballs
Action filled and perfect summer banter movie! Definitely one of the best Fast and Furious adaptations since the first 2 films, David Leitch is an incredible director and I love his style! I'm shocked their was only 1 other person the theater and he didn't even stay for the ending. I laughed a lot too; also it was in IMAX which is always great! I definitely would recommend this to anyone a fan of the series or not, it's still very entertaining.Edit since this review is doing so well my name is Alex Nolan and I'd like to become very well known like Roger Ebert!!
