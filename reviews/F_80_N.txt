Fatally flawed
**SPOILERS**I hardly ever review movies, but this one was so terrible I had to. I wanted to like it. I've been waiting to watch since Nia Long promoted it on The Breakfast Club a few months ago. It's one of her first turns as a producer and I really wanted to support her, but this movie is trash. First off, the entire thing is rushed. So you run into an old college friend, have a hot and heavy night and within a few days he's gone completely off the rails stalker bonkers? Then Long's character just goes down a path of bad decision after bad decision until you wonder how this woman ever managed to finish law school and work for a high powered firm when she keeps making the most asinine choices. So many plot holes, a hacker's computer is cracked in 2 attempts, random bodies popping up and the list goes on. The only redeeming moment is being able to laugh at the end and say "You got the Juice now" (fans of Omar Epps' debut will get that). So so so bad.
