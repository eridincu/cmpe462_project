FEAST is finally served, but I didn't have an appetite.
I sat through the whole project Greenlight of Feast and found it entertaining. The entire process of making a film is a tedious and mind cracking task. You could see the stress dripping across John Gulagers face during the entire process so I definitely feel for him. Well, it's been a year later and FEAST finally was released on DVD and I ran out and purchased it. As I sat in my living-room watching the film excitement quickly turned to confusion. The film has a good look, but once the action scenes begin thats when the confusion set in for me. The quality of the film took on a digital look. Especially when the blood started flying. I don't know what it is, but it had a bad strobe like effect. You couldn't tell what the heck was going on. Other then this, FEAST is nothing new. Fans of the genre have seen it all before. I know it was John's first attempt and he was under a huge amount of stress. But even with these facts I'm sorry to say, I enjoyed the making of FEAST more then the final product.
