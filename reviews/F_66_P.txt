beautifully painful
This was so heartrending I never want to watch it again, however Im thankful to have watched it. It's beautiful in a way that breaks you.Failan is the sweetness that is this movie, and Kangjae is the helpless violence. Together this makes for a very touching movie. I watched it a few months ago but I still feel sad inside about it when I think about the story.I stupidly came in thinking it would be a story where the woman changes the mans life for the better. The synopsis was a bit misleading for me, I think that's what made it even sadder. She does change him however. Its amazing how so little has such an impact, when they never met. This isn't your typical romance. There are brutal things so faint of heart I would advise to be wary. However its worth the pain, because its so beautiful.
