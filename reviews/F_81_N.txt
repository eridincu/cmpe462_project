Disappointed
I am so furious that we have two tiered talented actors in this movie and this is what we get. I am sure the actors knew it was a flop when filming. I just wish they could've been vocal about making this movie suspenseful. It was the same old type of fatal attraction movie but with no action.If you need a sleeping pill, this movie will cure your insomnia.
