Not even worth watching in a quarantine
Okay, let's start with the good, shall we?I gave this movie 2 stars. 1 star for the scenery. The house on the beach was gorgeous. The other star is because the movie was only 1:29. Thank the Lord.Now...the bad (and there's a lot of bad, but I'll make it quick).Script: typical, predictable and cringeworthy.Acting: soooooo bad. I love Nia and Omar but this was a waste of their talent. And the daughter. Sheesh.Background music: will someone please kill the Lifetime movie music in the background! Ugh.Plot: What the...? So you meet this guy from college, 20 years go by and you go out with him for drinks and he just happens to be crazy? You're a lawyer; you couldn't pick up on the vibes that he was flirting with you at the office before you asked him to join you and your girlfriend for drinks? Lonely in your marriage or not Sis, you should have caught that right away.Of course he seduces the best friend after Ellie says scram because she loves her husband. The BFF is clueless because she believes this random guy over her friend for years (eye roll). Crazy dude David snaps and puts BFF in the hospital because he wants Ellie and only Ellie (eye roll). Ellie investigates crazy David, sneaks in his apartment (eye roll) and finds out just how crazy he is because he's been following her and he killed his ex wife. Crazy David pretends to commit suicide (eye roll). Everything is finally perfect, but wait...! He's alive, tricks Ellie to go to her office to sign some paperwork (at night mind you and she goes by herself - eye roll).Crazy David kills Ellie's assistant, breaks in Ellie's home, kills the daughter's boyfriend, plays 'Forget Me Not' to make the scene suspenseful and scary for us the viewers (doesn't work because you know what's coming - eye roll). He ties up the husband and daughter, kills the cop that shows up (um...you guessed it, eye roll).Crazy David is crazy and in invincible because he's so darn hard to kill (he gets stabbed but still able to chase Ellie and her husband). But here's the most laughable part of the movie: after David tries to KILL her husband, she hold on to him trying to save him from falling off a cliff.Watch this movie only if you want a few decorating tips because the house really is beautiful.
