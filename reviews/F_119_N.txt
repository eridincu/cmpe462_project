Not an accurate picture of elite athletics
I recently came across this movie on an online movie site. As a 30 year veteran of track and field officiating in the US and with at least 35 years experience as a competitor, I thought the movie might be interesting. The plethora of errors about the sport of athletics (track and field in the US) were more than I could tolerate after watching about 30 min. The US relay squads DO NOT practice and run together for years as one British national coach asserted. That is why they fail to finish or are disqualified from so many World Championship and Olympic 4 x 100 meter relay races. The 4 x 200 meter relay is almost never run in international meets as was pictured in the film. At least one, and usually several field events are being contested in the infield during meets. That the infield was conspicuously void of athletes during the meet in Spain seemed to prove that the movie had a very small budget and couldn't afford actors to portray jumpers, vaulters, and throwers, or the writer(s) knew next to nothing about the sport. I won't even try to go into the plot and acting shortcomings.
