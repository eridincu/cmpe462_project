Not too shabby for a beginner, don't you think?
AN AWESOME MUSEUM PIECE OF 70'S DRAG RACING "B" DRIVE-IN MOVIE HISTORY!As other reviewers have said, this is not Cronenberg's best movie, but you need to understand even though it came out in 1979, it was shot way before that, and was one of his first movies of this commercial nature, actually his first movie with a budget of over a million dollars. So? So lighten up a bit, and look at what is there, not what lacking! Yes, I agree with the blackxmas review above, but beg you all to view this as a "moment in time", in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and Spokane, Washington, USA. You have to, otherwise it won't stand up to criticism using current movie criteria. In other words, do not buy this movie if you want an intriguing plot and award-winning acting! LOL But if you know a person who went to these two drag strips back in the 70s, make their day with this one! I am not going to add any more film criticism here, but wanted to make the point that it is rare movie because of the age of this famous film maker, because few VHS copies were ever released and because it is a Northern-made drive in movie made by a young Canadian film maker. Yes, Canadian. LOL And, oh yes---- a certain November 1969 Playboy model named Claudia Jennings was featured in this movie, and tragically, and perhaps ironically, lost her life in a car accident shortly after. So, yes, I think Fatss Company is a collector's movie.**Canada had just started offering incentives to U.S. film makers to come up north, so David was in the right place at the right time. A long string of very famous movies have been shot here in Alberta, and Brad Pitt is getting ready to star in a movie about Jesse James--right here--- as I am typing this.One last thing: If you look VERY carefully in the stands near the crash scene, you may be able to see me in my Mopar ball cap----yes, I was there. Hey Honey--we're out of popcorn! See you at the movies!
