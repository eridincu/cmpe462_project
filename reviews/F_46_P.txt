An early Terminator
This is a cold war film, and several times the issue of machines taking over the decisions is mentioned. My point is, that it addresses many of the same issues, that Terminator 1 and 2 does. Many other people have written comments about this movie, I agree with most of them. This is an excellent film, still scary today.One detail worth noting is, that it is real time. When the pilot of the planes says, that there is 14 minutes to the target, then it is 14 real minutes. Many modern films cheat with this time, if you see a bomb counter getting very close to zero, then the hero always have 5 minutes anyway and stops the bomb at 00:00:01.This one is true in time - which makes it more realistic and scary - but there is no hero able to defuse the bomb.Sic transit gloria mundi (That's how the glory of the world ends).
