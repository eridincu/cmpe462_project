Scary-and I Mean SCARY-Cold War Yarn
Fine performances and excellent direction make the difference in this 1964 film set during the Cold War. A U.S. bomber with nuclear weapons is mistakenly ordered to bomb Moscow, plunging both countries' militaries and political leaders into a frantic battle against time to avert an accidental nuclear attack. Henry Fonda as the U.S. president, Larry Hagman as Buck his translator, Ed Binns as the pilot of the attack plane, Walter Matthau as an ultra-hawkish professor, along with a great supporting cast will have you on the edge of your seat during the entire film. Dom DeLuise even appears in a serious role as a computer technician.The ending is downbeat but it's quite a rollercoaster ride to arrive there, and after the film is over you'll wonder if this could really happen. Only 19 years later in 1983 it almost DID happen, as a false alarm nearly caused the exact thing that this movie depicted in fiction. Only a brave and decisive Soviet officer decided that the incoming U.S. "missile" was likely a computer error, which it was. When you think about that incident and the events shown in this movie, the scenario seems very real and very scary. The film will make you feel uneasy, but that's the whole point.
