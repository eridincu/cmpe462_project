Strange, tasteless trashy road film fun.
One problem is, you look at the cast and expect gold, I'm here to say DON'T. Enjoy it for what it is and you're going to have a good time.Fast Sofa is a strange watch. It's a movie that will leave some very cold towards it. A crazy cast delivers some very watchable moments and it's got very nuanced, strange performances from both Crispin Glover and an over the top Jake Busey. I recommend this on some conditions...The problem with this movie, it lacks direction. Even in a buddy road movie about two people with NO direction you need to have a somewhat coherent plot. This movie misses on that, no matter, it keeps you watching with cheap shock value, strange exchanges and funny moments. The film seems to be schitzo, but again that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film. The director could have reigned in the camera trickery as it plays out like a bad art student film at times but I found it tolerable. Interesting credits.While this film is hard to watch for some people as it tends to meander, Jake Busey and Crispin Glover make this is a must for fans of strange trashy late night films. I really at times wonder why Busey hasn't done more, he's got great timing and strange charisma. Ah well, put this one on your late night viewing list, keep your expectations low and enjoy. 7/10
