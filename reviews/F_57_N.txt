A bit ridiculous
Given that the title of this Italian movie spoken in English is Fast and Sexy, there's no doubt who is the leading lady: Gina Lollobrigida. You'd think with such a racy title, this would be a heavy, steamy drama, but it's actually a comedy where all she wants to do is get married!Gina stars as an Italian woman moving back to her hometown after her American husband died and left her a fortune. She wants to get married again, and as the small town buzzes with rumors, every man in town pursues her for her bankroll. She's beautiful; why aren't they pursuing her for her looks? Gina only has eyes for Dale Robertson, the one man who doesn't fall all over himself-of course. I was rooting for Vittorio De Sica, Gina's first love from her youth, but it's made clear pretty early on that the movie isn't going to go in that direction. Instead it's a silly comedy in which premarital sex is looked at as the greatest sin on earth. With the title and its choice of leading lady, that theme seems a little ridiculous. Spoiler alert: the movie is a little ridiculous. Unless you're insisting on watching every movie Gina ever made, you don't need to rent this one. Stick with Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell if you're looking for a cute Italian-set comedy.
