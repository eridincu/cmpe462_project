Professional road trip
If you are a courier, you have a certain job to do. In this case, it's a convoy as the title suggests, so it's a couple of cars transporting something illegal (otherwise it wouldn't have most of its tension of course). It seems to me that someone did their homework regarding research. Be it because they were involved personally or because they asked the right people.Still this is very bleak and while we have a lot of character moments, they are not the most likable people portrayed in film. Which makes it hard to connect for many viewers in the first place. So if the central idea does nothing for you, you may not want to watch this. Also the ending seems to try to do something dramatic that just doesn't quite work chemistry wise (in my humble opinion). Still more than decent effort and good action scenes
