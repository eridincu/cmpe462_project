Spoiled by "Killer"
The movie starts well with Johnson "The Rock" filling his normal hardnut role; just out of prison with a score to settle. This movie, however, had more of a cutting edge than a typical Rock movie...normally he roughs people up a bit, maybe breaks someones arm then calls an ambulance for them; in this movie he just pulls out a gun and blows his victims away without blinking an eye.Billy Bob Thornton plays the role of a crooked drug-addicted cop very well, and added a nice layer to the film.Then there is the "Killer"...I think this guy should have been totally cut from the movie. His whole persona (and that of his girlfriend/wife) is totally unbelievable. He's a young "model" guy with British accent living in a mansion in the dessert; he is apparently very rich, a hit man, and has overcome some kind of leg disability...oh and he has a nice picture show of his corny (Climbing Everest,etc..) "achievements" on his walls, and then he later views them as a slideshow on his computer.This movie started to go down hill as soon as "Killer" walks into his garage and starts switching out the license plate on his silver Ferrari (yeah, like it's going to be difficult for the DMV to figure out who owns the silver Ferrari with a fake license plate!) Every time this guy in on screen he is doing or saying something stupid. He charges $1 for hits because he is "challenging" himself, yet he seems to totally suck as a hit-man... If they had cut all his scenes out of the movie it might have been a 7 or 8, with him in it; it's a 4 at best.
