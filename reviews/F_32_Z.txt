Dmx
Honestly I only watched it because DMX is in it. This would be a great movie if it was on a big budget production. The storyline wasn't bad and the actors did a good job. But it badly lacked research into cars especially from the main actor. Nos at the start of a 1000 mile race by one one actor. A muscle car that clearly has a truck gear box and driving at 180mph with the windows half up while casually moving the steering wheel side to side. I feel it is a B movie and if that was the intention then its good for a b movie. I feel it's the type of movie on late at night on film4 or on scyfy with the likes of sharknado. The best part about this movie was seeing DMX look healthy I would gladly watch movies like this if it meant he was in a good space. RR
