Second chances
Failan is the first movie out of Korea I had ever seen. As I sat down to watch the film, I didn't know quite what to expect, although I have seen plenty of American melodramas and other Asian films. Simply put, I was blown away. I can't really describe why I am still so touched by this movie, but I think that is part of the beauty of it.I have had discussions with others about the film and the biggest qualm seems to be that the first half's violence doesn't quite work with the second half's intense drama. I wholeheartedly disagree. It is important that Kang-jae's development as a character comes quickly and seemingly out of nowhere. Without him being set up as such a despicable personality in the first half of the film, the power of the film completely misses. Is his transition too unbelievable? Although under false pretenses, Failan is the first and only person who has ever cared, trusted and believed in Kang-jae. Would this not change you? The film constantly beats on Kang-jae through most of the film (a role typical for Choi Min-sik), so this really sets up the tragedy at the end of the film - with Kang-jae forever unable to fulfill his second chance.
