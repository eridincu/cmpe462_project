Cute story. Good Acting. Crazy Camera Angles
The actors did the best they could with the script. They were charming and motivated me to finish the show. The curve of the story was off. I could tell they were trying to be genuine to real life but it made for a confusing movie. I guess life is confusing. But I felt we saw too much of the work in making this movie. So many weird camera close ups and background blurs and cuts. It's like I want this movie to get a do-over without the strange editing and filming choices. Still, I'm grateful anytime people aim for faith building, uplifting media.
