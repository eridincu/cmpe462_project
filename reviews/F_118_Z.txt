good cast keeps routine mystery going
Ann Sothern and Franchot Tone are a young married couple in "Fast and Furious" which also stars Allan Joslyn, Ruth Hussey, and Mary Beth Hughes. A friend hits lawyer Joel Sloane (Tone) up for a loan to finance a beauty pageant taking place at a resort and invites Sloane and wife Garda (Sothern) to come see the show. After they arrive, the boss of the operation is murdered, and Joel's friend is jailed on suspicion. It's up to Joel to stop looking at the bathing suited beauties and solve the case.This is a routine film, rather slow, with some nice humor. Tone and Sothern are a delightful couple. This is the earliest film in which I've seen Ann Sothern, whom I remember from her TV series as a child. She's gorgeous! A real knockout. She and Tone have the charm and lightness necessary for their roles; it's a shame they couldn't have had a better script.Though this is directed by Busby Berkeley, there are no flashy dance numbers but he does regale us with some neat camera work.A very pleasant film.
