A beautiful film
This film was totally unexpected. I recognized Min-sik Choi from "Shiri" when he appeared on the screen but this is no action blockbuster. Instead we get a film about a loser who comes to understand what he has lost in his life. Sounds dull? If I'd read that description, I'm not sure I would have bothered to watch it so I can only recommend you jump in feet first. The structure of the film is wonderful at giving our hearts the feeling of a love story when our heads know that it isn't possible. I found this film on a cheap VCD and, as far as I know, that seems to be the only way to get to see it in England. Even though this film is based on a story by a well-known Japanese novelist, I don't think it has even been released in Japan so word of mouth looks like the only way this will find an audience. If you can't find it, I'll lend you my copy!
