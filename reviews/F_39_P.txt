Amazing and chilling
Just rented this recently and was blown away! Great movie from the 60's that is still thrilling today. All the actors are superb and the tension keeps building until the end. How did I miss this before? Henry Fonda is especially good as the president who is faced with a monumental and terrible decision. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Emotional story with a chilling ending. An important message about humanity and the potential for self-destruction. Although more than 40 years old still relevant today. I hope the director received highest award for this film.A masterpiece.
