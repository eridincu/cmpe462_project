Love never realized
Failan will move you not because of its characters, but because of the film's resonance within ourselves. All too often, many of us wonder about a different path we could've taken or a choice made that was poor in hindsight. These situations comprise intimate relationships as well, where words said and actions not acted upon can have far reaching consequences. But, this is life; sometimes the most mundane decision will alter your existence, creating the potential for selfishness and kindness to go hand in hand with each other. Watch Failan and realize what I've said above is just to prepare you for a great film about what it means to be human.
