Nothing new
Shame on Netflix for delivering such a clich√©d film. This storyline has been done so many times, to be honest I don't know why I even bothered to watch it. I guess I was hoping they'd bring something new to this....alas they did not. We need originality, not done to death storylines. Every Lifetime movie has this story. Give it a miss.
