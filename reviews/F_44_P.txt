Brilliant Reresentation of what can go wrong when we depend on technology
During the cold war years (1960-1990) There were three excellent films which demonstrated what could go wrong and trigger a nuclear war by accident beyond human control. The first of these was a tense blank and white chiller called Fail Safe, taken from the Air Force's Go/No Go point beyond which bombers would be launched to attack Russia. The film stars an excellent cast led by Dan O'Herlihy as a General of the Air Force who warns that we need to step back and examine what we have created. Walter Matthau is a political scientist who argues that we should strike first as a prevention of future wars. Henry Fonda is the President of the United States who must come up with a solution when the unthinkable happens and an equipment malfunction sends bombers to bomb Moscow. Riviting suspense!
