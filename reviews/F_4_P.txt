Not at all like the trailer
The trailer was boring and I was sure I didn't want to see the movie. I am also not a big fan of Matt or Sarah. Luckily for me there was nothing "good" to see for date night out with the wife. So we decided to see "Failure to Launch". It was possibly the funniest movie so far this year. Great characters, great story, and loads of bust out laughing situations. Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates are crazy/funny and actually parents I would love to have. The rest of the cast, especially the character of Kit, are perfect for the parts played and extremely funny. This is just what it is supposed to be, a fun romp. Enjoy this movie and don't take it seriously like the guy from Canada.
