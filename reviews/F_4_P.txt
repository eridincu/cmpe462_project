Definitely worth a watch
If you're looking for a different movie, this is definitely one to look into. I watched this one on YouTube movies, so you can watch it there if they still have it. The characters are bizarre, the plot is bizarre, and it ends pretty bizarre. There was more than one "What the..?" moment throughout. There is plenty of gratuitous sexuality and drug use as well as some genuinely funny moments. This movie made me laugh out loud more than once, which I thought was unique because it was not listed as a comedy and was funnier than some movies that claim that title. There seemed to be a good level of character development, and even though Rick seems like a drug head porn addict, he is clearly compassionate with his newfound friend, who is passionate about birds (as his father has built a bird store, and now new owners have it), and regrets accidentally killing a bird as a child, and he never quite got over it. The little showdown in the bird store brought the characters around full circle, as Rick sides with his friend about the mistreatment of a hawk. The ending is sad and in a way ambiguous. Rick and his friend are thrown from the car in an accident, and the full closing of one body bag means he didn't make it. Rick's bag however remains open, with a quick shot at the end of the zipper being pulled up, but it's so quick I wasn't sure if he had lived or died. It made me feel weird, much like an unresolved problem in life that I can't fathom out, I can't change. The movie is over, there is no more. I quickly recapped and remembered how many emotions are tied up in this film. It is weird, funny, tragic, erotic, sad. It was over too quick. Then I sat back, thought about it for another second and thought, "That WAS a GOOD movie."
