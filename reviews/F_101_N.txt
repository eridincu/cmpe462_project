I can't even
This was the biggest disappointment in film industry whether it's anime or other types of films. And this is coming from a fan who liked the other Fairy Tail films. I just don't understand how this was allowed to be made. I'm not trying to be rude but why would you so obviously cut scenes out and expect the viewer to just figure out how the character suddenly changed location or fill in the gaps? And how can you make basically the boss battle 1 min 30 secs?? This is beyond anti climatic. It just makes their motivation to win rushed and cringy. I have such a long list of amateurish flaws that I don't even know what to say next so I'm just going to stop here and warn anyone that is looking forward to watch this film: Don't. Stick to the manga.
