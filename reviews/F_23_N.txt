Worst Movie 2006
This movie is, TRULY, worse than a parking lot full of whale vomit. I didn't care about any of the characters and just wanted it to end before having to endure any more feelings of embarrassment at how ridiculous this film was. The story is simple: A man in his 30's still lives with his parents and, although he has a good job, he actually wants to live with his parents due to problems he has with relationships. His parents want him out and they hire a woman who specializes in getting older men to leave their parents' homes. So the girl comes to the guy and... WHO CARES! This movie is not worth anyones time and will--Guaranteed-- leave you with time and money that you will never be able to get back and you will regret it. There should be a good, old fashioned DVD burning on all copies of "Failure To Launch". Actually, we need to take all DVD copies of "Failure To Launch" and put them in a giant Microwave oven just to be sure they could never be used again. "Failure..." is my pick for worst movie of the year (obviously).
