Stalker Fomula Film
No one does stalker or fatal like Glenn Close. No one. But we've had many follow it. The Stepfather, The Boy Next Door, The Perfect Guy etc... this is just another generic movie that follows it. Very wooden acting. The usual friend that won't listen and violent past of the stalker etc. There's just no reason to make this film. But it passes the time. It's a 4/5 from me.
