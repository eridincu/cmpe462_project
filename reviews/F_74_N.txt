Absolute Garbage
The title of the Movie Fast & Fierce: Death Race. And, starring DMX. They try really hard to capitalize on the fame of the Fast & Furious Franchise, even going so far as stealing lines. They also try to bank on the Death Race Franchise.This movie, if it was a high school project done by the failing student, would be great. As a product that cost anything more than $100 to create, absolute trash.Bad acting. Conflicting character arcs. Intense emotion with no context, followed by the opposite emotion, without any reason. Terrible CGI, where you clearly see a car in front, and yet, the driver looks in the mirror to check on them. At one point, the white car was in a race to the finish line, was cut off, and cut in behind the other car, only to win the race seconds later. They skipped checkpoint 3. And, totally ignored major plot errors. There's tracking tech in the car. Without anyone following closely, and no other cars in site. Immediate back up/goons. Because of the tracking tech. It's super well hidden. Sitting in plain site in one car, on top of the visor of another. Wireless tech, which a simple button press disengaged, to stop the video feed, yet, cars still being live tracked by home base.The hardcore killers who kill police like it's nothing, in the very next scene are freaking out because, unknown reason. Told to drive to the airstrip, not seen for an entire day. Show up in the same vehicle, after crossing a border, even though it was a race to get there, and they left half a day later than the racers.Also, a 1000 mile race, sounds like a 10 hour race. Why did it take 2 days, or more.... At one point they draw attention to the fact that the lead car is going 118 miles per hour, because it's a race.Please don't waste your time watching this movie.
