A Treat From Fast And Furious Team
Hobbs and Shaw was one of those movies from the first trailer that it seems interesting and indeed it was interesting. The ratio between drama, action and comedy made for a unique Fast And Furious film that could be enjoyed by all over and over again. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham was shown once again and it made for a great film. The only thing that was not really enjoyable about this movie was that it did not really match with all the previous Fast and Furious films as there was not much car action in my opinion and I think the storyline could have been improved so that it matches the Fast and Furious story. Other than that, Hobbs and Shaw was very enjoyable and I already saw it twice but I would see it over and over again for sure.
