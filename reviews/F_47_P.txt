A treasure meant to be found: Eloquent, Subtle and Heartbreaking
'Failan' is the sophomore feature film of director Song Hae-seong, who made a big splash in 1999 with another time-twisting romance called 'Calla'. This time around, he works with acclaimed Japanese novelist Jiro Asada (reknowned for his best-selling novel 'Love Letter' which had been previously made into a memorable Japanese film in 1995).Song has created a stirring romantic tragedy of immense emotional wallop that it's not easily shaken. Executed with the same quiet subtlety seen in other recent Korean romances (such as 'Il Mare' and 'Christmas in August'), 'Failan' poignantly and convincingly illustrates the tragic missed opportunity between two ill-fated star-crossed lovers while eloquently showing what it means, and how it feels, to be in love. Despite having never met, they end up giving each other the dignity and self-respect that their lives had been missing for so long. Unfortunately, the realization of what he meant to Failan comes to Kang-jae comes too late, leading to the film's most heartbreaking scene, which is compounded by the irony of how she treasured what he quickly forgot or cast off.As the film's titular character, Cheung easily does the best work of her career. Her sympathetic turn as the quiet Failan is a marvel to watch. Two of the film's more memorable sequences: Failan using quick-thinking to avoid being sold to a strip club, and the heart-wrenching first night at her new home. It is also easy to see why Choi, as Cheung's love interest, is one of Korea's most popular actors-- despite his character's slovenly appearance and boorish behavior, Choi evokes sympathy for Kang-jae with a nuanced performance that reveals the man's insecurity and gentle spirit.This indeed goes without saying that 'Failan' is one of the best films of the year.
