Pretentious Kaka
This is a wanna-be film. It wants to be like the Coen Brothers, cutting-edge, etc, etc, etc. It just doesnt cut the mustard. It really is Grim. No one over seven will believe the plot or dialogue. It's Kaka disguised as chic. So what we have as an end result is chic kaka. Probably the worst film of that decade. Poor Jeff Goldblum; he used to be cool (Greenwich Village, anyone?); now he is just old.
