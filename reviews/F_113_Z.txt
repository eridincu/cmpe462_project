cool
I love this movie and i was talking to my uncle who played "moose" in the film said he really enjoyed it i love this! yes i thought it was very good for an Australian film because i am critical as i have seen a lot of disappointing Australian movies (excluding a few like: "Muriel's Wedding" and "The Castle") i thought it was brilliant i really like it and it was sort of a coo to see someone who i was related to in a film. Must see this really great film i can't stress it enough a real Aussie classic. i also urge you if you want to see some more good Aussie movies i recommend "The Home Song Stories" "The Castle" "Muriel's Wedding" "Boytown" "Crackerjack" those are the Aussie films that i think are the cream of the Australian film industry.
