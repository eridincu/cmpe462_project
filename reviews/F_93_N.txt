Uh.....we.....uh....race?
I don't know why but a movie with fast cars, hot women, still needs a plot and half an acting job to be qualified as a starter and a finisher, I couldn't finish this movie, I barely made it to the start of the film. I made it to the 1st check point and said, BAH!!! If you looking for fast cars and such, go watch Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift or wait for Too Fast and Too Fierce which hopefully will be better!! SEE YA AT THE STARTING LINE!!!!!
