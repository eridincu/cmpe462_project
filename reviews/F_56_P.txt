Paxton's first directorial job is a good old jab at the horror/drama
Frailty suffers somewhat towards the end of the film by confusing the story into a guessing game of which guy is which (McConaughey is a part of this not to spoil anything important), but for the bulk it's worth the time and popcorn. Paxton and his crew have concocted an often original, deep thought inducing picture with more chills than gore, which also works for the feel. Here, McConaughey starts off in an FBI man's office and tells the story of of him, his brother and his father back in 1979. His father was a good father and loved him and his brother, but one night dad (Paxton) gets visited by the angel of god or other and is commanded to "destroy the demons that possess human beings". He also brings along his two sons to assist him in his tasks of destruction much to the dismay of McConaughey's younger form (played in one of the best recent kid performances by Matt O'Leary). What is revealed in this movie caused me to think deeper than I should've, or should possibly. This tale is almost in the vein of what happened with Andrea Yates and her drowning her kids- parents will is brought upon the children by the hand of god's command (the tasks once done by Abraham and such is mentioned as well). It is difficult to classify Paxton's dad right away as a nut case cause he is shown to be sane through it, and that adds the intrigue to his character and the nightmarish reality on his kids Adam and Fenton. This is something you don't really see much in movies in general and a quick peek at the least is highly reccomended. It's not a great achievement however it's enveloping style is undeniable. A-
