So easy to Review
I would like to start by saying no. Just no. Oh my gods No! Josh Trank, I assume your name is short for 'Tranquilizer', yes? I cannot think of a single thing that can save this film. Kate Mara, you are gorgeous and a wonderful actress and I admire your work and, most importantly, I hope this willfully awful thing has not destroyed your career.So: Script = No. Direction = No. Characters = No (which is odd, because the Fantastic Four are great characters, and yet you have managed to get a 'no' with them. Remarkable!). Miles Teller = No. Josh Trank = No. Even for cereal commercials, no.Recast the original Fantastic 4 movie and reboot THAT. What you have done is bad. I'm stunned. This was worse than Batman & Superman vs Storytelling, and you can read my review on that travesty on IMDb to learn just how badly you have done!
