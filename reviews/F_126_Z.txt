A good Swedish detective mystery that falls short of being great
This Swedish detective mystery is a film which is a sequel to a 90's movie I haven't actually seen, so I can't say how this one measures up against the original. Nevertheless, what can be said with certainty is this is another Scandinavian film which falls comfortably under the Nordic noir bracket. Like other north European thrillers, this one covers some dark and disturbing territory. A Stockholm police detective is sent to a small rural community to help solve the case of a missing girl, presumed murdered. He finds his more methodical methods at odds with the style of the lead police officer assigned to the case, a man who happens to be married to his widowed sister-in-law and who is now the father to his nephew.This is another solid bit of Nordic noir, yet I would classify it as a lesser example of the sub-genre. While it is undoubtedly a compelling enough crime story, the resolution to the mystery isn't perhaps very surprising and revealed quite early at that. This is compounded further by the film being a little overlong at two hours plus, given its quite basic and relatively straightforward narrative, while the final confrontation sequence was a bit too much in standard thriller territory and felt like a bit of a let-down for me. I did think the acting was very good though and the sense of place a strong point typical for these types of features. I could just have done with a little more meat to the mystery. Still, my criticisms are still only relative to the generally high quality of recent Scandinavian crime films overall, as this remains a pretty solid mystery-thriller nevertheless. Aside from the crime story, there are family and city versus small town complications added to the mix and which do expand the drama. Overall, I would classify this as a good film as opposed to being a great one though.
