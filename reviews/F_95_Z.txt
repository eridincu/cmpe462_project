The last of the series is the best.
Replaced yet again, the mystery solving married couple are now being played by Franchot Tone and Ann Southern. Reminding me a lot of Gene Raymond, Sothern's often partner in a series of RKO comedies, Tone is more amusing than Robert Montgomery, while in spots, Southern seems to be emulating Rosalind Russell in an attempt to keep the character consistent. In this entry, they are out of town where Tone is a beauty pageant judge, and of course, there is a murder to interrupt the festivities. Tone overhears an argument between two women over the same man, so when that man is murdered, both of them are at the top of his suspect list. Dander follows, culminating in a scene under a stage where Southern and Tone deal with the stage descending and threatening to crush them. Allyn Joslyn plays a reporter friend of theirs who is also a suspect, while Ruth Hussey plays a particularly ill-tempered female. Faster moving than the other two "Fast" entries, this is the one that I will most likely watch again and recommend to others, even if it still has that element of predictability and nothing new in the many "Thin Man" rip-offs, of which there were many.
