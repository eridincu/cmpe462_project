My fav of the series
This movie had in from first moment, I loved the start of Second movie but the start this incredible. The effect in that scenes were mind blowing and some very intense moment and already had me on the edge of seat Brian O'Conner, now working for the FBI in LA, teams up with Dominic Toretto to bring down a heroin importer by infiltrating his operation, While Dominic not in nice place as His girlfriends died in a race Someone was blame and it will hurt get rid of anyone that gets in is way and he is also on run from the police well. I found this one ever more enjoyable then first 2 in the movie, I did skip 3rd one as I going watch that after number Fast 6 or 7 , it won't be soon lol The way they ending the movie, WFT , NOO!, Don't end there! 8 out of 10 great movie
