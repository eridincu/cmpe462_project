Lots of bosoms, not much sense.
This is absolutely meaningless and artistically worthless, but if it hits you in the right mood you may actually enjoy it. There is an improvisatory feel to it - how else can you explain the tons of bad dialogue and the cheerfully incoherent script ? Russ Meyer was probably one of the first - and few - filmmakers to deal explicitly with the link between sex and violence and to reverse the roles of the standard action movies, but technically his film is too cheap and amateurish - apart from a really gripping final fight scene.
