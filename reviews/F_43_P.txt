One of the very best movies ever made.
I just bought a copy of this movie after hemming and hawing for several years. I have both read the book and seen the film several times.This is without a doubt one of the very best motion pictures ever made. The cast is exceptional and features actors that went on to be type cast as either comic or hack, Dom De-louis, Walter Matthau, Larry Hagman, in some unbelievably well done dramatic parts.Along with Henry Fonda as the most realistic president ever put to film, The entire cast is magnificent.Just as an aside try getting both this film and Kubricks Dr. Strangelove and watch the both. Fail Safe first the Strange Love and enjoy the juxtaposition. Basically the same story, but with a wildly divergent take on the situation.Get some popcorn and enjoy.Btw: 1. FAIL SAFE is a very intense film. watch it early in the evening.2. Dr Strangelove is a comic masterpiece but pails in comparison.3. Read the book of FAIL SAFE as well. It will chill your soul.
