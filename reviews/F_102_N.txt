Very disappointing
It's completely a film for kid. Been a Fairy Tail reader for a few years so I bothered to actually watch this movie in theatre but I regret to say I am very much disappointed after watching this movie. The whole story is just too simple and naive. It's a shame that this shitty movie was written by the author Hiro Mashima himself. Expected more of it.
