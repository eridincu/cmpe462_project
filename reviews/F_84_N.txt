A very bad affair for Netflix
Of course its better to work as an actor than to be unemployed.. But this movie is really bad.It sucks. Theres a lot of great and very good movies in this genre out there.. Well, they could do a comedy of this movie..Every scenes have a potential to do a hilarous comedy..
