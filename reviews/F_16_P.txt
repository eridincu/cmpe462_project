COLORFUL VIEWING
What we have here is good story-telling. It is as simple as that. Add people who possess powers, hidden secrets, and the lure of what those powers are and what they can do. The movie may cause you to ask what would you do with these powers? Before you boast a perfect answer everything comes with a hitch in life. So you may use these powers but at what cost? Will others just stand still while they watch you do what you do? The old "what's in it for me" kicks in and that is why the premise of secret powers is so powerful. People with them hide them. Superman and his alternate Clark Kent is a good example as is Batman and Bruce Wayne and Spiderman with Peter Parker. Powers have a way of their own and learning to live with them and by them is not so easy. Of course you will say no problem and let me have them. Well, watch the movie then. Also pay attention to whatever is happening in this movie as it can be controlled or corrected and at some point this may dawn on you or not. There was a Twilight Zone about a boy with powers to do most anything which this story may stir up in your memory. The kid was a brat however and in the remake not so much or at least reachable. Here those with the power are still learning but hiding as they do. Interesting concept. It does entertain however
