A good time!
Being a huge SJP and Matthew fan- I of course went to see the movie. I was shocked and really pleased to see how much camera time Zooey Deschanel got. She was my favorite character in the movie- by far. I wasn't expecting that at all. Her facial expressions and deep voice were perfect for the quirky character she played. So now I am a huge fan of her's. Back to the movie. The plot was a little predictable (duh),but was truly a pleasurable one. I didn't go to the movie to be deeply moved- but I did go to see a great light-hearted film with an amazing cast. And I had success. I love Kathy Bates- so it's a plus that she's in it. Terry Bradshaw is naked at one point.....so rate that as you will. But all in all- a good time was had. Go see it.
