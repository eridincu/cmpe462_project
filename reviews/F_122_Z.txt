Finding This Gem Is Serendipidy
I was on-line earlier and started thinking of those fairy tales books from school. They were the 1st books you READ after clearing flash-cards. Anyway, having lots if 'search' words I went on Google. 3rd entry was this film Fairy Tales. Briefly, I saw what it was about, sniggered then decided to write this review. PS If you have seen this film & recommend it, let me know.Thanks.
