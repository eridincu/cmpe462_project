One of the best Asian movies
This has got to be one of the most breathtaking and emotional movies to come out of Asia ever.I am not one who usually gets all emotional and mushy about movies, but this one hit the spot. The story is amazingly touching and you really get to feel with the two lead roles, portrayed by Min-sik Choi and Cecilia Cheung.It is particularly refreshing to see Cecilia in a more serious role, compared to most of the dripple that is spewed out of the Hong Kong cinema. Don't get me wrong, Hong Kong movies are nice, but they just have that whole 'not-so-serious' feel to them most of the time.I believe this movie have brought tears to the eyes of many of the viewers, and by rightly so. It is really a good movie, and one that any movie enthusiast should see at least once. I have seen it a couple of times and it doesn't get old.Get some tissue, sit back comfortably and get immersed into the story of Failan. It will move you, I guarantee.
