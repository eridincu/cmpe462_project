Well-made, but with a truly ludicrous ending
This movie made me really quite angry. Technically, it's well done and it has some scenes that will have you at the edge of your seats. But who the hell financed its making? The "United States Christian Serial Killer Association"?? The movie seems to be saying that guys who kill a lot of people, claiming that God told them to do it- are probably right! They know things you and I don't. Hello?? What kind of message is THAT? That the brother showing up at the office of the Powers Boothe character turns out to be the younger brother who naively went along with the lunacy of his father from the beginning was a nice plot twist, but what follows as soon as they reach the notorious rose garden is an insult to the audience. Even if you're a Christian -which I am not- there can't be any justification for the message this movie's ending is sending, what with "Thou shalt not kill" and all...these self-styled demon-killers would roast in hell.
