Fast, Furious and MORONIC!!!
I cannot think of a dumber film...just cannot! This film's plot, direction and acting are an insult to one's intelligence. I am all for action films, love them, but only if they can suspend my disbelief, in other words, take me into the film, get me involved, make me care about the characters and know everything I see is amazing but still possible.This piece of cinematic and dramatic garbage had people in the audience laughing, not with the movie, but LAUGHING AT IT! Laughing at the awful dialogue and the corny, clapped out scenarios and character types, and groaning at the drivel that tried to pass itself off as classy entertainment.Mabe the experts are right after all; the youth of today are getting dumber, maybe due to preoccupation with computer games...If all you want is; violence, devoid of realism and blood, car crashes and 'gee they missed them again with that shotgun at close range' then this is the film for you! WARNING: If you have a modicum of intelligence, check your brain at the door, better still, go completely stonkered drunk, maybe then you will have some fun!
