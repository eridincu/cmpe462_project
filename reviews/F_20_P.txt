4.8 overall rating??? makes no sense...
look... i really don't understand you people.... nor do i understand what exactly it is you think you need to get out of a cinematic experience... this is a romantic comedy...taken within the context of this genre, i really can't see how it could have been much better...the cast was superb, the script was derivative but totally entertaining and highly amusing, the directing was very much above average... i just don't get it.... i simply can't see how a film of this type could be markedly improved upon... lighten up and try to enjoy a film for what it is...this movie will break no new ground, it will not win any awards, it will not resolve the world's pain... it is a fun, entertaining romantic ensemble comedy that will divert and amuse if you only allow it to do so... a 4.8 rating for this film is pretentious and hyper-critical...period.
