Bathing Beauties and Busby Berkeley...Wrapped in a Nick and Nora-esque Package...what is not to love?
Fast and Furious is my second favorite in the MGM "Fast" trilogy based on a novel written by Marco Page (a pseudonym for Harry Kurnitz). The three films are about a husband and wife who are rare book dealers turned detectives with witty banter reminiscent of the Thin Man's Nick and Nora. Each of the three films recast our leading couple while keeping them in the same slightly shabby office set. This film's Joel and Garda are played by Franchot Tone and Ann Southern. I have never been a big Tone fan, but surprisingly he didn't ruin the film for me...in fact he comes in as my second favorite Joel. He had wonderful and surprisingly believable chemistry with Ann Southern, who was my favorite in the role of Garda. This film may actually have the wittiest dialogue of the three films...with my favorite line being, "Sure, Suicide...shot himself in the back, threw away the gun, unlocked the door, and laid down and died" and Joel's quip to Garda "don't let anyone in without the password. And the password is (then he kisses her)". In this the third and final film, Joel and Garda find themselves trying to help yet another innocent friend who has been falsely accused of murder...although unlike the other three this storyline doesn't involve books of any kind, strangely it involves bathing beauties which our amazing and surprising director, Busby Berkeley shows off in his usual flare...including an under water scene that involves Garda biting Joel...don't worry he deserved it! Another fun and light hearted mystery that is not quite up to Nick and Nora standards...but still with a view. Did I mention the bathing beauties? Oh! And there are Lions!
