How many times will this movie be made?
Another stalking / obsession driven narcissistic psychopath wreaking havoc on an emotionally damaged woman. You've seen this movie before, the title was different and the actors were different but the movie is the exact same Lifetime movie you've seen dozens of times. I'm not sure how so many different writers can take credit for what is basically one movie "written" over and over and over again. Or why they would even want to for that matter. Having ranted that, the acting is fine. Omar Epps' David is very convincing as the loser in this predictable rehash. Nia Long's Ellie is okay as well, but did nothing for the roll that would make it stand out from all the others. What receptionist in a luxury urban high-rise apartment building would hand over a tenants key to someone walking in off the street claiming to be a friend? The one in this movie did, with a smile! Ellie did, I think, set a record for guessing someone's password. When her married name didn't unlock David's laptop she put in her maiden name and bingo, she's in. Go ahead and watch it if the one playing on Lifetime right now is one you've already seen, if not it's a crap shoot. It is sad that Netflix, in it's quest to have unlimited content, has resorted to producing Lifetime movies... smh!
