Only tuned in for Jason Alexander...
Even the premise of the film isn't that original but I wanted to give it a shot, since Jason Alexander was in it and could be a fun movie to laugh along for an hour or so.What a giant let down. I did chuckle a few times at the beginning, but gradually it turns out none of the jokes are landing, none of the characters are well established, and you find yourself not rooting for anybody in the film because nobody has a developed character.I get that the film is low budget, but the plot didn't need to be this ham-fisted and devoid of any interest whatsoever. There are better student films on a lower budget than this.
