52 years later, and this movie is still frightening in scope...
Failsafe was written and produced to make the public aware of the frightening prospect of nuclear war, and the message is still relevant.I fully expect young people to wonder why the movie is so slow moving, given that today one push of a button would likely destroy the majority of the world 15 minutes later...the answer is in the timing of the movie...This came out when bombers were the only delivery system. Missile tech was still in its infancy, with almost no "silos" existing in the mid west. The Cheyenne mountain complex hadn't even been built yet. So that makes for a very dramatic movie, at a rather slow pace.This movie requires that you use your intellect, and understand how really terrifying nuclear war can be...today, if someone were stupid enough to actually use nukes, it would be over rather quickly in comparison...Take note, Mr Trump...
