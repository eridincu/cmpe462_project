A very beautiful and moving picture
A friend of mine told me about this Korean movie. He's a rough fellow, not the soft type. But he said this is the one movie that made him cry. Mind you, I hate sappy movies too.Although this movie didn't make me cry, I can see why others have found it so moving. It tells a tragic story of a purehearted girl who is so hard to find in this modern world. But it also tells a story of another tragic character--a gangster, a commoner, the one that we all know.I also found this movie entertaining in other ways. Acting is top notch, and the story and dialogues are pretty funny too at times in its realistic ways. Some of its intense scenes have burnt permanent images into my head.If you're a Hollywood blockbuster junkie, don't bother with this movie, because you'll never get it. If you have the slightest ability to appreciate finer things, this is a must see movie. Another gem from Korea.Cheers!
