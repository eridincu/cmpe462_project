OK Movie..Not what i expected
OK Movie, I guess. The characters acting is somewhat dumb and off. The only part that interested me was the naked boob...lol. I expect this movie to be an good action racing movie, but it turn out to be a low budget film clone FnF. Why did i said low budget? Well the cars used it the movies was old school and the characters are not that popular. 87 -92 supra and 90s mr2? hahahha i expect to see some 09 skyline or NSX. I didn't notice any familiar actors. Maybe they are famous in Germany but not to the USA. The scene where the cop threw his pee to capture the thieves was also stupid and awkward to add to the movie (i wonder if that is how they capture thieves in Germany).
