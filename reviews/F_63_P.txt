It's no Hana-bi
This film falls somewhere between Fireworks and Postman Blues, without approaching the greatness of either. The principal problem seems to be a serious lack of depth and excessively sappy treatment where the title character, Failan herself, is concerned. Demands for sympathy are so obvious and pathetic that the film is stripped of much of its potential emotion.While there are excellent performances all around, and moments of brilliance in direction and cinematography, the script itself seems to be so lop-sided in terms of its focus on the two worlds of the main characters, that it makes one question why any of Failan's life is shown at all. Indeed, the final sequence would have been much more effective otherwise.
