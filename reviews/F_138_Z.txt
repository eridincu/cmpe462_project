WHY DID THE COMEDY STOP?
The movie starts out as a comedy with unlikely scenarios and amusing dialogue. Fay Grim's husband,Henry FOOL, a former garbage man, is on the lam for killing a man. Her brother Simon Grim is in prison for aiding him. Fay lives off her brother's royalties for his poetry writing (Who does that?). At one point the principle of her son's school suggests she move. Jeff Goldblum shows up as a CIA agent, and not a geek scientist, to ask Fay for assistance. Henry has written some books, rejected by the publisher as gibberish, only to find out that the fantastic stories in his diaries are true and the CIA wants them. Fay encounters a number of spy rings who shoot each other in a series of something one might expect in a Pink Panther movie. The film moves about with plot twists until Fay decides to take matters into her own hands. When Fay goes to Turkey, all of a sudden the movie stops any attempt at humor and suddenly shifts into a serious mode. Unfortunately by this time the plot is so twisted you really don't know who to root for or even care. You just want the movie to get on the lite side again and it never does.
