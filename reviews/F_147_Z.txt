husband and wife team must solve a murder
Busby Berkeley did direct films during the 1930s and 1940s, but he's probably best known for his eye-popping camera angles, synchronized dancing, and row upon row of dance and song numbers. Husband and wife Joel and Garda go on vacation, and somehow Joel ends up as judge for the beauty pageant (...?). Strange enough plot... but the fake accents we hear from the contestants are even more strange. There's a subplot where the pageant runners are planning to run off with the dough, so that's going on too. Ann Sothern and Franchot Tone star in this silly fluff from MGM. It's so goofy that a cop from their hometown follows them on vacation. This one goes all around the mulberry bush... even using the clich√© where the chief of police tells Joel he'll get locked up if he interferes any more. Sothern over-acts, stomps around, and yells all her lines. She had been in the biz for years now, so she should know better. There ARE some fun, old timer folks from vaudeville in here, like the "Captain" with his lions, but the plot is just silly. Historically, i guess it's interesting to see one of the films directed by Berkeley himself. Unfortunately, we don't get to see a big fancy dance number in this one. Wikipedia claims he was married six times, but we only see four spice listed in IMDb....
