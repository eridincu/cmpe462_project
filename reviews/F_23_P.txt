Makes you feel ridiculously confident
First saw a scene of this film back in 2014 and I fell in love with it. For months I couldn't track it down but recently someone recommended it to me. I was so happy to be finally watching it. It really does give one a confidence boost and I felt like I could take on the world after watching it. Love it and definitely recommend it.
