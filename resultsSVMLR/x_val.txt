silly and typical get this as seatback entertainment on delta flight yesterday find it annoy uninteresting and laughable at the same time it typical superhero idiocy here the key to this genre the hero get the snot beat out of him or her suppose until either he decide to fight back in earnest or remembers some secret word which cause something or other to happen by majicks the thing in question open with half dozen cholos steal the wheel off of the title role car while he asleep inside of it he come out and nicely ask these fellow to cease they kill him with shotgun undeterred he return to life and then tear them apart with majick talon which majickly appear at his knuckle see he defeat and then get serious predictable in the extreme really so then he go to some place which look like south new mexico to visit with two oddball who have majick power of course one of them be the old captain of star trek tv series patrick stewart who in wheelchair they be attack by gang copy and paste from road warrior movie lead by bork from star trek m make nothing up the bad guy prevail because it too soon for them not to the captain the guy with the scary knuckle and some girl who be manufacture in mexico via bio lab flee like the movie pay honor to the highly advanced biotech which do exist in mexico in secret about 9 hour later it felt that way the bad guy find and attack the group again this time in hotel casino the captain then paralyze them use his super power give it up in disgust at this point if the captain have use his super power back in new mexico the movie could have end then there a good deal more that detest in this mess but you get my take 8 star this one other than production value should be less than planet 9
cool interactive road trip softcore this review contain spoiler here the plot brian have fight with his girlfriend monica renee rea thinking she through with him he agree to go to malibu with his friend zach there a sorority party there that suppose to be guarantee weekend of eager horny woman monica find out and convince her friend ashley tracy ryan to help her chase him down so she can tell him she still love him that alone probably would have be good enough to make this an above average softcore film but the producer have also throw in another little bit of fun throughout the film there be several place where the character be face with decision the viewer get to decide what they do it a good use of dvd technology and keep thing interest the story provide plenty of opportunity for numerous sex scene and ample amount of female skin there a sexy hitchhiker stephanie schwartz the mechanic horny wife susan featherly and two hot female cop kira reed and nikki fritz there be nine sex scene five be boy girl one be boy girl boy girl two be girl girl and one be girl solo in addition there be nice shower scene with renee and wet shirt contest that renee and tracy participate in all the woman be super hot and give great performances the music be little too loud but you can still hear the sound of the actor during the sex scene
do you like go to the zoo that be the question although be fan of the harry potter series have no preconceived notion or requirement for this stand alone movie other than an expectation that k rowling would not disappoint nonetheless be disappoint the first half of the movie be basically an overlong visit to cgi created zoo we watch as the protagonist hunt down half dozen or so fantastic beast mostly one at time and in extended chase sequence if you do not enjoy visit zoos or watch car chase which have the same dynamic as animal chase no matter how exotic the specie you may be bore certainly be the second half of the movie be more engaging as loose strand from the first be finally weave into conventional good v evil morality play but even here virtually every turn in the plot be easily predictable as rowling use the same pro muggle anti muggle dynamic employ in the potter series to define her character plus an ironically preachy lesson in the harmful nature of organised religion fortunately the actor particularly the good guy and gal be able to overcome the limitation of the script so that couldn help but like them and cheer them on the cinematic recreation of early 20th century new york be also well do however on the whole think rowling be capable of good work than this for movie goer content to be dazzle by special effect this film may do the trick for those who want more than formulaic hagrid save the world knock off the film will probably seem much long than its two hour run time
good to pass rainy day although this isn my typical pick on movie d love to see have to say enjoyed screen this one the run time be bit long and the movie get bit soft in the middle but consider you re actually watch two love story as oppose to one guess the run time be justified it still seem bit force to get the story tell in descent amount of time still over two hour the performance be moderate to good with exception of jude law as graham who be wonderful if you re tire of holiday film that be so stacked with so much christmas cheer that it make you sick this be the perfect alternative light enough for some serious laugh and with enough drama to keep it interest to audience this one a good date movie leave the kid with sitter there be few adult theme that could be uncomfortable to try to explain to young one
awful be compliment the screenplay be below average the actor performance be below average but overall what be irritate most be that blonde woman always smile and joke evening in serious moment bounce like chicken with finger in the as surely in real life her iq be low than drunk snail
depress from start to finish read all the glow review here m wonder if we ve all watch the same film or if ve slip into parallel universe in which this movie be actually great or if m just an alien from another planet with very different taste honestly this must be one of the bad film ve see anyway this be what didn like about this film 1 mindless over the top violence gruesome macabre fight scene even include the scene feature child 2 excessive swearing which seem both force and out of character 3 terrible portrayal of two of the most loved character in the men universe can see reviewer wax lyrical about how this be great send off for these character you must be joke iron man death in avenger endgame be fit send off not this rubbish 4 poor dialogue writing can recall single noteworthy dialogue in the entire movie some people have compare this movie to deadpool well at least deadpool have its fair share of wit and humour this movie be just sad and depress throughout 5 there be recur theme in the movie that whoever be good to someone else or try to help someone else end up dead in the most brutal manner possible so whether it be caliban gabriela the munsons professor or wolverine they all pay heavy price for just be good great way to subconsciously put the idea in people head that just be nice be go to backfire in big way it both surprising and sad to see movie like this with all the violence gloomy theme bad writing and negative energy be rat 8 by viewer maybe its just reflection of the kind of society we live in these day
another overly simplistic biopic find these biopics very hard to watch though this be good than most the bad part of this movie be the hypocrisy at one point the main character ron argue that study in the lancet prove that certain drug work drug that he be prevent from get access to yet theme throughout the movie involve an evil hospital doctor try to stop people use drug that work so he can test drug so pharmaceutical company can get rich how would he test that drug use exactly the same method that be use in the lancet paper indeed as be present it difficult to know if something be work or not if patient be take range of drug you can attack the scientific method and applaud it simultaneously in many way this be an advertisement for cowboy science which as numerous scandal over the year have show be not good idea regardless of how desperate you be of course the desperate patient or their family will probably be sue the company and hospital if the drug be later show to be harmful and if it wasn test properly this movie be lawyer delight unfortunately the movie didn get much beyond politician explain war in term of good guy and bad guy the performance be pretty good though the script be not memorable don think ll be quote line from this movie it could have be such well movie if it be present in realistic grey rather than straight black and white the story have be give the hollywood treatment and they know what they re do it get the crowd

a classic this picture take the happily ever after myth of hollywood stardom and shatters it for good when talk picture become the standard virtually overnight the big studio turn their collective back on most of the silent icon that have help build them this film offer frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icon into despair and madness and for silent film buff offer rare opportunity to see the like of anna nilsson and buster keaton in speak cameo this film greatly push the limit during time where the code rule over hollywood real trend setter
anachronistic melodramatic take on discrimination against civil right era domestic worker the help be well mean attempt to educate the film go public about the civil right era in the deep south through the perspective of the relationship between black maid and their white female employer author kathryn stockett who write the book on which the film be base do well in remind us that the black help not only have to endure the threat of violence as result of the encroach backlash from white racist upset over new black militancy in southern community but also have to deal with multiplicity of indignity on the drab domestic front include be force to use separate bathroom in the home of their white female employer not only do hilly holbrook the film principal villain enforce this rule in her own home and influence her immediate neighbor to follow suit but lobby local politician in order to have her racist initiative be codify into law while hilly may be tad bit melodramatic as stockett cruella de vil she be undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film stockett also do well with elizabeth leefolt aibileen racist employer who be perhaps more repulsive than hilly in that she do not have the self awareness to realize that she be an incompetent mother occasionally stockett even suggest that some of oppressed maid may not have all their moral compass in order in perhaps one of the most interesting scene in the film due to the ambiguity one of the maid be roughly pull off bus and arrest by seemingly racist redneck policeman could hear the indignant sound of the audience suddenly go quiet when it reveal that the maid arrest be the one who pilfer diamond ring that have fall behind cabinet in the home of one of the white employer despite stockett noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s her main character skeeter feel wholly anachronistic it as if stockett project her own modern day sensibility on to skeeter and ask us to believe that such character would have exist at that time if there be progressive mind white liberal participate in the civil right movement in the early 60s usually they come from the north and be often meet with outright violence to have such progressive mind white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black help let alone create book base on interview with such woman be simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author stockett be obviously try to mitigate some of her own guilt by create the illusory feel good character of skeeter no book like the help ever appear in the early 60s and it would have never be publish at that time there another reason why the help make little sense why would the help ever agree to skeeter plan they certainly receive little financial compensation for their effort and in the end they re only set themselves up for retaliation character in book might take some satisfaction in mouth off against an employer who subject them to racist humiliation but in the real world and especially in the 60s deep south one doesn talk back unless one want to lose their sole source of support of course there be individual black woman who work as maid who could have talk back and lose their job but to suggest such large group of woman agree to interview en masse be another one of stockett feel good conceit while all those juicy interview stockett collect from the help may have work in the book the story come off as dry recitation in the film we don actually experience the maid story visually they be merely communicate to skeeter during the interview obviously flashback wouldn have work during the interview scene since there be too many of them stockett other big problem with the help be that she force to place her main help character on pedestal yes aibileen and minny be victim but can they do no wrong it may have be more interesting story if the help be really tell from their perspective stockett unfortunately be unable to make the help world come alive do they actually have back story the best we get be an allusion to minny abusive husband who never appear on screen or be everything define by their relationship to the white world stockett resort to melodramatic form by offer up storytelling akin to decidedly unsubtle quid pro quo you have your evil hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind cecelia foote another unbelievable character design to prove that white weren all that bad during the era even charlotte skeeter mother must be subject to stockett quid pro quo treatment charlotte channel hilly when she banish beloved family maid constantin in order to appease her racist club member but then stick up for skeeter when hilly try to blackmail her daughter worst of all be stockett male character who be practically non existent in the film didn buy for one second that skeeter would have actually be attract to the boyfriend and go out with him for time wouldn she have clarify from the beginning that he be racist and have nothing to do with him for those who be interested in get good picture of black life during the civil right era can recommend the classic 1964 picture nothing but man the help only seem to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aid black people in their quest for social equality and justice

bad film ever to achieve distribution have judge several film festival entry so have see bad film under the skin be among the bad have ever see for plethora of reason bad sound bad camera work bad editing and bad direct it obvious the director be attempt to replicate the surreal mood of lynch and kubrick but he miss the mark in every way generally surreal visual imagery can be effective if it be cohesively tie into story or character the director of this film force several contrived and irrelevant scene into the final cut in sad effort to be creative but he just couldn pull it off if you want to see scarlett johansen gorgeous nude body go see this film otherwise rent real kubrick film and see what true artist can create
not always believable but highly entertaining portrait of slick shyster attorney base on the michael connelly novel the lincoln lawyer pull you in right away with its intriguing title will it be about an attorney who know for his honesty just like our legendary 16th president not quite the lincoln lawyer be mick haller matthew mcconaughey slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conduct most of his business inside his age lincoln continental town car but in sense the parallel between haller and honest abe be not completely off base like president lincoln haller have an incredible command of the law and more importantly he cultivate the right connection which enable him to call in favor at crucial moment guarantee his success haller be one of those character that may be little too cool to be believable nonetheless film audience will identify with haller as man who be never intimidate consider how he not afraid to demand more money from his client member of motorcycle gang who now in trouble with the law and when he meet up with the head of the gang to demand payment he have no trouble ask for an additional 10 000 there also humor to be find here when haller be grant continuance from the judge for his biker client after advise the court that he need more time to question new witness mr green green of course be the additional fund owe to him by the biker gang the film neo noir narrative conveys heady verisimilitude of the california criminal justice system for example when haller meet with former drug addict client who now be re arrest again for drug he advise her that she go to have to do some jail time as she already be through pre trial rehab when the addict agree to give up confederate haller get her back in pre trial rehab an event which later figure prominently in the plot we break into the second act when haller be introduce by bail bondsman to new client louis roulet young blueblood from rich beverly hill family who turn out to be psychopath and possible serial killer roulet play menacingly well by ryan phillippe have be charge with beat up prostitute but claim he be set up by her along with sleazy associate haller soon establish link between former client martinez who be accuse of murder prostitute donna renteria in the same way the current victim be assault both have wound on only one side of their face when he visit martinez at san quentin and show him photograph of roulet martinez win even look at it as he bitter at haller for not believe in his innocence at the time of trial and force him to accept plea bargain which send him up the river for at least fifteen year be not entirely convince that martinez wouldn have entertain haller offer to at least listen to what he have to say in an attempt to make thing right haller conscript an investigator who he work with frank levin william macy former police officer who look like an age hippie to see if there a connection between roulet and the early victim haller be murder after leave cryptic message on haller voice mail indicating he be on to something roulet break into haller home and admit that he guilty of murder renteria but invokes attorney client privilege to keep haller quiet roulet go beyond the usual serial killer routine murder prostitute when he threaten to harm haller wife maggie play by an underutilized marisa tomei and their daughter while it may have be stretch to believe that most serial killer such as roulet would include his own attorney as one of his target the way in which haller figure out how to undermine roulet without lose the case be quite ingenious haller call in favor 1 from his drug addict client who he get into pre trial rehab she fill jail house snitch corliss in on the fact that renteria have sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have know the assistant da put corliss on the stand but haller discredit him by cite case in which corliss testimony result in an innocent man be convict roulet case be dismiss but he detain for question due to corliss testimony about renteria special tattoo haller enrages roulet by imply that he be responsible for set up corliss testimony once roulet be temporarily detain haller figure that enough time to get to maggie sister house where maggie and the daughter be hide so he can intercept the now out of control roulet and call in favor 2 from the biker gang honcho the once calculate but now impulsive roulet show up at maggie right on schedule and the gang member end up beat him up in broad daylight not likely but again entertaining when haller figure out that levin have discover roulet park ticket put him near the scene of renteria murder along with martinez possible id and corliss testimony about the spider tattoo that may be enough to put roulet away for good wasn very surprised by roulet mother admit to kill levin and also shoot haller as it be pretty obvious from the get go that the mother son relationship wasn very kosher the lincoln lawyer may be nothing more than an extended law order episode but it still highly entertaining didn buy all of it especially the rather easy way in which haller prevent the killer from do harm to his family also wasn entirely convince that the da really have enough evidence to convict roulet at second trial nonetheless the lincoln lawyer with its realistic atmosphere and excellent performance prove to be notch above many of film in wide release today
hey you bastards m still here this be film that think have all the potential to be classic base on the memoir of the same name that m sure have an embellishment or two about tale of survival and escape and perseverance and head by genuine movie star in mcqueen in spot it can be great there be moment right after the trio escape the prison that dega fall down in agony while papillon discovers that the boat they have be promise be rotten and no good mcqueen burst into an uncharacteristic rage at the man he have just spend 2 year in solitary confinement for and it could have be visceral moment of pure emotion have be foil after the escape they have plan for so long but it lose its power because mcqueen chooses to put on this overwhelming sneer which feel petty rather than be bear of desperation and fear of once again be prisoner both of them be convince enough hoffman dega wear pair of spectacle that balloon his pupil and give him this distinctly endear geekiness he frequently slip into his past persona as if he be once more selling counterfeit war bond and appeal to men and their patriotic pride and generosity these sort of connive salesman be easy to befriend and to gain trust but do it ever go beyond that papillon may be good man than because it be hard to identify anything in their friendship that be worth those two torturous year in dark cell he tear up upon the end of that sacrifice and as he make his final leap to freedom but be there really any substance to warrant it it have trouble decide what sort of film it should be there humour when dega intention of luxury be foil and we cut suddenly to the backbreaking kilo 40 and when they encounter crocodile and banter over who remove it when papillon be abuse by the prison guard the soundtrack balloon and exaggerate the hit and zoom in eagerly just to make sure we understand the impact and there be several hallucination dream sequence which seem to belong to another film altogether but speak so plainly and vaguely of theme that could apply to almost anything these be much less effective than mcqueen himself in the most haunting scene he mutter wish to confess but painstakingly resist the urge he hold back tear his lip tremble and we can see every ounce of pain and sheer will in the bloodshot eye of man who so diligently value and chase his freedom and choose to forgo it for friend later as he leave his second spell of confinement this one 5 year we see its effect via makeup that have make his body weak his hair white and his speech haggard but it do not seem as bad as before this be an issue of pace we spend entirely too much time in the first prison and little after it it seem to be 2 hour film that have somehow conjure an extra half an hour in excess there be an wordless sequence where papillon stumble upon native colony and somehow manages to befriend them and even find romance and it be the most clichéd insufferable and unnecessary segment of them all similarly they also stumble upon leper colony and papillon be once again hit treat them with empathy as if they be human being too and gain their assistance but at least this be do with sincerity schaffner big triumph be that it feel epic in scale the focus stretch into infinity and show just how isolated the prisoner be from the modern and civilised world but also how beautiful and crazy the wild be as they talk of escape with desire in their eye the endless sea horizon bobble in the background silver of light in the cramped boat hold reveal the shiny sheen of the prisoner sweaty body they work in the forest rain hail or sun as papillon be drag to confinement they pass idyllic beach front which be swap for the grimy grey wall that he lose sanity in koenekamp silhouette character at golden hour paddle upstream on pure white hawaiian style beach drink coconut juice and atop the cliff of devil island which contrary to its name be cover in palm tree piglet and stream full of crayfish it seem like paradise at least accord to dega but be be not freedom and in the final shot we glide over and reveal the triumphant papillon who shout jubilantly even as he have mile and mile of deep blue ocean still to traverse this could have felt magnificent but it be merely satisfy

boring and unfunny basically nothing of substance happen during the entire movie ok my title be tad bit harsh but it be basically how feel about this after watch it it be certainly not all boring and think as whole be more watchable than some other movie but for comedy be not what be expect there be not even moment of laughter during the whole movie let alone small chuckle feel this could just as easily be call drama instead of comedy and it could have easily end after twenty minute or go on another 2 hour and either way feel the audience would end up know the character just as well and have just as good story tell the acting be great and find the individual character likable the tiny amount that know them but find the story to be very thin without any substance and character development to be non existent culminating by go nowhere and simply end on flat note
to predictable well had high hope for this movie but it fell way short be hop it would keep me guess but this movie be easy to predict what be go to happen though do think the acting be good by both main star jason 3
a tale about 2 disrespectful kid the 2 kid in this be pure evil it hard to hope they have happy end when they seem to love to torture their elder in this ice cube play nick guy who like lady suzzanne with 2 nasty kid suzzanne have to go to canada for her job and nick volunteer to take the kid there on new year eve they have problem at the airport and bus station so must travel in nick new suv to get there the kid make mess inside the car they lock him outside and try to drive away they make truck driver think they need help so he run nick off the road eventually the suv be total the kid run away to their dad and be disappoint with what they find but didn feel bad for them since they be such brat eventually they all make it to suzzanne party and after all nick go through she act ungrateful and doesn care her kid be so evil but since it a kid movie you know they all end up forgive each other and happy at the end final verdict don recommend it because the kid be so mean if you don like the kid you can hope they end up happy what they deserve be switch

a simple typical movie typical romantic movie indeed it be like most of the 1990 movie nothing be new the only enjoyable scene find be the one in which andy go to the guy family house and play the game of bullshit and at the end be expect the same termial end in which the guy be run behind the girl on the airport terminal however to my big surprise the guy catch her on the bridge so that be new thing the acting by both kate and mathew be good but again think the story didn have that much in it to make use of the expeties of these good actor and still cant figure out why the friend of the hero always have to be that lame as the two guy in this movie
g force movie review have to hand it jerry bruckheimer be there anything this man can do never think he could pull off family animation film and he have without flaw force disney new animated 3 movie experience be wonderful and fun film that kid as well as parent can enjoy my wife who be in her 40 love it and laugh intensely throughout the film particularly at tracey morgan guinea pig character blaster the story be about team of specially train secret agent guinea pig that take on mission for the us government they re dispatch to stop diabolical billionaire who plan to take over the world with household appliance bite ridiculous right yes but it make for infant the voice here be top notch except for penelope cruz who seem uncomfortable voice animation always have think that be talent very different from be in front of camera and not everyone will equate their on screen performance with their off screen performance tracey morgan be the highlight but it be nicolas cage who surprise everyone by change his voice for the mole character speckle the voice be unrecognizable on interesting note at press conference cage speak about how his kid didn know he voice the character and the same go for all his work because he want to shield them from his celebrity essentially he imply that his child have no idea he a big time hollywood superstar and will do everything from them ever know interest huh the 3 experience be the best ve ever see and m not just say that kid be so lucky that this film be make for them and not adults the director hoyt yeatman visual effect guru personally tell me that he finish render the film just last week be you kid me not to get too technical but the reason for such an onerous task be the attention to detail accord to yeatman the rendering take year with several hundred people work on it if this isn a labor of love than don know what be but it show and we re all lucky for it overall think the film be funny visually please and the pacing be never dull or incongruent force be make for kid but parent be go to be pleased applaud right into first place at the box office funny enough ask jerry bruckheimer if there be sequel in the work and he say if we fill the seat with happy customer we ll do another one that not go to be problem
drag on have to watch this for class and boy do it drag on like old film and this one start out well it be interest and have me intrigue but quickly become bore it drag on and on focus on seemingly unimportant detail the last fifteen minute would would have be good receive and maybe even shock if the movie as whole be well wasn remotely invest in these character
watch hair grow in real time let me recap kid be be bear as old man as he grow he be become young and young until he shrink and die at infant age as he grow old younger in fact he watch everyone around him become old and old he watch others die in fact he watch them die even more as he be bring up in retirement home as he be grow up no one seem to be ask any question regard his situation everyone seem to be perfectly all right with their observation not one visit to doctor nothing although everyone around him seem to care lot for him throughout the movie many duh wisdom relate to life and death be be quote these quote oversimplify reality to the extend that it make you think than nothing else seem to matter it seem that idea be something like once we quote these the audience will forget about the sheer stupidity of the story give the review here on imdb they may have be right too understand that this movie suppose to have some deep meaning and think understand what it intend to be in stead though it have become cross in between forrest gump legend of the fall and many other movie result in over two and half hour of absolutely nothing three oscars come on guy this movie be bad
not scary this movie be so so so retarded it be hardly consider scary doll kill people please how much more stupid can it get don think that the sequel be that scary either maybe if they didn have him come back to life every time he be kill it might actually make some money and actually be somewhat scary the seed of chuckie be the least scary britney spear well whoever write this movie have some serious problem at first use to be so scared of it but then it kinda hit me that it be retard because it not realistic at all maybe they should make reproduction of this movie scary one until then guess ll just have to live
most over rat film ever think this film be hot candidate for most over rat ever it a run of the mill boxing film which suddenly turn into sob story of euthanasia which remind me most of an afternoon tv drama design solely to make the viewer cry danielle steele would have be embarrass the exaggerated caricature of the girl white trash family would have ruin good film but in this one be past caring when they show up and try to trick her out of her earnings they could have have it for all care if it have end the film right there still the second part be more interesting than the prolonged and predictable box part it a mystery to me how film with so little finesse innovation and realism can win so much praise and an oscar almost fell sleep in my seat
bad write no amount of act and effect can make up for terrible write let just say they set up certain thing in the movie and then never use them you re like oh the beginning of the movie say this but don expect anything to happen because bad write it really peak near the beginning then really drag on there fight scene near the end that be endless unbelievable really repetitive the climax be anticlimactic so there be potential for good movie and the actor do fine but the character didn act like real people it be so obvious what be go on but they drag on every single story element and repeat it feel bad for these actor truly waste of money and talent part of the reason it be so bad be because it have an intellectual level of spy kid super predictable and stereotypical moment but place and set up so poorly that they have no emotional depth it check all the box except be interesting and have good plot you know like miss the whole point of movie
terrific movie if relentlessly gritty and realistic remember see schindler list about ten year ago and remember how weird felt for be almost completely unmoved by it although it show the horror of holocaust quite realistically somehow it all seem just bit too fake and exaggerated character be bit off still can decide who be more over the top schindler or goeth fake sentimentalism be all over the place while it be work of art and an important reminder of true event that shouldn be forget on emotional level it just somehow fail to deliver enter the pianist with no spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material we finally have movie that show the true horror and tragedy of jewish people in world war ii the story be tell through the eye of one man wladislaw szpielman jewish pianist who work in radio station in warsaw during the german occupation of poland together with him we watch his world get torn apart witness his family be take away his existence be reduce to bare essential brody give subtle yet spectacular performance his best work yet and never once be we remind that we be watch movie everything be show from szpielman point of view and it be all very gritty and realistic while spielberg rendition of german atrocity always have slightly stag feel to augment their dramatic purpose here they be so true to life there impact be much great you watch and be be remind in horror that this thing actually happen while be very hard to watch sometimes this be movie that schindler list be suppose to be this movie doesn judge anybody or try to explain anything it show historical event as reflection of one man fate make powerful testimony that stay with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credit be over
great movie more thriller than horror after wait to see this movie for over two and half year wasn disappoint with the end result wouldn call this horror film as it describe online but there be few time when felt creep out while be watch consider the fact that this film be suppose to be the beginning of trilogy the director do really good job with fix up all the loose end so it wouldn end off as such there be good character development good action sequence with comedy bit and touch moment so overall good film also like how they make reference to the fox men universe which to me be important in film series however do wish it have more jump scare and creepy moment which be why deducted point who know maybe they have to cut lot of it out due to it be give pg 13 film rating either way if you re fan of the fox universe of men d recommend this film
interesting movie but fail attempt to look credible in the dvd director commentary the director say they take great care in make alex look credible as priest traditionalist priest at that because it be crucial that the audience buy into him be priest if they re go to buy into the plot at all clearly the director and producer didn know much about catholicism in the beginning we see alex vesting and say mass in latin while they make sure to put traditional garment on him they entirely miss what be perhaps the most obvious mass vestment the chasuble this be great oversight because no traditionalist priest would miss the chasuble do so would be sinful canon law say celebrate mass without the appropriate vestment be mortal sin additionally the old school priest always wear their stole so that they cross their chest in an not hang straight down as alex do that be reserve for bishop you might also note that the word alex say when he give communion corpus christi be the not the word from the latin mass corpus domini nostri jesu christi custodiat animam meam in vitam aeternam amen this seem odd as they pair heath up with priest to do the latin so the scene would appear real the major plot flaw however be the integral scene of mara as she lay die alex doesn want to take over as the sin eater but be force by eden who stag mara death alex note that he no longer priest so he can grant her absolution for her sin thus out of desperation he use the sin eater ritual to take away her sin this be horribly inaccurate catholic theology both traditional and contemporary teach that once priest be ordain he be priest forever even if he be depose by the church or if he step down as priest in which case he be simply forbidden from do priestly duties canon law at the same time specifically note that if someone be about to die former priest not only can absolve her but be morally obligate to do so don know how the writer miss this it hold true in roman catholicism eastern orthodox anglicanism and old catholicism aside from those two point line in part of the movie don seem to flow well or be realistic too the scene of desperate mara throw paper and book at eden on the stairwell doesn seem very realistic despite all this the movie be interest and new perspective on the church do like it and even buy the dvd m just little disappointed with some of the aspect of it
incredibly bore this film be just monumental bore have even conduct straw poll amongst my colleague in the it system support dept and have yet to find anyone who have actually watch suffer this movie right to the end the animation may be good but the story be immensely dull and ponderous wonder just what be suppose to be the target audience for this movie my eight year old daughter find that much of the dialogue be too grow up for her whilst my wife and find much of it to be down at cartoon level and rather too simplistic for an adult audience at least we be able to enjoy watch shark tale as family as it work on several level heartily recommend the incredibles as cure for insomnia
unintentionally funny 1984 type movie saw be for vendetta with group of eight we be the type who like action and sophisticated film this film do not make the cut we come out laugh wonder what waste of time overall think we think it be 4 of 10 give it low since it be waste of natalie portman john hurt and stephen rhea and lot of money what make it silly be that it take neo nazi totalitarian regime and give it credibility in future england like society can see that happen john hurt be easy to see through as an evil prime minister but can million of people be that naive perhaps in less sophisticated or educate society or third world culture but almost definitely not modern western society terrorism conduct by in his mask become justified to combat nazi like totalitarianism ok but conduct by man who wear silly mask be that truly credible brazil and 1984 also with john hurt be far good film and still not great film furthermore the political monologue by be not inspire it be like watch clown try to recite serious hamlet monologue hard to take serious even the cinematography be not particularly great but at least bit atmospheric the end be downright silly as the climax build up to date to remember so the movie claim but perhaps date to forget if you watch the end plain dumb at least give the audience more credit for believable movie
iffy first half strong second despite world of hype and great word of mouth batman begin kind of fizzle begin tediously and nearly save itself with an excellent second half it good not great cap crusader pulp fiction well than batman and robin and batman return but not quite as good as the second original batman well know comic book character have an albatross around its neck its own history since we know lot about batman the movie about his genesis have to really convince us it the same guy it have to be sincere well batman begin be awfully earnest perhaps much too earnest and the origin of certain of his trademark be well explain but the movie suffers from noncharismatic lead and tone that seem more suit to generic james bond movie let star with bat himself christian bale bale be perhaps best know as the serial killer in american psycho and while play psychotic might well prepare one for be batman he simply doesn provide enough oomph to the role remember the role demand that the actor be hide in lycra suit for good deal of the movie so he have to be expressive with his face command with his voice strong presence in other word bale doesn quite accomplish any of this he come off as more of poor man tom cruise with limited facial expression and emotion plus and don mean to be unkind here bale have gigantic light bulb for head bruce wayne suppose to be somewhat suave keep look for the dangly chain to make him light up move on we see the highly publicize katie holmes as the requisite love interest rachel dawes holmes be amusingly miscast far too much of lightweight for the role her character be suppose to be in her twenty but poor katie act and look like she still in high school as with bale look in vain for something class ring in holmes case at any rate she about as convincing as chris farley as the pope there not much chemistry between her and bale in the few scene they share and she seem like she only four lesson into ten lesson course of act with an luckily the support gang be quite good this be what happen when you hire talented veteran talent the elegant michael caine be onboard as alfred bruce butler and muse caine be bear for the veddy proper role and one can easily see the latter day alfred michael gough in the other film in caine portrayal morgan freeman be lucius fox the scientist who get bruce his cool gadget and rutger hauer be the nominal bos of wayne enterprise megalomaniacally try to take over the company or something hauer sort of wasted any eurotrash would have do as well in the role but most of the other major support character be the underwire to the bra of the plot that a good thing for all you virgin male out there director christopher nolan be the guy who give us memento and insomnia but the trouble here be that there nothing christopher nolan like about the movie tim burton batman have tim burton write all over it and that one thing that make it as successful as it be but normally with movie in series for example the bond film it not necessary to get big name director to do the deed you just need someone who will be true to the oeuvre the bat universe in this case so although it nifty that they get the hot nolan to direct don think it be necessary batman begin isn badly write at all but the first half do seem awfully slow get to the good stuff you may whine let lay off this jam bond crap and get to the avenge death of parent bit it good that we learn why bruce choose the batman name how he come upon his cape and gadget where the batmobile come from and when the bat signal be first use but we need to see all that mystical be the one mumbo jumbo felt like d stumble upon an old mountain dew commercial

man of steel be not superman if you be die hard superman fan then be ready for huge disappointment not for moment will you get the overwhelming warmth in your heart when superman save the day which you get when christopher reeve play superman this be just another film which lack totally lacks solid story and the maker be completely confident that they will fool the audience again with massive unnecessary special effect same go with iron man 3 lois lane be apparently more smart than man of steel as she somehow manages to be present at all the location where man of steel be about to fall come back home and watch the real superman just to erase this bad portrayal of my favorite superhero
silly fun knight and day be an action comedy center on fugitive couple cruise and diaz on glamorous and sometimes deadly adventure where nothing and no one even themselves be what they seem amid shift alliance and unexpected betrayal they race across the globe with their survival ultimately hinge on the battle of truth v trust m not gon na fool anyone knight and day be 100 pure formula it have be do countless time and for the most part it be corny and campy at the same time it silly harmless fun and that why be able to enjoy it have say that with any other two lead this film would have be absolutely terrible it work mainly because cruise be incredibly charismatic and truly movie star as in most film try to be everything at the same time knight and day have an identity crisis the comedic part be not that funny and the action sequence and there quite few of them be not that impressive specially if you consider some cruise previous work in fact would say this be probably one of cruise bad film and yet he the reason why the film be watchable cameron diaz reprise her role as the silly and ingenious blonde which be basically all she ever do peter sarsgaard have very small role and isn even worth mention overall knight and day be only watchable it one of those pop corn flick where you have to turn your brain off if you have any intention of have good time
average comedy not good but not too bad have to write short review of this some of the top review of this movie be obviously make by someone affiliate with the movie in some way the movie be mildly entertain the plot be the main guy that want to declare his love for his old girlfriend the side story be about an old guy who want to spread his dead wife ash by some shore or other the side plot isn execute very successfully the acting be ok although the side kick get to be annoy be hop for few laugh but didn laugh once in the course of this movie it be bit funny at time so smiled and that it if you have nothing else to do or if you really like zombie theme movie by all mean see it you re not gon na walk away very satisfied though manage to sit though it entirety m start to think that should have spend it sleep instead goodnight
absolute garbage one of the bad movie ve see yet the movie lack personality be incredibly boring and end waaay too early it be unfunny unoriginal and be obviously just cash grab
preposterous self indulgent and little boring there aren many film where think may actually walk out but after the 20 minute but seriously think about it it do get bit well thereafter though character development be poor do care much for the character little bit of effort be expend in try to inject some emotion but mostly it fall very flat saw this film in 3d why do pay premium for this in some of the hand to hand fight sequence you can barely see what happen the effect be akin to watch clothes go round and round in wash machine 3d technology appear to be very lack for fast close action fight sequence the story be weak with action explosion be the main selling point of this movie if you go with very low expectation you may come away feel it be an ok movie unfortunately for me will lament those 2 hour of wasted time
quarter inch pace it a little different ll give it that but that doesn mean it good it try real hard to be edgy but really it just pretentious pattinson be fine with what be give to him but his character be not interesting in the least and just come off as rich brat who be inferior and less interesting than every other character he come in contact with now to be fair have not read the book so just may not connect with the film like kevin durand and paul giamatti but both of their screentime be quite limited see that the film be try to make the audience see the world from certain point of view and the direction that society be head m just not buy it so if anything it interest as whole and at least make you contemplate on society and its current state the pace of the movie be quite similar to how the traffic be describe within the film move in quarter inch
dire three hour film about walk the problem with this film be not it look as it do look amaze but it length and confusing nature now if you ve read the book then dare say you have an idea what go on but if you haven then what be tell be an awesome epic become rather long film involve walking and boy do they walk they walk up hill through forest cave and over mountain and then then walk some more another fault with the film be that although the cast have be assemble to be true to the book none of them have any presence at all it all make you wish that someone with some charisma would turn up in car and get on with it
a slice of awesome this movie be by far the most exciting super hero movie yet please be warn this movie be extremely inappropriate but an absolute thrill ride ryan reynolds as deadpool be the perfect fit just when you think he could not get any more clever with his word he would say the most off the wall comment possible the fighting sequence in this be incredibly jaw drop deadpool really be one of the most innovative fighter have see his technique be totally unorthodox and can not be match nor mimic by any other who dare the only thing that be not satisfy be the length of the movie it be much short than expect the backstory to wade wilson before become deadpool be short live despite that it still be an excellent movie and can not wait for more

directional creative misser be no serb croat bosnian the film tell nothing about event have encounter whatsoever so have no interest whatsoever in choose side be just someone who enjoy cinema if it good but this film hold almost nothing pour moi the script seem to lead nowhere seriously have the feeling few time that the director lose all control as to where we where head mean we watch couple dance suddenly there an explosion en after that there be no reference to that explosion what so ever when they later meet again it as if they never saw each other before the character study be awfully weak and stereotypical why bother witch photographical composition well lit scene etc when awful thing like mass rape be take place v read in other review but it be very beautifully photograph in this story that a weakness imo in the first part we see the main character aijla wear lovely yellow colour sweater which give great look camera color composition and atmosphere but why why still bother which such detail to make thing look good on screen while mass rape and murder be take place some script change be absolutely ridiculous and very far fetch another nuisance the constant very close up manner of film the battle scenes find that disturb and style figure and yes many people complain about this in this film about the bosnian carnage the focus lie on the serbian atrocity during this war but that no problem imo this film be story about what happen to part of the bosnian victim the serbian side of the bosnian war story may be tell by another film my main objection be the creative shortcoming it to me be bore movie and should hold lesson in filmmaker vision for jolie next time well this film to me look like schoolgirl naive sentiment in view the horror of war but those horror be not present in horrible way presume the situation in reality be hell we see very stylish hell with neat frame scene an unbelievable and for me totally distant sort of love story very weak script to act on it must have be for the actor nice clothing and beautiful light be really in awe as to where the story take me very far fetch and naive and the cast very much stereo type not creative choice of cast why have them speak american with balkan accent you see this in lot of film to make it more realistic but it easily become mediocre it far well strong to have them speak either serb croatian or plain english never understand why they do that and do not break away from such film make dogma let this 1th directional misser be lesson for jolie
interest try want to write lot about this movie but read other review and find out that they describe the film accurately so please read them really do not have anything to add to what other people write about it what want to write about be the actress zana marijanovic since know her personally have to say she be such nice and positive person when she be without boyfriend try to ask her for date she refuse me flat out of course be not from the movie act business but be her fellow sarajevan still even that be not to her liking still when watch her act either in gogo club or in kamerni teatar like her very much she radiate with such positive energy and be such nice person she be bosnian mixture of sandra bullock and angelina jolie
not to say it isn a decent movie just that it so inoffensive safe and cliche that feel like ve see it million time before mortensen and ali be terrific actor and be thankful for them without their charisma and viggo willingness to shove insane amount of food down his throat fear green book would be dead on arrival mostly think this be movie that desperately afraid of offend anyone for instance if there a scene with racist cop there will also be scene with good cop down the road just to make clear that the movie be not state or suggest that all cop be be racist it also funny that the good cop scene happen in the snow to let us know the character be back in blue state where supposedly life wasn so bad for black man after all this be one of the many simplistic move that indicate to me that the filmmaker be willing to sacrifice the complexity of their theme for feel good entertainment the script want both character to learn from each other and eventually change and grow but to make this happen it turn them into unrealistic caricature it a bit frighten how shirley be portray as complete ignorant of black culture but it have to be this way so tony can be the one to introduce him to it tony transformation come simply from witness racism first hand as if he never experience such thing in his life before maybe another consequence of this be blue state red state movie so besides the performance that speak for themselves think it a very uninspired effort at one point the character leave the car for no reason other than to have dramatic confrontation in the rain as if rainy night equal dramatic weight saw it in packed movie theater and people seem to enjoy it you can blame them the movie have now everything fine conclusion that can leave audience in good state of mind but it also show how simplistic it really be
the only thing this film lack be the element of surprise the matrix reload have everything you could possibly want from summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor have heck of lot more and while reload be not as good as the first matrix film it sure be close to the standard of the original don understand the seeming reluctance to accept this film suitable continuation of the original film ll be the first one to admit that reload have few slow point and that the story line have tendency towards the pretentious but the film be also highly intelligent and entertain but most importantly the film get the story from to with adequate and in some case remarkable character development act wise the film be in the same kind of league as the first film of the series with few mediocre performance few decent performance and one or two excellent performance keanu reef play neo pretty much like he do in the first movie and that be not bad his monotone voice be cancel out by his clear and well define body language his overall performance be very fitting for the character which let face it be somewhat square and keanu act fit that kind of character very well carrie anne moss have take small step down don blame her as much as blame the write her character while still ass kicking be too dependent on neo know they love each other but come on laurence fishbourne shine as morpheus his performance be slightly more stylized than in the first film but he steal almost every scene he be in other semi know actor make glorified cameo actor like jada pinkett smith monica bellucci and lambert wilson be great example gloria foster return as the oracle in her sadly last performance as she die during the film her one brief scene be both highly interesting and well act as it be with the first film hugo weave provide the best acting by far although his screen time be somewhat limited he manage to leave lasting impression and become one of my favorite screen baddie of all time his performance be for lack of good word fantastic effect wise reload be feast there be literally something to look at in every scene the real world have be give face lift to make it more interest the real effect however take place inside the matrix and just like in the first film the effect be absolutely ground break rival the like of star war and lotr and that be say something the people who think the story be pretentious and the dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action scenes some scene have me hold my breath and gasp at how beautiful and overwhelm it all be and as much as love the philosophical aspect of the film can watch it for the effect themselves as well without spoil anything can say that lover of cool fight scene and fx be in for hell of treat with this one in term of costume the film have really grow into its own especially neo costume in the matrix be very cool and be great improvement over the previous film morpheus and trinity costume be the same with minor change and they still look cool agent smith costume have change slightly in the color scheme his suit have become bit dark as if to signify that he be no longer an agent of the system but rogue agent now also his sunglass have change so that they look more rounded so they look more like neo sunglass which of course implicates their connection many of the secondary character have their own costume as well mirror their own personality be the film separate itself from other action pack film be of course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspect once the film have be watch few time for the effect you can begin to see some of the element don think its possible to fully translate and analyze every element of the film mainly because every element can be analyze in bunch of different way without spoil too much can say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find plato baudrillard gnosticism buddhism hinduism christian element and some more the people who tell matrix lover to get life for search the matrix for deep meaning ought to open their eye and watch the film one more time with that m not say that you can be intelligent if you don like the matrix be simply ask you to give it another chance you really win regret it the matrix reload be an excellent film and it deserve lot more respect than it be get and it be definitely underrated don expect people to agree but do expect people to respect those who love the matrix sequel like me for one think that its hard to go wrong with reload as it be funny move awe inspiring and very intelligent highly recommend this film to anyone

indiana jones be back when it come to review movie like indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull the hard thing to do be to keep expectation intact and not expect film that will blow raider of the lose ark out of the water it have no chance to beat that expectation and the film will ultimately become failure with that mindset you have to look at this film as another one of the sequel which isn a knock at the the temple of doom and the last crusade on the contrary they re great film but this be the caliber you should expect from the fourth installment of film that hasn see new addition to the franchise since 1989 with this in mind do the fourth indiana jones film succeed the answer an incredibly enthusiastic yes after 19 year away steven spielberg george lucas and harrison ford have recapture that magic that have make the indy trilogy so successful and add worthy sequel that stand right in line with the two sequel the little indy quirk be here the paramount logo fade into mountain like object in the background jones insane phobia of snake the flight path on the background map and the numerous reference to the first three film however and give george lucas and screenwriter david koepp ton of credit for this the film be not simply tribute to the first three film but an intriguing fresh story that be unlike any of the other three this isn rocky balboa where we have the same general story but give new spin on it while some fan will be upset about the departure from the familiar biblical territory the first one cover find it to be great to see new original indy flick instead of rehashed homage to theme previously see spielberg seem to have find that pitch perfect balance between action humor and humanity that make raider so special this isn a flat out comedy like last crusade seemingly be though there be still plenty of humorous moment in this film surprisingly very few joke and gag actually fall flat this isn two hour of non stop action as the film do take its time to establish the plot detail the archaeological quest and let us remember why we fell in love with these character in the first place in fact the scene with marion ravenwood and indy together be gold don get me wrong lot of the action be blast the car chase scene in the jungle be great piece of film making and the first scene with mutt williams and indy leave lasting impression great action doesn have to come in newer advance look cgi extravaganza as spielberg prof that traditional action set piece be still the most entertaining kind there be now about the cast the star be age the sidekick be from even stevens karen allen hasn be in big movie in god know how many year and for some reason people be worry about cate blanchett in here role well let me put the concern to rest the entire cast be establish pitch perfect chemistry and everybody play their part incredibly well harrison ford be for the first time in decade have the time of his life and it show in his excellent return to the famed american icon it no secret that he have be campaign for this movie for year and it show in his strong performance karen allen share fantastic chemistry with both shia labeouf and ford as she provide lot of the necessary charm to the second act of the film blanchett use heavily over the top russian accent but she find just the right note between creepy and intriguing to make her the best indy villain since belloq in raider ray winstone do well enough in his role as do john hurt and jim broadbent the major surprise however be indeed shia labeouf for some strange reason people actually think this guy would be the jar jar binks of the indy series and they couldn be more wrong remember the outstanding chemistry between sean connery and ford in the last crusade the chemistry between labeouf and ford rival that ve believe that he be very good actor for the past few year and one of the few redeeming factor of transformer he do great job in this film the entire cast be good strong story and great performance don imply that this film isn flawless it isn but the flaw be few and far between and didn hind my overall enjoyment of the film the first 20 minute be somewhat slow it take little while to get to marshall college these first twenty minute aren necessarily bore it be still entertain but it could have use probably 5 minute of edits and pace correction this be my big problem with the film and once indy return to marshall college the film really kick off and turn into the roller coaster ride that everyone have be hop for so as you can see dig the film may have even love it repeat viewing should ensure this it be the indy film that you ve be wait for since it be announce and the creative trio have prove that with the right care and intention you can bring an american icon back from the dead and still have him own the competition rip offs like the davinci code and the national treasure series try to be like these film but even the fourth installment of these wonderful franchise just tower over its impersonator this film will go down as very strong entry into the quartet and fall somewhere in the middle of the two sequel when all be say and do the indy film that you ve be dread not even close indiana jones be back

tight lipped in more way than one the debut feature by acclaimed spanish director manuel gutiérrez aragón be an impressive but taciturn fable about publisher linguist who happen upon deaf mute shepherd girl and set out to civilize her through language and etiquette his fascination with her affliction and beauty be balance by his frustration with her ignorance while the trust that slowly develop between them be jeopardize by suspicious townsfolk and by the tutor worry family whose garrulous manner be contrast with the girl proud silence never mind all the allegorical implication involve the suppose isolation of the spanish intelligentsia under the decade long dictatorship of franco near death when the film be make the drama by itself be think provoke and beautifully film but the director oblique narrative style extend no favor to its audience and viewer be oblige to fill in the gap of meaning by themselves

tedious overlong with hope be the second word speak in just about every sentence who care simply fail to understand how this film be so popular it quite simply beyond me the only way can explain it be that all the fan of king short story find it very true to the spirit of the book and vote 10 for that really could not find anything worth my time in this film and apart from very good monologue from freeman near the end one or two good line of dialog and the acting there really nothing in the whole film worth watch it for it about hope and the director win let us forget it so it repeat until the audience mumble it in our sleep it like this short one note story be write and the author just didn want to end it so he keep write and write until someone have the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yell for the love of all that be holy stop writing and thank that faceless man for do that because it be undoubtedly the only reason the film be 142 minute long and not 284 or dare say it 568 the film simply drone on and on scene after scene contain nothing remotely interesting but with excellent act mind you there nothing good about this film except for the acting just about all of it be great can really think of anything else to say guess my dislike for the film stem from my hatred of king write suppose it be possible for someone who be neutral on his work to enjoy this film recommend this to fan of stephen king the actor and possibly frank darabont if you re not fan of any of these people doubt you find this enjoyable 5 10 5
this series be all tell don show and that the problem the concept of show don tell be completely lose on the writer room every character have to describe every other character as the best of the best the best the agency ever have the best ve ever see if you have to tell your audience someone be the best then they be probably not the writer be just get in their own way with excessive dialogue when some simple staging would allow viewer to come to their own conclusion instead we re be tell everything also queen latifah be good actress she be however remarkably miscast in this series the writer aren write to her strength rock solid persona and strong delivery instead they re try to portray her as seasoned fighter and be put her in scene where she show be physically violent those scene fall flat due to the excessive jump cut need to compensate for the actress lack of natural physicality the classic 80 series do this well write for mccall as seasoned veteran in his late 50 v modern spec ops warrior as such the original mccall use intimidation more than direct physical violence as his key weapon this series could be save but it need some heavy rework right now it feel like equalizer in name only brand this as remake of the original series be disservice to all involve instead create brand new character for your very talented lead and stop try to retread the past
kind of complicate atmospheric crime thriller nice shot of the bayou under the opening credit unspoiled river pristine swamp oak drape with spanish moss it all look rather promising guess you can still find such subtle but majestic littoral maybe along route 90 around houma but from most highway in southern louisiana all you see be oily swamp water with derrick plant in it beer can and garbage and quien sabe corpses float in the murk the movie kind of like that too the location shooting be just fine everyone sweat up storm in the heat and humidity and it no wonder that they head for the gin rickey with all that ice new orleans be expose in all its funkiness the french quarter be more or less avoided but we get to see the less neighborhood now drown and empty of human life in the wake of katrina there be the shotgun house of the poor the stripper bar play bluesy music the streetcar travel not through the garden district but through ordinary residential street beautiful in its own rotting way almost phosphorescent with corruption outside the city there be bait shop that rent boat and sell tackle one of these be run by alec baldwin ex cop recover alcoholic the story isn very much when you come right down to it hard to follow at time not really captivate but not absolutely mainstream generic either baldwin have marvelously normal family include steal adopted girl but be accidentally involve in some shenanigan couldn quite follow something about smuggle which draw the attention of the mob baldwin doesn seem to actually do anything that threaten their presence but they surround his house one lightning fill night and do his loving and courageous wife kelly lynch the rest of the plot be revenge story with baldwin track down the killer one by one there be some good action scene chase across the rooftops battle on streetcar all the action be do in slow motion so you get chance to savor it the crash crashing car the catapult body the muzzle flash brilliantly light up the interior of dark house ps mister director can we have moratorium on slow motion death it more than cliché it positively decadent by now let get together and blame sam pekinpah okay think the conclusion be pretty well do after his wife be blast to shred by shotguns an attractive young blond and old friend move into his house in the wood and provide him with some emotional comfort they once be quite close now see baldwin wife be go and he get this little latina girl that he adopt but there a big hole in the nuclear family in other word the guy need wife conventional script call for him to overcome his grief and fall in love with the reassuring and love blond babe but no when he make clear that he hold his wife memory sacred the blond leave him note and take off realize he not ready to get on with his life as they say the last scene have baldwin in his house gaze affectionately at his sleep little girl then fall on his back beside her sense his presence she twist over and put her arm around his chest and he place his hand over hers and stare at the ceiling it be not cheap shot it a brief but genuinely tender scene encompass both love and the loss of it
not worth the praise really do not get the hollywood weakness for everything royal and british it be enough for british actor to play an english queen or king to get nominated it seem for example helena bonham get nominate here be just ridiculous she be good of course but nothing deserve an oscar nomination the film be well make and act but be basically lie sentimental and simplistic one at that king edward viii the old brother here be know supporter of hitler but the film do not mention it here king george speech impediment be not really so important because the king role be pretty limit at the time and his importance be little compare to prime minister churchill in prepare the country for war big deal that he be stutter he could have be mute and it still would not have change much the film also conveniently ignore that king george be not churchill supporter and think his politics of clearly oppose hitler be incorrect instead he show strong support for neville chamberlain politics of appeasement even after chamberlain have cynically approve in munich hitler invasion of czechoslovakia if it be up to king george churchill would not have be appoint pm halifax would have and halifax be just another chamberlain so the film be sentimental lie for naive sentimental public

appeal to emotion bite too much at the first 20 minute of the movie you be in roller coaster of emotion you get emotional you may even cry the problem be after 40 minute you be so over the whole roller coaster after while you be just tire with the way the movie keep try to appeal to you emotion it quite annoy m not even go to attempt to write critic for the end cause it so far reach that nasa voyager 1 whould be jealous have feel the scenario work well with the original korean version do like the cinematography yes do believe aras bulut iynemli be an amazing actor yes do appreciate the work the director make of course not impressed though if you want to watch movie about father with special need watch be sam 2001 and if you want to see movie about person be jail in turkey watch midnight express 1978 would recommend only for the amazing performance of ara and the fabulous cinematography and that it

you let both of us die just to keep your secret this time the razzie get it wrong this movie be no where near as bad as make out to be and be in fact fascinating movie let get the major complaint out of the way first as happen to agree with it if you be go to take role that call for you to be stripper then you damn well well be willing to strip the fact that lohan wasn really detract from the film there that it she be the wrong choice for the role but she really do credible job play dakota moss and be aubrey be just natural for her really enjoyed her performance and could totally see her as this girl with terrible childhood the movie be also well write as neo noirish mystery that have some clue but also do not make sense how could she be the same person how could she not be aubrey when the secret be reveal it should come as surprise it do for me this film be enjoyable and if lohan ever decide to play role for real then she may gain some credibility
a melody of film the first thing that strike you be the haunt back ground melody of r rahman which repeat itself with the fabric fall from the sky and the beauty of the period that be well photograph this movie remind me of merchant ivory production with all blossom english countryside shyam benegal be an ace director who have produce some classic art house film and zubeida be one of them amrish puri be his usual talented self karisma kapoor have give her trademark acting but she will never reach the intensity of act as in rishtey manoj bajpai be good actor who do justice to any character he play this be movie that leave you the feel that you have just read beautiful poetry and you want to read it over and over again
waste of time where to start this be bad film from start to finish 1 the acting be really bad almost everyone be overact almost every character be bad stereotype the scummy cop the over the top mob gangster the white trash single mother the bratty child that doesn want any help etc lastly the southern accent be just plain terrible they be just pure cliché and add to the terrible overact 2 the plot be completely nonsensical why do the police and the fbi who be clearly eager for information about the whereabouts of the body of the senator intimidate 11 o boy by give him the feeling he commit crime this whole situation could ve be resolve by sensible prosecutor ask for the information and offer witness protection case close the mob gangster would never have have the time to react in time they could ve just arrest the blade guy but nah the tommy lee jones character rather take his time to punish kid instead of resolve the senator case all in all waste of time could ve do something well in those 2 hour
go go gadget right out of the theater don think there have be bad film to come around like this since ski patrol want to like it matthew broderick be one of my favorite actor of the 90 but he be undermine by effect some good some pointless and rupert everett claw man only one part of this film be remotely watchable that be the end where there be seminar for bad guy include the metal mouth from the james bond film and mr i reccomend that part to movie buff but thats it if you be really interested though just watch the cartoon version which be at least reccomended for kid among the bad of the year unfortunately
i be stun by other comment this movie be bore well must say be disappoint we be wait very much this movie since cannes and when you walk out of the theater your reaction be it be just that this movie have visual beauty for sure but it be without soul lack point of view it not bad film just not solve film the acting well for those who want oscar forget it immediately the technical aspect only art direction and score be not bad wladyslaw spillman must be turn in his grave
promise but poor script and lack of action make it disappointing after the event of zombie massacre 2013 you would imagine that this film would be sequel you be mistake this film be not even prequel zombie massacre 2 reich of the dead 2015 detail an independent story set in wwii small group of american soldier find shelter in an apparently abandon building as they try to call for help we know that thing be go to get bad and the film do good job of keep the tension go be wait for zombie to appear at any moment but the tension continue and continue and continue and continue when you get to the first zombie action you ve already watched third of the movie this be not bad but the zombie encounter be disappoint disappoint enough that you label this movie stall and you be correct the film be really stall in the film set assume that zombie knowledge be not common thing still it seem that the story try to explore the concept that bite will turn you into zombie which think doesn make sense for the time portray in the film the performance be acceptable but it be still weak the story as whole do not present anything interest the end try to make everything mysterious and sinister but think it be too confuse would not recommend this film to any ordinary viewer just for fan of zombie movie
an absurd movie the movie be fun through the first confrontation which be on bus but become suspicious because the hero be outnumber 5 1 then it get bad at the second home invasion and ridiculous at the final confrontation there might have be third confrontation between the second home invasion and the final confrontation but forget oh and there be silly car chase the hero car be wallpaper with bullet but he be unscathed
escape from shawshank it be the most basic of all principle of film make story of redemption this time the story be set inside shawshank prison where successful banker andy dufresne tim robbins be send to during the 40s after be falsely accuse of murder his wife and her lover the jail veteran red morgan freeman see andy be force through the front gate of the jail on his first day of arrival and see him as weakling red even make bet with the fellow inmates that he win last he wrong andy do last and become an inspiration to all of those behind bar the warden of the jail samuel norton bob gunton be intent on bring down andy and his defiant nature as all villain always be that be the prevailing message suppose the redemption come two fold andy be give time to reflect upon his life in shawshank and red who be obviously deeply move by andy influence learn thing or two go through cleanse process we see the gradual change too first red be the cynical veteran then the curious insider then the close friend then the surprised object of redemption as strange title it may be the shawshank redemption be worthy one at the end of the day shawshank be good film but far from perfect one m not interested in respond to its top 250 placement with my review as countless others have do but the fact that it have be vote into the number one slot be reflection of how universal its appeal be it about as likable and mass market as possible there nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn take enough change to potentially polarize audience it play it safe and in my opinion bit too safe the film message of hope and redemption be way too heavy hand the outcome be movie that be very simple and easy to digest but not really very interesting beyond its surface it speak volume that so many people who have go through depression often reference this as one of the aid they use for comfort it a movie that pat people on the back and give them hope and inspiration that a great message but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience and instead just spoon fee it well for me anyway it doesn leave much of an impact it just well make but manipulative and self important film 6
an embarrassment this be not spoiler there be nothing to spoil have rarely give film such low score and be one who enjoy the subject of space travel and good sci fi be shake that any part of this film be nominate for an oscar be disappoint at the high score of reader on imdb in my mind it create cloud on all future high rating by any measure except special effect even those be not that spectacular this film be failure if you enjoy watch thing fly around and sandra bullock grunt and gasp for an hour and half by all mean watch it dialogue what little there be be insipid plot be preposterous can only imagine nasa worker laugh and roll their eye anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking take my advice don waste 90 minute of your life you can say you weren warn

medicore or m just dumb sunset boulevard be good movie this isn a lazy observation or lazy review it be good the space between mediocre film and great film it story be intrigue but be drag on the line be deliver well but the write itself be mediocre sunset boulevard be one of the most famous black and white film be bit of disappointment for me it felt like normal film to me it didn stand up to what hear about it it be just movie maybe there be deep underlie tone that didn understand due to my simple knowledge of film but felt nothing still the character be intrigue especially the two woman but the main character itself be view by me as normal man maybe that be the cool part of him do not know feel like this movie have something great under its face if m too dumb to understand it m the dumb one but for normal guy like me this be nothing but normal old film
a slap in the face the movie be slap in the face to the 150 million native american who die so place call hollywood could appear and make it possible for people to make movie that be slap in the face to 150 million native american where be their movie where be ludlow massacre picture the emma goldman story you want fair account of mr watch reflection of evil love the part where he visit schindler list the ride at disney world where be movie that doesn portray all middle easterner as hateful terrorist what about this for movie how the russian win world war ii and bail out the ally would watch it schindler list be good movie but it fall way short of be great feel for single person who die in conflict or in anyway for that matter but it be time to talk about the death people be unaware of the holocaust be horrible display of how disgusting human nature can be but want it to be someone else turn to tell their story of pain and suffering to the world we will always mourn those fall behind so lets educate people about the dark secret of our country beginning or make movie about how our government actually use troop against it own people the ludlow massacre let move on
flat let see where to start this be movie base on bad cartoon it flat to be frank pointless phone in plot and hideous visual effect dan akroyd try to pay tribute to the original voice for yogi bear but ultimately come off as annoying and voice act with little substance try to watch this movie from kid point of view but even then felt the filmmaker be disrespect me by make me watch the same story and dialog ve see hundred time before trust me could ve write well script this film doesn know its audience and therefor spread its humor too thin wait minute what humor tire theme of corporate greed and the lovable loser try to get the girl be do and be so boring this review doesn contain spoiler because the plot be so predictable everyone can see the spoiler come from mile away
visually stanning visual and picture of this movie be the best one
all the best bit be in the trailer m go to make this short the movie drag on lot script be pretty dull special effect weren as good as promised acting be okay dev patel stand out as the best casting decision my problem be that could never get into the mystic of this story have never watch the animated cartoon series it be half boring half nerdy there be hot princess which be good eye candy for the time be but honestly mr shyamalan really drop the ball on this with his new picture devil come out don have high hope for this director success anymore
great idea terrible execution have no problem with heist movie feature an all female cast but this be just terribly do didn believe any of the eight be actually good at their job unlike the original movie they didn bother spending time to make you believe the plot be super loose and felt randomly throw together there be also just too many celebrity cameo and they take you out of the movie it be an amusing movie but wouldn waste any money on it wait few year to catch rerun on cable
what film grip story with beautiful shot and direction of master himself story that take you to the lane of past and force you to feel that pain and go through their journey that the beauty of cinema love it everything be look so good whether act music sound cinematography edit everything be so fantastic specially the color and how they use the contrast of that red blazer to show the authenticity and pain of those people the helplessness of those there be some of the most true and graphic scene here ever capture on celluloid people be shoot for no particular reason hiding in fear strip and gas abuse so much so that viewer watch it for the 1st time will be deeply affected
they clearly run out of idea after two season the first two season and the season 3 premiere be incredible it be sci fi with fart joke and somehow that 39 an amazing combo however season 3 be horrible and season 4 be off to an awful start somehow all of the sci fi aspect be go and everything have be replace with action and violence 39 not against those thing but that 39 the most simplistic form of entertainment and quite frankly if be look for that 39 look for good version of it than this as it be have hard time watch these episode now but somehow feel obligate to do so because buy them my advice watch season 1 and 2 and pretend that it end there because it 39 just get stupid and mindless
bore except form some scene apart from some big action sequence this be like the second pretty boring film really don dig the stupid stuff about the oracle and the architect sorry like the first installment and they should have leave it at that
very strange indeed from time to time in small piece manage to finish the 2005 pride and prejudice be no expert of jane austen nor of the english regency period but still can be quite disappointed by this adaption compare to the very impressive liz by jennifer ehle whom already deem as an idol keira knightley be far lack of beauty and charm can not stand her grimace and grin which frequently happen and make such an exhibition of liz mr darcy be very unconvincing and many other character such mr bennet mr colins be also very strangely depict the only merit might be the color and the scene but that can hardly help still prefer simpler and lighter color for such an movie after all if liz be fail the movie be fail can not help sing praise again for the 1995 bbc version not only liz and darcy every other character be so vividly present especially would mention mr colins because his every scene amuse or disgust me so much that start very harsh criticism on greasy man of his kind to my friend for half an hour then realise what an art it be for the actor to achieve such an effect in comparison the 2005 mr colins be unfortunately very dull and empty and can not be understood or connect to any real character in life have be very cruel but can not be milder after the 1995 p which really bring the novel to life
most boring movie ve see in long time my god this be boring film two hour and 20 minute that seem more like six hour there be way too much talk interwoven plot line that make little sense and paucity of any kind of action until the very end as for political statement that the government should be afraid of the people instead of the other way around fine blow up parliament but don take so freakin long to do it if have be alone would have walk out before it be half over as it turn out my companion would have join me but we both end up suffer how do anyone sit down and watch the final cut of movie as bad as this and say to themselves this be it it good to go be bore natalie portman unconvincing as the girl who fall in love with the mystery man behind the mask and what be all that about the letter write on toilet paper probably just wasn pay attention d take my glass off long before that since really didn care what be go on bad movie on bad movie
didn read the book but ugh if you be go to make movie about child be force to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the line of shindler list or at least tone of some satirical value and you would think that the angst fear disgust and overall awfulness for the main character would be focal point you would think the blood lust of the watching mass would form visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as backdrop to all of this and most of all you would think that child even child raise to expect that they might someday have to enter tournament like this would struggle with conflict between fear innocence longing for some sense of decency and try to sort through the confusion to survive it be something of stretch to imagine society in which everyone love see child murder each other that in itself be plot line the brings distort feel with it the movie try to hide that or at least neglect to even attempt to address that by layer this movie in and american idol feeling there be no sense of outrage there be hardly whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the character they be wooden and whitewash the most we get in the way of sense of their overarching dilemma be few shallow feeling comment and silent look of stoic concern the movie seem to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we be watch child kill each other it be as though we be watch run man only with 8 year old who doesn want to watch movie where adorable little boy and girl snap each other neck or dog run them down and eat them alive if movie like this be to be do it can not avoid the moral content without seem shallow and absently deprave that be this movie the core be not attempt it be like red tail meet run man find it absent vapid and obviously lack in any real value it be also little sick because it didn even bother for tone whilst present the viewer with mind bend plot in short wooden act shallow presentation and not at all smart
bore disappoint tired to see wolverine powerless not much to say just want to see wolverine kick buts guess m too old now and m tire to see all my cool stuff from my youth dead or deform m glad that didn spend dime in this crap
gotten suspect foul play after learn of his brother death ruthless gangster return home to find those responsible in this iconic british crime drama star michael caine the film be credit as thriller on imdb but it be little too leisurely pace for that to ring true there be very little sense of urgency to caine quest to avenge his brother death but this be not necessarily bad thing if anything get carter be refreshingly different sort of revenge movie with limited action and dislikeable main character whose only noticeable human quality be his dedication to his family there be also an interesting dynamic at hand with caine acknowledge that he be the bad one and that if either of them should be dead by now it should be him for all its uniqueness get carter be not however the easy film to watch there be quite few dull patch throughout and it be only so interesting to follow character with relatively few positive quality the film additionally throw so many support character into the mix that upon first view at least it be sometimes hard to keep track of who be who the scattered memorable moment of the film be however very very memorable these include an explicit phone sex session with constant cut to caine landlady rock back and forth in her chair as well as scene in which caine force two men out of his room at gunpoint and in the nude the sombre end be also pitch perfect caine and director mike hodges would collaborate on the equally uneven and yet still worthwhile pulp one year later
if could rate high would the writer producer of this film clearly have the most intriguing imagination feel honour to feel the warm glow of hope that be portray in this film don want to give too much away as it a film you need to see to believe it absolutely excellent

the red headed step child of the series this films function far well as predictor of the terrible prequels than as sequel of the first two film several factor the ewoks be the l of it work to make this film exceptionally weak it adhere too closely to repeat new hope ala beowulf the incest be retroactively add to empire do not help worse the film be split into distinct section that don function as story overall this film be really two story the rescue of han and death star 2 0 neither one be give proper to time breath and they don gel together nonetheless the core of the film be solid luke arch be bring to satisfactory close and the various character be give proper send offs even the final battle be rather serviceable despite the repeat from new hope this bring the first set of film to proper end this film be the most damage by the special edition all of the added material weaken the material and add noooooo to critical moment be so artless that it nearly destroy the entire climax and thus story
don fall for the hype this film serve as perfect testimony to just how far the current superhero obsession have run amok into completely asinine territory deadpool be arguably the most despicable character ever to have be pass off as hero aside from this fact all of the hoopla from the fan boys say that this be an edgy film couldn be more wrong throwing vulgar language into the dialogue doesn make for an edgy film but it do make for film that be phony try hard at the end of the day this film follow the exact same formula as any other contrived superhero film regardless of what the hype surround it might say this level of self congratulation attempt to pass itself off as clever be offensive to any viewer who be smart enough to see what go on don fall for it this film isn nearly as smart or witty as it think it be
utter lameness it just so typical of dumb ass on the imdb to overrate this tired badly write piece of nonsense the overuse of bad explanatory speech dialogue combine with its simplistic didacticism really grate the film offer cheesy crash course in political subversion rebellion for cretins the love story be irrelevant sentimental and completely uniteresting because the charcterisation be so lame princess amrilla character be nothing more subtle than the pretty scar girlie who grow political conscience and bit of courage the direction and edit be hackneyed dull and predictable the photography be stunningly flat and badly frame just bore take the shot of the english people watch telly it be like particularly tedious kodak moment from family album
blade runner all style no substance an exercise in graphic design movie that want to speak to the human condition but choose to do so by avoid all thing human there light and costume and set design to burn but all the actor have be forbid to act one cardinal rule have be adhere to show no emotion in the future it rain all the time and we ve all become automaton sheesh would somebody mind write movie for this trailer
i so glad it didn suck let me just say have my doubt the last couple of season of the simpson have be lackluster at best and genuinely think that their chance to make great simpson film pass roughly 10 year ago boy be wrong be huge simpson nerd and it be my privilege to say that the simpson movie belongs in the very small group of classic simpson episodes bart the daredevil mr plow etc very funny and very timely great animation and some nice cameo really don want to give any spoiler so ll just say if you re simpson fan you will love this movie and if you agree that the simpson lose their edge you will be pleasantly surprise as be 8 5 10
a really fun film but have some messy story point really do enjoy this movie much like the first film it still have the wit and charm to it that make it really fun to watch it be very innocent and cute too all the cast member give it there all in make this film come together and help to create more satisfying experience but this film have major fault in its plot there be thing in it that don make lot of sense especially when the investigation come together it be very messy and doesn make once of sense understand that this be film about talk bear so there be some suspension of disbelief that need to be have but when your plot be be focus on that part of the film need to make some sense now this doesn change my love for the film at all just really want to give this movie 10 and have find cause of this one mistake it make really can not now still though the film have very funny and entertain villain that be very eccentric that like and some of the prisoner be very good too overall the paddington sequel be very great add on to the franchise
as boring as it can get the film be dull boring and slow no character be able to convey any emotion at all we can hardly hear marion cotillard when she speak she be one of my favourite actress but she disgust me in this role emil orlando who be call pivotal be as interesting as dead oyster and the quarrel between him and his cousin bruno be extremely weak borderlining ridiculousness and neither do it help to keep the audience interested neither make phoenix character sense and it be hardly believable be afraid but this film be absolutely unnecessary with highly foreseeable plot setting and costume be the only acceptable part of the film and carusso singing in ellis island be the only moment when felt certain emotion not recommend it to anyone and be sorry for anyone that spend his money in such heartless and spiritless film we be force to write ten line on review film but be find hard to have much more to say

the most boring movie for 2015 under zero emotion the story suppose to be great but it wasn that drama be not drama but just some piece of story that this director try to join by force and to give meaning during its way most of the big trouble be that camera that never stop shake and zoom in and out and move up and down with no sense even in the most quiet portrait there be no need to play with move camera in senseless way to make the story more dramatic big disappoint even in some character there not professional pretending would ask to this director to give me back the time spend to watch his bullshit and maybe to tell to him how he can do this movie in more positive way
the movie didn make me cry but the movie make me feel sad goodbye with the pursuit of the perfect dream in the first time saw this movie poster in the cinema near my house didn want to watch it much but after hear the news that this movie get many academy award and many golden globe award want to watch it until netflix thailand put this movie have watch it and love it very much like the first scene that all of the cast singing another day of the son the choreography of the cast be perfect someone in the crowd be also perfect love the color of the dress and the emotion of the cast and the scene that like the most be the end like that write in the heading this scene didn make me cry but this scene make me feel sad goodbye with the pursuit of the perfect dream
an interesting hitchcockian style thriller must for thriller completist fan of demornay this thriller be receive poorly on it release this be unfortunate as found much to like here firstly like the main musical score run throughout the film and the director be quite clearly go for hitchcockian feel which only partially succeed though the chemistry between the lead be excellent and the scene contain both demornay and banderas be the strong and most watchable have to say do not think harry dean stanton put too much effort into his part as he be not all that convince and dennis miller be just plain irritate len cariou be okay as demornay father but really the two lead be the main focus and the main reason to watch this the love scene although bit lengthy be stylishly make and do not detract from the film the end although bit of stretch be at least surprising and act fairly convincingly although be no shrink so although be far from classic certainly think it be far from be the bad thriller would rate it above the meg ryan effort in the cut ashley judd twist along with sandra bullock murder by number to name few
i still don get it people sure love this movie have friend who say that it 39 good because of the ear slice scene most director would cut away from such violence entirely but here we get to see the aftermath of maim well yeah quot reservoir dog quot do push the envelope but towards what should we really praise movie just because it wallow in violence more willingly than its predecessor br br my ex girlfriend say this be greek tragedy if that be true the violence would be entirely justified because it would help elevate quot reservior dog quot to the level of an enlighten commentary on human nature alas none of the character be particularly noble they start off as low life and have nowhere to fall so that defense doesn 39 seem to work either br br in short people have long try to convince me that this be really masterpiece but even the best part such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant seem artificial and engineered tarantino be rip off old good film and director wholesale there be shade of quot the taking of pelham 123 quot here and there 39 also dash of quot the omen quot at the end hitchcock frankenheimer and even john carpenter do this kind of stuff before and they do it well no doubt tarantino be breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movie but he be not much of an innovator and don 39 think that his super cool style have stand even the short test of time he have after all practically drop off the face of the earth
bleak neo noir con artist here refer to as grifter be popular character type in film this be somewhat logical as film make itself be something of con like any mark the viewer have to react certain way for the scheme plot to work the major difference between the grifter and other film about con artist be the lack of regular mark every major character in the film be grifter and each one always seem to have some plan to manipulate the others while simultaneously maintain state of hyper vigilance to avoid become victim himself this mean that the viewer be also hyper vigilant and always expect some complicate scheme to suddenly fall into place the great part of this film be that this never happen the fact be that none of these people really have big plan instead they all just distrust each other and steadily become miserable even though they ought to be comfort each other especially since two of the three main character be blood relative what we re leave with be one of the dark of all neo noirs ultimately the film manage to shock the viewer because the expected deus ex machina experience that tie everything together in neatly arrange package of destiny fulfillment and narrative closure isn only absent but altogether unformed because the world of this film be one rule by the chaos of chance the film be also impeccable from technical standpoint the visuals be carry off really well and the acting be spot on
magical and whimsical filmmaking this be fabulous film in so many respect it all start with that spectacular opening and there be so many memorable scene throughout with the now iconic night time scene above the city of star that adorn the film poster particular highlight ryan gosling and emma stone be just perfect add to that great score wonderful cinematography and sublime end and it all amount to one of the best and most original movie of the last 10 year that seem to get good with every viewing

really mediocre movie go in expect knockout of horror movie with bit of humor in it accord to the description and some word of mouth review barely make it through the entire movie really bad write directing and act although like the two lead it be nothing good than mid range episode of twilight zone or outer limit the comedy fell just as flat as the story for me it come off as completely force not funny at all
subtle genuinely creepy and subtle the others be very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint in an era where you can only impress young horror fanatic with bucket load of blood and gross out effect amenábar actually re teach his audience that fear be especially cause by suggestion and the absence of explicit image the others be the first intelligent horror film in year completely rely on atmosphere and eerie set piece it such relief to finally see subtle film that be also effective m normally not much of nicole kidman fan but she very convince as the prudish over concerned mother who desperately try to protect her child from the outside world daylight in particular she live in remote mansion and wait along with her 2 child for wwii to be over with the arrival of 3 servant strange event star to occur in the old house and the daughter spot intruder everywhere the screenplay by amenábar himself be not totally unique filmfreaks who re familiar with expressionism highlight from the 60 will quickly guess the hidden plot twist but it fill with ingenious finding and sublime dialogue the others remind you of the innocent and there be far bad film to get compare with if you ask me what also be rather amaze about this production be that amenábar seem so confident this be his first giant hollywood adventure with star in the cast and american money and yet he have total control over everything the acting be great the plot actually scar you and the directing be solid the others be total winner and easily one of the great genre film of the last few decade

a genre picture but satisfy one tim robbins play andy dufresne man convict of double murder who be send to jail eventually befriend other lifer include morgan freeman elli redding exceptionally handsome adaptation of stephen king short story rita hayworth and shawshank redemption in the film version it really raquel welch not rita who aid in the ultimate twist on the surface it another prison genre picture with the usual stereotype such as rotten warden cruel guard few homosexual and quirky old timer who doesn want his parole however the film emotion run surprisingly deep justice be well serve by the conclusion and several of the cast member carve out amazing three dimensional characterization the finale be pure fantasy however it do provide the audience with the release it need and robbins and freeman be excellent long involved but engross and satisfy shawshank be not big hit at the box office but find devote follow on video and cable 1 2 from 6
i find it mostly non believable pointless and confuse mostly find this movie non believable pointless and confuse didn find it really predictable but most people probably will the acting be ok but not great zooey deschanel be the only bright spot in my opinion benjamin bratt appear in the movie and be adequate katie holmes be suppose to be the star think found her sub par as usual don really like her that much and have yet to see he in good movie or rather have yet to see her put in good performance in movie the end be something most people will probably see come mile away it not something predict but it wasn surprising either my vote for abandon be 4 10

a batman of shakesperean proportion dark yes complex ambitious christopher nolan and his co writer jonathan nolan deserve stand ovation don usually go for loud movie fill with mindless gore and violence the dark knight be certainly loud and violent but it not mindless it have depth and soul even the joker in an extraordinary creation by heath ledger be deeply human the natural petulance of christian bale make his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes part of the genius of this movie be that batman himself in screen time be not really the lead my attention be captivate by heath ledger and he determine and inspire the breathtaking atmosphere that envelop gotham as well as us the aplomb of christopher nolan as director be mind blow and his secret believe be his obvious respect for his audience what he do be to elevate popular genre into shakesperean proportion bravo
the problem isn the film it you you know what the problem be you expect all the wrong thing from the wrong place you yearn mindless action when it give you profundity you expect hapless simplicity when it give you intellectual complexity and you expect to be spoon fed when it want you to ponder do not let expectation rule your decision this isn a film for the meagre mind who expect to clap their cymbal in harmony with some of the drivel that be show on today silver screen if it be your heart felt opinion that the avenger deserve an oscar then don bother watch this film birdman be heavily nuanced yet eloquent visual art form it be different and it require the audience to flow with the unconventional rhythm of the film rather than expect rigid logic and conventional storytelling we be allow to explore the character purlieu while empathise with his inner mediocrity it aim to express the level of malaise one experience when he fail to achieve what he feel he deserve the film may not answer all the question it create but that the beauty of it watch it without petty expectation and appreciate it for what it be cinematic ballet an experience however not everyone can comprehend it the thing be if you think that it beyond you as to why this film be so critically acclaim then it probably be and there might be problem while it certainly not the film
should be rename the zac bagans show use to really love this show but you can tell that it have become all about zac as the main host find it shock that he stears clear of all the solitary experiment he also talk over the other 3 host on the show the best thing they could do be walk away from zac and start their own show well do nick for have the courage to do this zac you really have become wannabe and fake learn from your mistake before it to late

this be an opinion review walk into the cinema expect to write something about this be the must see film for the weekend remember the nostalgia of the original and the progressively worse but still kinda cool sequel except for that abortion tokyo drift we all like to forget we saw and the redeem previous installment fast five that somehow redeem and reinvent the franchise introduce the rock as kick as anti hero and start the franchise on remarkably cool path with fast pace action that be ground with great balance of realism and plausible suspension of belief what walk away with be have my mind rap by the bad script censor it be near impossible to believe this be the same writer and director duo from fast five but then they be also responsible for tokyo drift firstly for some reason they have drop all of the iconic moment that we have come to love and expect there be no action pack opening scene fill with car chase and metal carnage instead we be treat to be tease with quick race where nothing happen and show the aftermath of what must ve be an incredible heist and then when we eventually do get to see some car chase scenes we quickly realize that they have also do away with those camera shots that weave in and out of the car put you in the center of the action go be the great balance of realism and plausible suspension of belief and instead furious 6 be write with absolutely no regard to physic or common sense it one thing to have car flip over by drive head first into them with ramp attach to the car its another thing entirely to have bobby keep pace with super fast custom f1 type of thing and almost overtake it but that small compare to the crap they actually come up with for this movie think super fast chase scene with tank oxymoronic and people fly through the air superman style like neo catch damsel in distress mid air after be flung from m just gon na stop there have your eye rap spoiler free but don blame me for the loss of reason skill as you re try to forget to think all together just so you can soak up the visual aspect of this redonculous spectacle it actually infuriate to watch movie with some cool bit while realize the absurdity of what you be expect to swallow at one point there this huge cargo plane land on runway but keep cruise so it can take off again and this 20min action scene develop with car drive into the cargo hold of the plane and fight erupt everywhere in the plane around the plane and it never run out of runway for over 20 minute now call me crazy but at some point everyone in the cinema turn to each other and say this be ridiculous we all as unit get up and refuse to have our intelligence mock while expect to sit through this crap and we burn the place to the ground here some math typical airliner cruise at about 160mph for takeoff 160 60 20 53 3 mile long runway the best thing about the movie be the fighting between the female character that probably because they cast mma star gina carano opposite michelle rodriguez will this be one of those movie you love to hate or be it simply too mind numbingly
incredible movie don get the people give low than 7 star rating and nag about plot hole and the end it a movie that require lot of think since everything represent something even saw one review that say how do they know that the platform be not reach the ceiling at the top floor it could kill them well of course the platform cant bang on the ceiling since someone have to place the buffet there what the point of platform banging on the freaking ceiling after that it a representation you can interpret this movie literally everything be an allegory please read some review here that have the interpretation of every character and scene you will immediately think wow it will be really helpful wish it be serie that could watch everyday really interesting movie definitely recommend it

highly overrate to me chinatown be mediocre film noir love mistery love dark film and love tragic ending but this film contain nothing of these the only real surprise of the movie be the fact that salt water be not good for grass all other twist and there be many be either hint at too early in too obvious way or they come completely unprepared in way which be mean to shock which usually fail this hold in particular for the daughter sister scene on one hand hand expect her to say something horrible on the other hand have no clue what exactly she will say so be neither surprised for have no expectation which could be shake nor shock because the scene and its aim to shock have be herald far too early the end be logical and would be nice if gittes wouldn have talk to much before so chinatown be already know as the symbol of we destroy what we love while try to protect it and we can only wait and see how exactly destruction will take place the film be somewhat save by the superb acting of whole cast nice lighting and the nose scene alltogether 4
not so good can see why certain ppl would like this movie but ve be watch it myself for several year now it just not for me think it cheesy just not funny apart from the creepy scene with the young mom hit on her future son there a huge plot hole ve notice for many year why wouldn his adult parent remember that their son look identical to the kid from both their past it a dumb movie make for certain group of ppl
awful script with very nice view poor character clich story terrible dialogue feel like waste 2 hour of my good time guess cinema fan find it really hard to not like michael caine and harvey keitel especially when they be this old and look very wise sagelike guess everybody have similar expectancy when it be movie about old age and youth and life it have to have some wisdom and the film try to fulfill this poorly it be full of one phrase self help wisdom more apt for twitter than for work of art dialogue like when you be young everything seem so close look through the telescope that be the future when you be old everything seem far look through the other side of the telescope that be the past it doesn even make any sense and the movie be full of this most of the dialogue be either that or just pure nonsense sound very wise at first and when you think about it minute it total bull yes michael caine can make scene come alive but there be no real character development apart from some very worn cliche like the unattached musician who can relate to the world do music because music doesn need word just emotion don understand the world understand music and there be no development to his desicions he make and the change he go through but after all he be an actor and doesn make difference how good be and actor if the story be non story and all the support character they don support the story there be maradona obviously stay at the hotel and he have quite long scene don see what he have to do with anything but even the more complex character like the movie star stay at the hotel doesn support the story just come in blurts out some self help wisdom and go out same as the miss universe that come in say she love robot movie and turn into psychoanalyst in 20 second and blurts out some more self help and out she go only to come back to expose her entire body naked some minute later actually think of give it 4 out of 10 just out of respect for the very good acting but then again wouldn recommend it to anyone except to give an example of bad dialogue writing and still it would be waste of time
deep thinking at its best sci fi thriller and philosophical commentary this movie take you to the darker and deep corner of the human soul must see of spanish cinema
surprising film be give free advance screen ticket to see this film and be the film buff that be take them and go and saw it have see trailer before hand and know what to expect from the film but get ta be honest my expectation be low and the only reason watch it be cause they be free ticket now after see it can tell you the film be an awesome surprise the cast be great the action fun and the plot unique didn see any of the twist come and find the film to be very entertain it doesn get too convolute at any point and be great chase illusion film it like funner version of the prestige not that the two belong in the same class just an easy way to quickly summarize what the movie be try to accomplish although michael caine be in both film go see it as will again fun summer movie that be likely to surprise more than few people with its plot and twist

cheap thrill just to be clear believe first blood to be an absolute classic follow by the enjoyable popcorn flick sequel br br this film however play on some very deep and dark theme with all the finesse of drunk orangutan fire machine gun on full auto purely as cheap setup for grotesque final act for rambo to dish out his flavour of sadistic home alone fantasy br br an altogether unnecessary film which have more in common with horror film saw amp hostel than it do with any classic action franchise br br let 39 hope sly stop before release rambo geriatric blood
forever favorite of mine will never forget the first time watch aladdin be with group of friend wait in the airport for the plane that would take us from orlando to paris at the time when aladdin be the big thing in the usa while some preview of the lion king be start to screen aladdin will forever be associate to that wonderful week spend in disneyland and it only fit if the movie be my favorite disney film slightly edge out the jungle book know can get all rational in this review analyze what make aladdin such an appealing film and use the expected word of disney renaissance and comparison with the glorious best picture nominee predecessor can also talk about the animation the music the extraordinary multi vocal performance of robin williams as genie but don feel like get rational love the film for personal reason that be essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre adolescent life aladdin take forever cherished place as one of the last treasure that enrich my childhood even play pivotal role in the way would start enjoy cartoon kid day in the usa be the motto of the week that be celebrate the 65th birthday of mickey mouse and for kid who never travel outside his country go to disneyland be the most unexpected destination the most extraordinary trip would never have dare to dream of this be when discovered aladdin through the prince ali fanfare endlessly perform during the parade through the film image air on tv something be strangely attract me to the film and guess the fact that know the story help lot grow up with french cartoon from 1969 titled aladin and the magic lamp record in an 80 videocassette movie can recite and sing by heart and there be also an obscure manga aladdin film we watch at school before the summer holiday needless to say be already familiar with the story and see it translate into disney language be something be excite to see would they talk about aladdin decease father mustapha would he live with his mother what kind of role would genie play well one thing matter apart from these question know the story and could understand the film even if didn speak english at that time it wouldn have help me anyway because the airport be very noisy so just sit on my luggage eat some candy and could understand who be who and what be everyone scheme obviously aladdin want to be prince to marry the princess and jafar to marry the princess to become the prince and between them the genie would come to fulfill their dream so saw the film and love it and for one year before would see it again the music of pince ali and whole new world be the musical remembrance of that magical week in disney world and when saw it again it take another dimension finally understand the subtlety of the story learn all the song after repetitive viewing and for month and month be transport by the prince ali parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic whole new world and its beautiful opening when jasmine jump on the carpet and the zoom out rajah look small and small watching from the balcony saw the film so many time during my pre teen year that would never forget the first sensation it immerse me into with an unexpected awkward one must confess that jasmine be one of my first movie crush and my idea of the ideal woman as kid don know why but the way she look during the love at first sight moment hypnotize me and the moment where always melt occurs in the carpet ride when aladdin give her the apple when you understand that she understand who the prince ali be there be no word to describe how incredibly sexy she look at that very moment the crush didn last of course and as grow old and be disappoint with the return of jafar sequel and the tv series my interest for aladdin decline and it be reduce to kid stuff use to like and then 10 year later as student saw the film again on my computer eat pizza and something magical happen when the whole new world music start during the closing credit my heart be inundate by nostalgic torrent so immense that couldn stop cry because it remind me of the privileged place the movie occupy once in my heart the magic be back and whenever be spend good time with friend we be have fun listen to these old disney song and the clip of whole new world be must see and how glad be to discover that wasn the only one who like jasmine feel so concern by this film and so deeply attach to it that don want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic review the film be just thrill romantic adventurous and feature certainly the great cast of support character without it be the counterpart of dull hero or heroine there not single minute of the film that seem pointless and waste and certainly not with character like genie that the best could do to rationally explain my love for aladdin but maybe because love film can also depend on external factor that influence your judgment in the case of aladdin everything contribute to make this my favorite disney film for sentimental reason yes but who ever say they be wrong
this film will make you into goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus predator be hilarious for all the wrong reason and love it well say love it but it more like like it quite bite it full of stupid cheesy one liner that be endlessly quotable my favourite be the one reference in my summary just due to it pure randomness laugh lot more than perhaps the film want you to and think that the entire movie be actually pretty bad but for all the right reason arnold swarzenegger be as good an actor as he ever be but he carry this film well base upon his action rather than word the action be what you come to see though and it all pretty good john mctiernan expertly direct the film keep up the pace and make the predator believable and compel villain indeed the special effect be very good too and didn once see the predator as just man in suit look this be by no mean masterpiece however can see why it have such cult follow like so many of swarzenegger 80s flick it wasn the best film ve see wasn the bad wasn even all that engage but it be entertain and give me good laugh or two 7 10
not bad worth the watch yes it can be little corny but it a classic and make for people that want to learn self defense ok maybe wax on wax off doesn really help much but it be an amazing way to learn karate paint the fence however maybe not the karate teacher be psychopath and the student be the follower make ralph machio who be in his early twenty at the time feel as if he go near the girlfriend he would pay there aren many character except the love intrest his mother the teacher the bully not many good movie with the watch classic 80s film
incredibly wooden act from the rock this film will make you wish the time would go faster
rather watch paint dry wot can say to this waste of time nonsense film myself and my husband thought we would treat our kid to nice kid 3d film only to find there be no 3d except for burger fly out of the screen during the trailer ha ha oh yea forget there be few moment when fly make split second 3d appearance the storyline be irritate and boring and total insult to the rep of the star in it end up gain half stone with frequent trip to the food counter out of boredom while my husband and child endure the rubbish before them come on disney get grip m surprise that we be expect to pay for this rubbish we should have be pay to endure it for god sake
zombeavers well as soon as saw zombeavers advertise on another crappy dvd have purchase knew have to watch it the storyline be predictable the same as most low budget mutate animal film but these be my favourite kind of movie right from the off you can tell that the film isn take itself seriously which be exactly how these sort of film should be make the acting be okay ish not the bad have see by far the dialogue be actually not that bad either which make change the effect be my absolute favourite part of this film they be mainly puppet and they do not heavily rely on irritatingly bad cgi there be nothing more annoying for me than film with creature effect that look like cartoon anaconda 3 or over use of the same cgi scene just flip around megashark v giant octopus so this film take it back to the old school horror love monster movie love zombie movie and this really have the best of both world although really didn care for any of the character because ofc they make stupid decision really enjoy watch how this film play out weirdly absolutely do not guess where this film be go it be well worth watch if you fancy gory giggle enjoy x
not the simpson grow up with ll be honest don think any of the reviewer that have give this movie 10 star have see any episode of the show pre 2000 go into the movie thinking it would probably be decent figure it would probably be in the style of the newer episode but with good overall material that pretty much how it turn out anyone who say it be return to the old good simpson be kid themselves the simpson greatness be base in my opinion on two thing character that we imagine exist in our society think the comic book guy moe flanders and simply hilarious and very quotable line this formula have since be replace by humor that be situationally base and quite frankly just not very funny saw this movie yesterday afternoon and can hardly think of one line that have me crack up there be some funny moment yes but nothing comparable to the brilliant one liner from the show glory year
a visual masterpiece and good than the first so the journey continue with the lord of the ring the two tower this review will assume you have see the first film the fellowship of the ring which be fine because peter jackson at the helm of this massive production assumes you have see it as well intelligently jackson do not begin with redundant and unnecessary prologue he dive right into what the filmmaker consider the hard of the trilogy to make when we leave the fellowship they be in shamble gandalf have fall merry and pippen be kidnap by the evil force aragorn legolas and gimli seek their small comrade without the help of boromir who have also die this leave frodo and sam on their way to mount doom the one ring still in their grasp the two tower be more successful than fellowship because the storytelling becomes more complex without drown us in information the first film introduce us to the many character of middle earth too many believe the two tower isn quite as concerned with exposition though new character do come on board merry and pippin meet treebeard large talk tree herder who be concern about the plight of his forest future since the destructive orcs and their master sauron and saruman burn everything in their path legolas aragorn and gimli enter the kingdom of rohan and cross path with king theoden and his people theoden have be under saruman spell as part of he and sauron master plan to take over the separate kingdom of middle earth eowyn the king niece develop special like for aragorn however as we understand from the first film there be still deep love between aragorn and the elf arwen along with the rest of the elf of middle earth arwen be persuade to leave for another world entirely she do have reservation leave her true love aragorn though mortal and she be not for distant land and never see him again frodo and sam be introduce to the mysterious gollum who attempt to attack the hobbit in their sleep to regain the ring instead gollum and frodo kindle special relationship since they both harbor certain addiction to the ring power frodo elijah wood be the most effective actor in two tower as he be gradually take more and more over by the ring and it awesome strength gollum become frodo and sam guide to mordor as he have be there before gollum intention though be never clear to the hobbit neither be they to gollum these three strand of story form massive thoroughly effective epic tale of nature vs machine creature vs creature and through frodo man v himself the encompass story lead to heroic battle sequence fight on two front while all the time we wonder how long frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly take power over him the pacing which be an issue with fellowship be not problematic at all the second time around the three story be tell in manner that flow right through the three hour tale one problem that persist be that two tower be largely unaffected by the humanity other than frodo saga there be love between aragorn and arwen eowyn also show up as romantic character her father theoden be courageous man but flaw psychologically there exist connection between these many character and more but they all feel half bake and cast aside to make more room for fight still the two tower be enormously successful as narrative and even more ambitious than fellowship visually the score by howard shore be among the very best ever compose the evil orcs and uruk hai never look fake and evoke terror in the character and in the audience still yearn for more personal story but in other realm of film make peter jackson and those under his command have outdo themselves 5 out of
not quite incredible but certainly still good make when pixar really be at their absolute peak this be an entertaining film that manage to find that hallow ground of appeal to both kid and adult it a smartly write film with some good vocal work from people like holly hunter and samuel jackson some of the animation at time be breath take too it a bit long though which may put some young child off and the plot be stretch out little too on the whole though this be quality entertainment from the era where every pixar film be winner
unwatchable this movie direct by an amateur have horrible soundtrack you only will find pleasing when you never have the chance to develop taste the super star you love from fury road have boyish haircut that make her even more unlikable than miss limb and baldness one of the opening scene be her charlize theron buddy bet on her be able to name the ingredient of piece of pastry she eat who care not me do it do something for the plot story or character development of course not there be no meaningful dialogue either nothing make the viewer want to find out why these people have wolverine healing power here be tip for make scene believable when crew of mercenary get shoot down in an ambush and start move again in room full of enemy one will notice and lot of gory head shoot would ensue not melee dominate by wonky pseudo martial art which unfortunately be depict not even an extra star due to production value for this hot garbage
bore think the high rating stem from the unique character that be create like darth vader and luke skywalker the special effect be good especially for it time back in 1977 this movie be revolutionary and change the industry however what remain when you strip this movie of it special effect and science fiction setting be basic plot that be do thousand of time it very predictable and boring be 26 year old and one of the few people who never saw star war everyone say it be good so when come across it on vhs three year ago decide to give it try man be disappointed it nearly put me to sleep don i ll watch another star war movie again
may be bad superhero movie ever simply dreadful travesty to the entire men series vicious and violent it have zero redeeming quality nothing more need say but 5 line be require so repeat simply dreadful film travesty to the entire men series vicious and violent it have zero redeeming quality nothing more need say
too generic to hold your interest the series have no identity of its own it feel like every series out there with the added disadvantage of poor writing and serious pace issue additionally the focus on the equaliser family drama which be the weak element of the original 80s series drag it down both in term of pacing and make it feel like every other modern series personally m not go to bother with this slight offering but if others get something out of it then good luck to them be however sceptical of all of the glowing review
not film to watch for the first time when you re 30 miss out be 4 year old when child play be release and remember see trailer for the vhs release in videotape we rent which be obviously more child friendly since become horror fan during my late teen simply miss out on the authentic experience of chucky mischief today with terrify puppet as see in film like the conjuring annabel and dead silence the fear of puppet and doll have be take to extreme level however one must consider the fact that in 1988 the entire concept have be fairly new and people around the world have be terrify with the concept of kid doll possess by psychopath serial killer and target their them or their child watch this in 2016 after couple hundred other horror feature must say felt like be watch comedy horror which be one of my least favorite genre chucky be not scary he ridiculous the acting might have be consider superb during the late 80 but be unauthentic and unconvincing in today standard much respect to alex vincent play andy for star in film at the age of 7 but his performance make suspension of disbelief impossible all can say be that child play be an excellent film for child who be not young and timid enough to become paranoid and prevent the house from sleep at night 2 month after watch anyone else would find it amusingly ridiculous at best
really bad before this film be release new line say we hope to beat titanic john rhys davy say this be go to be the big film ever ian mckellan say cry the first time saw it you will too as the box office and the wave of indifference prof they couldn have be more wrong perhaps the arrogance of the film maker be one reason why so many people don like this film perhaps that why it hasn break into the top 50 of the all time adjust for inflation chart me be just bore to tear the story be very very simple group of character have to take magic ring to special place where it can be destroy along the way they run away from some monster then they run away from some more and this keep happen right up until the end only there be no end the film just stops which of course be cheap market ploy to make you see the next two the script be awful it like water down shakespeare and some line be such nonsense that there be few groan in the cinema saw this in it also have total lack of humor which make it all the more pretentious the character be never flesh out and some of them take on charachatures gandalf be the bad of them all caricature of merlin from the king arthur story he be so 2d he could have be create by walt disney the direction be average to say the least and it seem that peter jackson have no real style of his own instead he borrow heavily from the like of tim burton sleepy hollow the action scene be very poorly do and so be the use of cgi wish could talk about the score but really don remember it the acting be reasonable enough but some of them must have think what be do here when they have to read such banal line overall it be just really bad movie never live up to the hype and to be honest never come close no matter how much the cast and crew tell you how great this be the simple fact be it not 3 out of 10
longmire set the bar yellowstone shimmy under it limbo style unwatchable for me yellowstone be fill with gratuitous violence cringe worthy portrayal of native american caricature instead of role show real human the acting be good but even this fine cast can fix lousy screenwriting longmire spoil me it set the bar very high but yellowstone do the limbo flat on the ground instead of try to match or exceed it
the bad film have ever see never think d be this rile up by one movie but be the director take story with an interesting premise and turn it into the most boring and nonsensical feature film as much as respect the actor in this have no idea why such talented actor would look at this script and think hm think this be something that go to boost my reputation as nice as it be to see glasgow in it glory it seem like over an hour of the film screen time be award to thing that didn even matter nor effect the film in any way for instance shot of an eyeball doesn have to take 5 minute of our time then of course there the pointless accomplice appear for 25 of the movie doesn say anything doesn really do anything the film wouldn have lose anything spectacular if he wasn in it if you re plan on go to see this don waste your time you gain more excitement from watch paint dry
watch something else many fan be go to this mess of film and probably enjoy it me and my wife go and after about 90 minute begin to play mystery science theatre 3000 my other reviews mention the costume drama she drag me to this movie be payback please understand that have not read the graphic novel yet my comment will be brief on behalf of movie that may have be true to the graphic novel but seem to have lose sense of strong narrative somewhere around 90 minute that first 90 minute feature some strong direction with plenty of movie reference from wellesian shot to several kubrick influence clockwork orange and dr strangelove will put turn point during the flashback when dr manhattan reveal his past this section be perhaps my major motivation for see the movie it use philip glass koyanisquatsi as its score it be good series of scene but how it contribute to the narrative be unclear to me it go on and on and at some point choir be add over glass music do glass know his music be be alter the film have issue with stupid sex scene stupid music during stupid sex scene violence that seem put in the movie for the sake of violence and some character that become as enjoyable to watch as malcolm macdonald caligula my major criticism be that more skill wasn use to craft narrative similar to how jackson adapt the lord of the ring at 2 40 in length hope for either payoff in the story similar to the dark knight or at least great cast that keep the movie enjoyable like potc at world end neither be to be have but my major what be be you think come from the soundtrack choice dylan the time they be changin simon and garfunkel sound of silence hendrix watchtower maybe that one should slide boy it nice to see the film use music from the 80 and such original choice uhhhg that go as well for the high brow stuff like glass koyanisquatsi from uh koyanisquatsi or wagner ride of valkeries for the watchman fight in vietnam too close reference to apocalypse now use of it but the bad be at the end when mozart requiem pop in for 30 second oh come on if snyder want to really pay homage to kubrick maybe he should have study clockwork orange 2001 and the shining well for their use of preexist classical music in the end if the viewer ignore the poorly direct violence poor music corny music and tangential story line there be compel story of hero who more closely resemble villain and the conflict of good and evil within person if you don want to ignore these choice just watch the dark knight again
dark western clint eastwood both directs and star in this academy award win best picture and director film western feature eastwood as age reform gunfighter will munny lure out of retirement to collect much need bounty on the group of cowboy who cut up prostitute he enlist the aid of friend ned logan play by morgan freeman to help him track them down which lead to the town lead by corrupt sheriff little bill play by gene hackman who also win an oscar an amiable but ruthless man who resent these gunfighters in his town and will stop at nothing not even murder to get his way prompt violent showdown on rainy night superb acting and script here and work as tribute to clint mentor director sergio leone though this sometimes ponderous and overlong film doesn measure up to their famous man with no name trilogy still it be well do and memorable otherwise with haunt finale
unfortunately not good as expect arrival and incendies both of which be direct by dennis villeneuve be movie love very much both movie contain satisfy cinematography and profound storytelling by different context incendies be base on true story of the war brutality and villeneuve catch strike narration which make feel the reality in our
sit at the back some bad act from certain actor some very good from others lot of jump but that what these thing be about plenty of really awful hand hold zoom cinematography that make it look cheap and amateur why do director want to fill the screen with lot of out of focus stuff and then deliberately shake it around to blur it even more so from me this enjoyable though brainless flick lose 2 point for it equipment abuse lot of plot hole if you sit and think about it but just sit back way back if you don want to throw up in your popcorn and enjoy the slasher ride
a prison story that will leave you want think have never see this movie before and then happen upon it on tv then realize be require to see this movie in public school in which zone out with boredom basically it a campy forest gump like story of prison with the common trope of rape and racism but nothing like real prison for most people mean who go to prison and get cushy office job it okay for generic movie but as prison story you will be leave want in fact here be few reason to see different movie 1 the escape plan it silly and simple make you think the prison be run by complete idiot escape from alcatraz with clint eastwood be much well 2 the final escape pretty anti climatic just finally happen and then movie be basically over once again go see escape from alcatraz if you re expect extensive tunnel swimming or something that make you feel like the prisoner earn their freedom 3 if you want prison story about that best capture the essence of the desire to be free watch papillon it roughly base on the french penal colony system during ww2 and numerous escape attempt 3
get sore but at the theatre movie clearly can understand how you think this movie be excellent good ok but have to hand out 2 rating because too many people give it 10 without think the story line be lame the length make this movie seem like you be wait for the 3rd show 3 year from release date to come out the battle scene be lame be wait for 1 5 hour for something to happen set up the plot the character my but look at this movie as waste of time almost walk out of the theatre and in turn will watch the next two on my big screen at home where can pause these boaring movie with lame actor but cool effect that be willing to sit threw and see something interesting because the movie world be in need of new 1 movie don pick this one it like read the table of content in magazine but have it 50 page long

the lie woman appear in new world it new york in the 20s that should be rife with possibility she have the address of relative where she go to live she could get job marry leave the misery behind but showman arrange to take her in as part of his cabaret show she doesn know this but be little by little swept in as we be into sex despair drama the question be about the extent of the manipulation in this world be the custom officer bribe to report false address be the sister sick as report but we see everything in the same passive yellow light the filmmaking itself be unimaginative but more the filmmaker isn try to sculpt possibility only arrange the story that will take us into his show how much more bold and difficult it would be to have the woman herself manipulate actively try to carve her own fate be the incident on the ship during the voyage really lie and would we judge her if it wasn and if we do would we be any different from the bigot uncle but see for the filmmaker this win be an important lesson unless she just stand there pure toss about as two rival men watch her and scheme for her and we watch them and there only postcard importance between the level of watch
ignore the review make up your own mind almost didn see this in the theater due to all the bad review what change my mind be roger ebert give it rare positive review since agree with ebert more than most critic decide to go see it have to say that none of the review or comment ve read tell the whole picture imho neither ebert praise nor other critic pan be entirely appropriate let start with the basic the mummy be modern retelling of 30 b monster movie with up to date fx it wasn great drama but it be rouse thrill ride that capably do its job of entertain you if you weren too picky about plot etc the two sequel have continue this tradition d rate this as inferior to the original but slightly superior to the mummy return much have be make about the casting of maria bello in the role originate by rachel weisz while m not rachel weisz fanboy she be very capable actress and just don believe m bello be up to the role there be simply no chemistry between bello and brendan fraser there be basically only two legitimate reason to make sequel 1 either there be loose end to tie up or 2 people really like the character and want to see more of them each film in the mummy franchise tie up its own loose end so the producer be risk commercial suicide to change the character in any significant way if they couldn get rachel weisz they should have be much more careful in recast the role there very little physical resemblance between the two actress and m bello simply doesn seem to have the act chop to carry it off that unfortunate casting choice cast pall over the whole enterprise but not enough to sink it some have criticize the film because they don believe that brendan fraser look old enough to have son luke ford age that arguable all of the holdover cast be start to show their age especially john hannah but again it not deal breaker otoh the secondary role be excellent michelle yeoh and isabella leong be excellent while jet li give another great performance as the evil emperor luke ford be somewhat bland though and doesn appear to be good candidate to carry the franchise into the future the cgi fx be generally excellent but nothing we haven see in the first two film the exception to this be the yeti with only few minute of screen time they pretty much steal every scene they re in where the fx do seem lacking be in imagination scale and scope when compare to the previous two film perhaps that because more of the action in the previous film take place in dark claustrophobic setting while here many of them be in brightly lit sunlight the battle scene in particular suffer in the inevitable comparison to the lord of the ring trilogy be this film make principally to milk the franchise almost certainly but then so be the mummy return but that doesn mean it fail on its own term it be entertain and supply much of the same appeal as its predecessor if you can watch it on those term and if maria bello cast isn too disappointing to you then go see it you may have good time do
flat dull stupid can only guess at the age and experience of those who in other review of this movie have dub it the best movie ever viewer be forewarn it isn not by long shot what it be comic genre film and like most film version of dark comic it be enslave to rain and shadow candlelight and eyeliner aesthetic pseudo intellectualism and faux poetic moment it suffer greatly from an unbelievable premise murderous super bad guy run wild in the street do their will and mind numbingly dense dialog watch this movie just recently for the first time and have to check all the background material on it because just couldn believe it be actually shoot in the ninety it be an eighties movie in every way shape and form hearken back to the day of the early cure bauhaus souxsie and the banshee etc the acting be flat all around brandon lee spend the entire movie with his chin on his chest glare menacingly from underneath his furrow brow and what little there be of character be two dimensional comic book view of the world juvenile and meaningless try desperately to be deep if brandon lee hadn die during production this film would be regard as nothing more than an amusing goth fantasy and not the goth cult classic it seem to have become guess understand some people emotional attachment to it but back when be be goth and under the influence of nihilist aesthetic my friend and read baudelaire sartre and dostoevsky to us film like this would be as intellectually an emotionally fulfilling as the popcorn you might eat while watch it the best movie ever sorry no
one of cronenberg best and most accessible film cronenberg adaptation of wagner and locke graphic novel place simple american family man and his all american family into new and disturb context which have them question everything they think they know tom stall viggo mortensen own little diner in small town and have nice house on the outskirt of town where he and his wife edie maria bello raise their two kid apparently live the american dream in their own way one day at the diner two murderer pop by at closing time for some cherry pie and tom heroic defense of his diner his customer and himself set off series of event that threaten his family his sanity and his life the eerie tension never let up in this powerful examination of identity honesty and violence david cronenberg have direct some of my favorite off beat film the masterpiece naked lunch scanner videodrome have watch these film many time and still find them interest can really call myself fan however because there be also just as many cronenberg film out there which find difficult to get through the first time crash existenz dead ringer cronenberg enjoy create disturb situation and imagery and want to get under your skin and to stimulate your mind on as many level as he can in most case he pull it off masterfully but sometimes his emphasis on the bizarre can come across as pretentious and force like lot of very creative and intelligent people cronenberg sometimes leave his signature virtually everywhere in his work and sometimes director need to make film which do everything they want to accomplish but leave off the signature for example the brilliant david lynch show us his ability to jump out of his own skin with elephant man and the straight story these be still very much lynch film but they also appeal to the wide audience of mainstream cinema goer history of violence be in some way cronenberg most straightforward film key to its success be that it be very easy to forget that you be watch cronenberg film no matter how aware you be of cronenberg many quirk idiosyncrasy and trademark it be so masterfully direct that although the plot be not entirely unpredictable you be right there in the action with the character and feel what they feel so that though you may know what next you never exactly see it come and you never know how it will take you there viggo mortensen in his best mainstream role since aragorn and maria bello one of the actor who make the cooler worth watch head an impressive cast in this adaptation of wagner and locke graphic novel nobody in the cast slip up at all the script be intense realistic and probably do nothing to make the performance easy the plot if describe without the plot and the context create by the script would seem somewhat absurd but like woody allen match point it absurdity do not make it impossible to believe edit direct and pure performance combine to make flawless performance for this cast back up by veteran ed harris and william hurt and very strongly support by the excellent maria bello mortensen be shockingly excellent in difficult role can explain why without give too much of the film away although the rest of the cast do exactly as they be suppose to want to single out ashton holmes an actor be completely unfamiliar with but who will look out for in the future recommend history of violence highly it be one of my top five reason for consider 2005 to have be great year in north american film
the most amazing film ve ever see when be 2 year old my favorite character be morla because he so big and huge love the music because it be so naturest my favorite song from the movie be bastian happy flight because listen to it all the time my favorite actor from the movie be noah hathaway happy birthday tami stronach the childlike empress be so cute wish this movie be play at my high school that m go to real soon ll might play morla when this turn into play at my high school think everyone should watch this movie enjoy this movie for movie night
one of the best movie ll never watch twice the revenant fall into the same category as aronofsky requiem for dream and spielberg schindler list for me in the essence of be terrific movie but not something think can sit through second time in all these movie there be brutal sequence that cause emotional stress and disgust just watch because it be so real and grip to think that event in these movie actually happen or that they could very well happen be too much for me to think about not to say that do not enjoy this film thoroughly the revenant be technical masterpiece that leave me wonder how the hell do they do that after many scene and sequence with beautiful cinematography and adroit camera movement this film be visual magnum opus it be apparent that the great mind that put forth this film be none other than the same one that bring us birdman lubezki and inarritu there be many long shot without cut that be sprinkle throughout the film that add sense of sophistication to it with the added bonus of predominantly location base shooting and natural lighting for the film that can even make novice film watcher raise an eyebrow at its complexity the camera work be not the only noteworthy aspect of the film the actor do superb job execute their roll many be rave about dicaprio performance but be more of fan of hardy brutal and gritty character fitzgerald grant half the word that come out of his mouth be unintelligible but he leave no doubt in my mind that he be fully devote to his role and bring fitzgerald alive instead of just hardy play character name fitzgerald he be simply amaze with all this say there be still flaw in the film at some point it be drag on and move too slow it give the impression that the film itself be cocky and want to show off all of its beautiful scenery and camera work too much then there be the he shouldn be alive situation hugh glass be real guy that really do survive bear maul but in the film they make this guy practically immortal there be too many instance where be think he should be dead three time over right now for me to enjoy the film as much should have all in all great film that only recommend to season and mature film viewer
political identity fair game be film direct by doug liman the bourne identity mr and mr smith base on the memoir fair game my life as spy my betrayal by the white house by valerie plame sean penn be back after take two year act break since his second best acting oscar for milk in 2008 he play the character of politician joe wilson alongside naomi watts portrayal of cia agent valerie plame together these two tell the true story behind the weapon of mass destruction scare in 2002 and 2003 in iraq that ultimately lead the united state to war valerie plame be in the middle of the investigation of wmd in iraq in order to learn more about the possible wmd the government have valerie husband joe travel as an ambassador to niger in order to get information about the sale of uranium from niger to iraq joe learn that there be not go to be sale but the government twist the story after view the state of the union address joe wilson decide to write an article in the new york time state the truth behind what he find in niger challenge the white house directly in response the government declassifies valerie status as cia agent make her fair game and put her directly in the public eye in order to bring shame to her husband and her family this spark fire within joe to fight the white house but also begin to tear him and his wife apart fair game allow naomi watt and sean penn to let loose and take over the screen with their acting talent watts doe very good job with her role portrayal of hard shell valerie plame she be able to create the stubborn exterior of plame while show her emotional side deep within congratulation be in order for her be able to stand out while on screen with hollywood superstar and academy favorite sean penn all of the talk about the film have be direct towards watts as oscar season approach but it would be no surprise if penn receive an oscar birth as well he be phenomenal in the film create very unique character break through the clichés that could have be both of these actor be able to give the film heart and show the strength that the couple have in order to fight the corrupt government sector lead to the fall of scooter libby the film be slow to start as the back story be build however while the character of valerie plame and joe wilson be develop completely all of the other character seem to be leave behind they come off as just walk through the motion make it very hard to connect and differentiate between them this can be attribute to one of two thing either the acting be less than adequate or there be so many character that watts interacts with at the cia it be hard to put name with any of the face fair game be political thriller that need to be make however it be your job as the audience to reach out and see it because of its limited film release go see it now in order to learn about the story and note that best picture oscar nomination may be wait for this dark horse of this year award season
entertain but shallow this be one of those film like quite bit the first time but didn think that much of it on the second viewing guess enough of it be just good for one look maybe it be the immature attitude that prevail throughout the film that wear thin but be not go to knock the movie it entertain and definitely worth look if you have not see it if you like car and chase scene s worth multiple look in fact the car chase scene at the end be one of the best you ll ever see nice soundtrack in here too and pretty good cast with nicholas cage lead the way the bad news well here yet another case of hollywood make bad guy into hero we re suppose to root for people that steal car hello
good 70 drive in fun pretty much typical 1970 drive in feature with cute girl cool car good music and some nudity foxy girl uncle get sick so she get her hot girlfriend to help her run his gas station in half cut shirt and short short the station start do well so naturally the mob run gas station across the street doesn like this at all and hijinks ensue if you enjoy these kind of film this one be worth watch not much humor but the acting be good than most these type of film and its very watchable gas be 79 cent gallon in this film which along with the girl and the car really make me long for the 70
sleazy 70 gangster classic watch this recently as it be well know british classic thriller as with lot of these old film make in 71 the sound quality wasn great that slightly spoil my enjoyment of the film if be to choose soundtrack that complement film perfectly would choose the get carter theme the tune open the film with solo play on harpsichord think which evoke sense of disaffection and then in the film we arrive by train at industrial wasteland that be newcastle in the 1970 also bass guitar be play groovy riff in background and that be after we have witness in the film gangster enjoy porn film the music set up the film perfectly it have be while since watch this film it certainly remind me of classic 70s tv programme like the sweeney and play for today gritty sleazy and with aftertaste of poverty look back at it though it quite straightforward revenge flick there isn much character development for michael caine as carter but he be still good in quiet reserve performance one surprise for me be that the film star the famous english playwright john osborne as one of the northern gangster cyril he be famous for write play such as look back in anger there be northern twist to this film with the backdrop of austerity in newcastle play against the rich london gangster hand full of pound note and drink beer out of straight glass this bring an added interest to the film really think the setting of the film be one of the most enjoyable part of it and alongside the haunting music really capture your interest more than it would in another location if you want to recapture life in britain in the 1970 you will love this movie and it have some of the best british actor in it like caine and ian hendry the film start fairly positively for carter and then descend gradually into hell as he seek more and more revenge in the end there be no good guy leave include carter give it 6 10 because felt it could have develop the character back story bit more but it be one of those film that stay in your head long after the film end
episode splendid performance actor well organize and very creative very entertaining indeed
stereotypical generic war movie whole movie be make of three thing talk scene between mate to get the viewer to know the character well and get attach to them action scene moral dilemma between what be acceptable in war and what be not to make this film deep
awful be an overstatement after cinematic excellence such as avatar and inception here come movie that put hollywood to shame dare say this movie be an utter waste of money and time let start with the mixture of real life character and animation it be an absolute embarrassment to the movie maker to even think of such concept the blend of both world do not do any justice to the movie nor would it to any other movie in the future let assume the target audience be only child the least they could do be to let the movie be in full animation megamind come as good example the joke on the other hand be boring child do not find any of the joke funny what else us adults the cinema be in complete silence during the funny scene and many even walk out form the cinema comedy might be tough genre to tackle however look at find nemo they definitely do great job in entertain the audience the only reason why this movie might do average in the box office would solely be relate to the curiosity and hop moviegoer have spread the word do not waste your time and money on this this movie be truly slob and showcased how the people responsible be only interested in make quick buck without be bother about quality what next the adventure of daffy duck
nostalgia can save this movie remember watch this film as kid in 1984 and love it remember discuss my favorite scene with friend and classmate cherrish those memory and that time period in my life so decide to rewatch the never end story today in 2021 bail out after about 40 minute into the film the boy read the book be annoy and in one scene he scream out loud like girl for no apparent reason the acting be hammy and most of the dialog be cheesy some of my favorite film from my childhood be timeless classic that still hold up today and can watch them anytime like ghostbusters the karate kid star war ect sadly the neverending story isn one of them

overrate watch this film mean have try to watch it but after the first hour heaven could not go any further and have to leave the theatre really over over overrated yes the actor be fantastic love them but the story be not well tell it unfold so slowly and come on another film about the hard life of an actor actress in los angeles
mornay sauce rebecca de mornay can be fascinate beautiful actress but as for the part she give to play if you can not say something nice de mornay portrays woman who have terrible trauma as child with father she can hardly stand now that she a grow up and have become of course brilliant shrink she have an affair with banderas whom we suspect of be ouch how original serial killer sometimes she recall banderas mother in law tippi hedren character in marnie but wouldn count on it hitchcock die twenty four year ago and lot of regent desperately try to replace him here the director pull out all the stop to make thriller with an unexpected end but that end be so far fetched it be absolutely impossible to buy it the movie include the obligatory conversation with serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murder human being and cat split personality and open end in case the crowd should call for more apparently they do not and they be right
what the point it isn funny frankly do not understand why the big lebowski have be elevate to the point of be consider one of the best cult classic of all time why this cult around the character of the dude one of the bland flavorless most uninteresting comedy protagonist ever to be put on celluloid he simply some dopey hippie who love to hang around john goodman cardboard cutout vietnam vet go loco real vet should raise their fist in anger over such an overdone unfunny disrespectful and insulting characterization and seldomly see steve buscemi who doesn really do much the plot wind into so many different twist and turn and include so many support character all of whom seek the dude bag of money that try to understand this movie be like try to untangle the gordian knot by hand what the point of place layer upon layer upon layer of weird uninteresting character to the point that you forget what the hell this movie be about nihilist german rocker some sicko hugh hefner clone gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant garde artist who want to have the dude baby strange drugstore cowboy who serve as some sort of greek chorus stop it pee wee big adventure have an array of weird character but it succeed because it have straightforward plot and brilliant acting and write the coen monstrosity have little wit or sign of superb comic writing and all of their character though weird be totally boring and flavorless for weird character to work they must act totally off the wall and twisted beyond realism the weirdo in lebowski be actually regular and seem like mish mash of all too real reject from yuppie coffee bar who like this stuff have just see no country for old men and like lebowski that be poorly write in term of smooth plot and like lebowski lack any interesting character ll give fargo chance otherwise the coen brother ain reel me in with their weird clunky movie
i like black panther but didn like this movie really have high expectation go in maybe too high but at some point think the black panther be in the fast and the furious and then some typical heist movie ok m be harsh and didn hate it just didn like it kinda blah and all the talk about marvel first black superhero but as far as movie go let not forget blade have see blade few time and think like it good little bloody but like snipe in that role he nail it you know what maybe m just suddenly tire of these current hollywood blockbuster
overrate and cliché let me start with the conclusion this movie be overrate and cliché here why first of all the movie use typical american hollywood formula introduction character introduction problem introduction second character sidekick problem solve seem to be get progress plot twist opposition bad guy or whatever get the upper hand main charecter save the day and then the movie end this doesn necessarily have to be problem but this movie basically felt like two long cartoon episode stick together in the past there be several tv show episodes where someone get stick in the realm of the dead on the mexican holiday dia los muertos one can ask how original it still be you combine that with character that aren too interest it even have the typical seemingly useless animal sidekick that play minor role and plot that predictable and one can understand why can possibly consider this movie to be classic don get me wrong though still enjoy this movie somewhat although that be mainly because it of its highly polish animation and the presence of good vibe the music definitely help with that summary not original story typical movie formula bit predicatable highly polished animation good vibe
do not enjoy the film find the change make in the story line show mr jackson do not understand the book at all his his replace the character of glorfindel warrior with arwen lady of the realm turn female warrior for no apparent reason other than to attract xena fan completely destroy the point of the tolkien trilogy he simply can not undo the damage he have do with this substitution significant segment in return of the king hinge on the fact that there be not female warrior be so disappointed in the film and will not be watch any of the following installment just wish mr jackson have bother to read the book before he butcher them
garden flower zach braff have make it both script directing and main acting and everything be more than all right this be film without violence about people live ordinary extra ordinary life and it much more interesting than extra ordinary murder which very very few even in the usa encounter the hero have be go on tranquilizer for all his grow up life and even before that he get no feeling leave not even for the death of his mother then he meet girl well act indeed by natalie portman who unlock him slowly say the right thing all the time without know it hour after you ve see this you realize that here be crucial moment this be turn point and so on the love story get little sentimental at the end but still this be film that live long after you ve see it through
great setting and imagination but the movie yesterday go to go see oblivion thought be go to see more and in some way do but in some do not the setting in this movie be phenomenal and it have well act then expect it really hit heart in the end but honestly think this movie be to slow way to long little boring and 100 confuse toward the end start to take guess at when it be go to end their be always perfect spot to end the movie but instead they add on 15 more ongoing minute that waisted my time the end definitely could ve be well although it be very deep it be just how the plot work and how everything be just all over the place you just lose focus and be not able to pay attention as much as want to say love it or even like it all can say be it okay oblivion be fresh new idea that you may like for sci fi fan although be one and do encourage you to see this movie
another stereotype movie as for exception of some good character spoof the obvious clone of american pie but not so straight another gay movie be as its title say another gay movie that it seem try to laugh about different circumstance what happen to gay people since teenager to old or at least that the kind of life that be put in our eye and that be not good thing the plot be not novelty if you have see the american pie film the difference here be that the entire world be gay now if you note the continuity here as in american pie you can watch that some scene be exactly in its base the same thing the character here be four guy one lead andy wilson michael carbonaro one nerd griff mitch norris one straight like jarod jonathan chase and effeminate one nico jonah blechman as understand he work too in luster film of everett lewis the guy want bring and in spite they don want to accept it receive in sex they want their first time and more when fluffer the experimented lesbian ashlie atkinson give to them the lesson of success the other character can be easily note quickly the closet bisexual father of andy his mommie dearest that be funny the sexual fantasy of andy his teacher surprise to see graham norton here bonnie nico mom angel striptease teacher who be in loved of griff and the guy want to have sex with jarod this be at least the most important character for the movie and be at the same time good proof of how the gay stereotype in movie go on in middle of social message of equality and respect for gay people im sure that this be gay movie make of gay people or at least part of it and be surprising but this movie could be come kind of funny but at the same time hope that be not my impression but see it so offensive if we can call that follow the same tradition of scary movie and obviously of the another movie kind start think by not another teen movie the spoof here work too with the dirty thing mixed then with the american pie gag but here and that be the problem of american pie too be that the character sexuality be humiliate in different funny way now the problem that have another gay movie be that think go to far thing that american pie doesn commits and for bad be not message of tolerance at all just for the stereotype well know that the scary movie count with this silly some time dirty joke classic of spoof that be develop thanks for airplane the difference be that at least scary movie concern be about scary movie then we can say that the concern of another gay movie be about gay movie but don see it the point first of all horror genre have different mark through movie history and scary movie want to spoof all that error that have in it ilogicity of its plot or its character gay movie be base in real people who deserve respect as the rest now the scary movie althoug there some good horror spoof like pandemonium or high anxiety or even the gay spoof creatires from the pink lagoon could work well as many others spoof scary movie very well airplane spoof accident film as the naked gun series do with cop movie thats very fine this movie could spoof the different gay movie but when you see it its clear that don obviously the plot be define by the gay stereotype sincerely don think that be thing of proud so another gay movie be great acceptance comedy just because be like american pie straight one well then at least for me make something different the thing be that they picture the gay world most important thing be beauty and sex unfortunately this be point that at least this movie get because it true but be not another reason to laugh for the rest different exaggerate sexual issue coprophilia and air of pedophilia and zoophilia be the content of the joke and for last the boys dream in his first time we witness almost everything even just for note double penetration so this be funny movie anyway the joke oh come on be just joke this be not serious film yes of course then the thing of value and respect for difference be just joke too isn another gay movie show to us that at least be show to us that gay world then be not so gay as it seem and this could be good thing just if the film never want to laugh with this thats it another gay movie teach me that teach us that hot guy like for example that muscle and hot stud call matthew rush as guess gay porn star that appear in lot of falcon gay porn movie damn that be hot guy dance in the classic gay music but you hear it talk and it seem to hear that kind of vanity guy who only care about sex their penis size and how their love to give and bring at least that be thing that another gay movie teach me and that be thing that probably go to remember anytime watch one of those falcon video sorry for the mistake well if there any
overhyped don understand the hype this movie get subpar story with okay act not good horror movie at all
decent film bad casting to be sure peep tom have some very good idea in it so good in fact that m amaze that hollywood in it zeal to put every form of serial killer and their act on the screen two or three time over hasn do an update of the film powell be clearly influence by hitchcock theme someone actually discuss scopophilia here pronounce scoptophilia in peep tom instead of simply depict it and style unfortunately the overall production be just not up to the task the plot be little too heavy hand and literal at time the character somewhat cartoonish and the pacing leaden really the big flaw with the film be the casting of carl boehm in the roll of mark look somewhat like the offspring of joseph cotton and peter lorre in one of late night with conan brien if they mat routine boehm play crazy all right that the problem though that all he do at no point do believe that mark be capable of hold down not one but two job perhaps the british standard of creep out your fellow employee be different from ours here in the state but the first time mark lock eye on me while mumble in that high lispy vaguely accented voice of his d be on the phone with human resource like that what make norman bates such compelling character be that he do have the ability to function in society from time to time he can be charm friendly and even funny when he want to be mark however be incapable of any of these quality his timidity be so pronounced that it hard to believe he could ever screw up the courage to actually kill someone because that would require human interaction and the idea that anyone even someone as apparently oblivious as or with the appallingly low standard of helen could actually fall in love with someone mark be hard to accept marion definitely sympathize with norman but it be pity sort of sympathy she sense there something not quite right about norman and because of that at no point can she ever feel romantic attraction toward him norman be irreversibly derange and without hope peep tom on the other hand seem to suggest that mark can lead normal life and perhaps even have girlfriend if he just stop his habit of kill woman
most disappointing movie ever as die hard simpson fan felt very disappointed with the feature film debut from the great sitcom ever the simpson movie never reach the height of its tv counterpart the first 22 minute or so be right up there with there with above average to good episode of the great sitcom ever the joke in first 22 minute be abundant and intelligent the laugh really begin to dry up when the hideous story take shape and we be leave with environmentalist crap where homer small silo of pig poop and his own poop contaminate the already massively polluted lake springfield to the point where the schwarzenegger lead government put massive dome over the town of springfield for good twenty minute the film be largely laugh less the theater be also the movie do not really recover and rarely muster more than few chuckle the denouement be less than impressive by simpson standard the extensive cast character be relegate to background and bite player at best many favorite be absent or leave little to say and do the writer take more easy out than we see in the bad episode and the movie itself play it safe little too often the movie be seem to be more dumbed down version of the show yet there be still much to recommend about the show we all love so much and for so long the character retain their depth and truth the tone be consistent with the current episode which may be part of the problem for some the story and the lack of big laugh be the movie great fault the simpson movie which run long than 3 episode be not even as funny 3 bad episode but it be funny my 3 least favorite episode it be great that albert brook put be another funny appearance though rus cargill be not nearly as funny as hank scorpio or even jacques the bowling alley gigolo the movie disappoint on many level be must see for any longtime simpson fan not the funny movie ever nor the bad movie ever not even close but as one of the big simpson fan in the world for me it be the most disappointing movie ever
don think so just watch this not very good start out ok russell crowe christmas light handcuff possible broken nose on nice babe in car let go but then the plot take over put the spoiler warning on because of the broken nose thing now think about it her nose really be break but why you will find out the question to ask be if this be good movie about the endemic corruption of the los angeles police force in the 1950 or bad movie about the same thing opt for the latter it really be pretty funny movie not in good way though and it long now have no problem with long movie love 1900 but with this movie the first 2 hour be just painful setup for the dumb end it kinda like naked city on valium
good and bad well know the movie would not be the same as the comic book be sure even alan moore and david lloyd would have make change have as many year of perspective as they have on the comic think by bring in different writer much of the plot lose its deeper meaning and irony think some of the content of the comic making it worthy of be make into movie be completely leave out instead content be once again fill with action scene and special effect also some of the non british actor could have use little more practice on their accent overall it be good movie with good act but think the end didn stay true to the comic
entertain at time but be all over the place bird of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one harley quinn be movie have high hope for but it fell flat will start off this review with the positive aspect first such as margot robbie as harley quinn be great casting and continue to be where think she give good performance then her one in suicide squad and ewan mcgregor play decent version of black mask the use of colour and costume think be great and find some moment of entertainment through some of its action sequence however this film have lot of problem most of the performance in this film be very shoddy especially from rosie perez who be walk cliche as renee montoya and know that what they be go for but it just doesn work and mary elizabeth winstead as huntress who give us some very cringey at time act and think some of this have something to do with the screenplay which also think be average at best the humour that they re go for doesn work at all chuckle maybe once and it be the same for my theatre they also butcher victor zsasz which find extremely disappointing as be look forward to his inclusion in the dceu the way he be portray be nothing like how he be in the comic and it seem like he be just try to be some knock off version of the joker also why be the film title bird of prey this be harley quinn movie just like the trailer the bird of prey be barely in it and when they be they have small glimpse of be cool character but for the most part they be some of the most cliched early 2000 era superhero character have see since that era overall find bird of prey to be disappointment come into this film very optimistic but get let down due to the fact that this film write be just plain bad if margot robbie and ewan mcgregor performance weren as great as what they be with the nice compliment of the character costume it would have be completely boring and cliched garbage
poor movie too long weak act the insider capture my interest from the very first ad saw for it and my friend and the 9 of us that go to see it be die to go we go week after opening and watch it and the entire time sit there think why on earth be this get all the praise of critic and audience russell crowe begin the movie in downtrodden and depressed state so as the movie progress and his life take turn for the bad the empathy which be suppose to be invoke in viewer be merely putrid mixture of boredom and pity the three hour tale leave eight of us ask why we pay hard earn money for it my recommendation wait until it come on v and there absolutely nothing well to do and even then go for walk instead
corny and phony there be few positive thing can say about dirty dance some of the dance sequence be indeed impressive few even have an undeniable erotic tension the actor be generally convince the production value good and the film move along at an agreeably fast pace you re never bore still this film be mostly awful there isn one character that doesn behave like complete stereotype there isn one plot development that you can predict about ten minute before it appear onscreen accord to this film naive extremely corny vision people can change and learn all the basic human value and how to dance like professional within few day at the end after the obligatory apology explanation and confession everybody be happy and everything be solve stuck with predictable by the number script the director make watchable even entertain at time film and swayze with grey have genuine chemistry together and the music be great but this film be so sappy that only the most undemanding viewer can possibly like it really corny
lecture or entertainment m big lefty on the political spectrum but this movie legitimately felt like be be preach to by rag angry socialist on stand mean always think it nice to come away from movie with message but when that message supersede its entertainment value the movie quality be reduce feel like this really apply here

good not great clearly some people disagree with me but while this movie be certainly entertaining didn think it be great it have it moment but all in all ve see well movie the one thing all my friend keep tell me the matrix have great plot think it a sign of the kind of brainless movie be release this day that when any movie with sniffing of plot come out people automatically take it for the next godfather the same thing happen with the sixth sense the plot here be passable but far from excellent there be two part of this movie that be really excellent once be the mind bend special effect which be extremely well do the other be laurence fishburne who be at his best as morpheus the leader of this rag tag group keanu reef do his best no to overact the part but it really fishburne that stand out would recommend it sure be it the great thing ve ever see not by long long shot
too much brooding and head scratch specifically go to see this film because jennifer garner be the star but leave the theater scratch my head garner be the only decent item in the movie she give good performance too bad the rest of the movie didn hold up for once would like to see comic book to movie movie that doesn require the viewer to know all the backstory of the main character before see the first frame we get bit and piece that be just scene show in flashback with no connection with what be go on the story have promise and touch of greatness but the plot hole be just too much to ignore electra be an assassin but we don see how hard she be it would have be nice to see her complete few job before the meat of the film start there be some interesting fight scene like with the sheet but lot of the move and sequence we have see before also as powerful as the bad guy the hand seem their end come too easily after lot of fight it seem all for naught some the camera work be so hurky jerky it be impossible to know what be go on there be too many scene of people star off in the distance either brooding or reflect to me it be dead space just personal note one thing expect in these big budget sfx movie be great one liner you can repeat to all your friend at the water cooler the next day they try to do that in the film but it didn work not that this bad movie and perhaps all the hanging plot point will be clear up in the next film if there be one it be decent rainy day filler
an absolute mess never have any intention of watch this but it show up on netflix and so give it shoot what mess of movie first of all we need to throw out the whole noah fairy tale as it be present in the bible if one be to take the time to look we would see that flood purification myth exist long before the old testament be even think in the writer mind it be all an evolution of thought to try to come to grip with the reason people be the way they be this movie be about guy who for some reason become god darling even though he be so full of ego as to think he know anything he go from be love father to be tyrant and basically an abuser at no time in this film be we privy to god talk to noah he simply decide what the plan be m not talk about the animal thing which be incredibly ludicrous god pretty much stick them on the ark and then put them in kind of suspended animation russell crowe walk around like he be constipate he be so intent on his own version of how thing will be that he turn his back on his family yes he be the provider and the time would make him unapproachable by his wife and child he be the grandson of methuselah where do they pull that out of you know the guy who live 900 and some year good old anthony hopkins and apparently be some sort of conduit to god crowe noah build the ark giant box rather than the stereotypical ship with the little house on top that schoolchildren be use to anyway at some point he get it in his head that his mission be simply to save the animal and he and his family be to die off end the reign of man on earth his daughter in law sort of hermione granger be impregnate after hopkin cure her barrenness so old noah decide that if the baby be daughter he will simply end its life he have also offend his son ham the patron saint of actor by not save young woman he have fall in love with ham spews hatred and have every right to there be also on board stowaway who be really satan who be go to take over the family by kill noah with ham help ham of course to some cultist be think to be the reason for race that be inferior so he be the new cain even though he be confuse and depress the way this all end be so pathetic there be implication that be hard to imagine but then it just silly version of an equally silly story oh didn even mention the rock creature that be punish by god and eventually help noah build the ark if there be even semblance of some sort of classic point here it end when these guy show up thought that the john voight tv miniseries be bad but this one take the cake

how do this clunker get by if amazon picture selector pick this they need to go back to film school 101 and learn what make good picture the only save grace be that the actor give strong performance even though the story be totally unbelievable think felt their shame more than once when they deliver every know cliche know to movie go audience ll bet jeff bridge be red all the way through the bar scene jeff bezos may be the rich man in the world but he good get some people in his film group with more discerning eye or his competitor will force its closing pretty soon maybe this one be why he recently fire one of the top guy in the division
possibly the great romance ve ever see charlie kaufman be very talented screenwriter be john malkovich introduce me to his unique mindset and adaptation blew me away with its creativity but this film be his best eternal sunshine of the spotless mind follow joel man who decide to take medical procedure in order to have his partner clementine erase from his memory after he find out she do the same there have be some great romance film like the before trilogy and my favourite be her but this film just might overtake that film to be the best romantic film ever never have see romance as creative and thought provoking as eternal sunshine of the spotless mind out of all the kaufman film ve see this be the deep this film raise really important question regard love and relationship be it worth it to forget previous relationship entirely just because of the bad moment would you want to forget all the happy memory just because thing get bit ugly later on it these question and so many more philosophical idea that kaufman want us to think about and it tell in such an endearing fashion like spike jonze michel gondry be an extremely talented director to be able to make this film come to life isn easy and gondry manage to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of kaufman script beautifully the way this film be tell be very interest the film narrative go back and forth lot and have multiple surreal moment which be what make this romance unlike any other the character be extremely well realise and the performance to go along with it be excellent eternal sunshine show side of jim carrey which we ve never be expose to we ve all know him for his over the top and comedic personality but he never do role as serious and restrain as joel barish carrey be absolutely superb here and make his character as relatable realistic and human as possible he should have get best actor nomination at least this be his best film along with the truman show kate winslet have never be well her chemistry with carrey be believable to its core and she deserve her best actress nomination the support cast with the like of kirsten dunst mark ruffalo elijah wood and tom wilkinson be also terrific in their role much like her eternal sunshine of the spotless mind will have special place in my heart this film examine love and relationship in beautiful and impassioned manner charlie kaufman without doubt deserve to win the oscar for best screenplay with michel gondry and pierre bismuth it become one of my favourite film and can not recommend it enough

influx of people who don understand different genre of film no character development cheesy soundtrack way over the top depressing and get this one too violent these be just some of the hilariously bad review point make by many people give this flick negative score no character development pretty sure hutch be flesh out hell of lot more than john wick be in his first film his back story be more mysterious he not just hitman like john he actually work for the government as assassin and his father and partner history be not explore at all maybe in sequel you ll get those spoon fed answer you need for the film to be enjoyable the soundtrack be great guess some people don appreciate old music way over the top hmmm okay what do you expect depress guess if you don have any type of dark sense of humor what so ever then yes this film be go to be depress kill fest and you should avoid it speak of kill fests how can anyone complain action film like this be too violent if this genre of film doesn usually interest you why watch it or if it be random pick and you didn know what you be get in for why not turn it off as soon as old bob start the mayhem on the bus no need to moan on here about it its far from perfect film but for what it be and be try to achieve and the enjoyment factor if you like bloody action flick then its worth your time
excellent depress but excellent man can not get this film out of my head it be so rare that movie can affect me the way the pianst do the last movie that do that be casino be really tired when be watch the movie it be almost midnight so be think that ll start watching and ll finish it in the morning do no indeed do not stop watch couldn stop it just want to see what would happen next cry during schindler list sob in this film everything that happen in this film be so sad adrien brody do remarkable job of act in this film would very highly recommend this film especially if you be history buff please think this film should be in the top 10 best film of all time look on the message board you know and some other user comment that didn enjoy this film much they criticize adrien brody performance and say that he be bore and only show emotion that be easy to act please you have get to be kid me this man portray the total feeling of hopelessness be alone be hat one time have an audition in high school like this to see if could improvise and the way imagine this feeling be like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you re the only one leave stand yet on the other team there be 20 big men that be just wait to wack that ball at you adrien couldn have do good job be so frightened for him and cry for him during the whole film while he be one the run roman polanski as the director he himself escape the terror of be prisoner in the holocaust yet he lose his mother and other family member yes m sure this film must have be hard to re create for him but he be probably the only director that could have do this movie as brilliantly as he do he create this story and make it so effective call up my mom and tell her that love her so much because we take so many thing for grant true this isn the 1930 or 40 and we be in america but it still frighten to think that human being be capable of that much hate and be so brutal to another human world war ii be one of the most frightening war in history if you read more about the holocaust you get more into it and you should if you be not interested then watch this film it a must see otherwise how else will we learn from our mistake the pianist be beautiful and extremely dark tale about man and the struggle to survive the end be so powerful and move to know that sometimes one man can make difference in crowd of so many and m not talk about adrien brody character you ll see what mean 10 10
the unsung villain steal the show this movie be definitely for action junky if you enjoy disecting movie look for silly dialogue plot hole or look for inner meaning in movie you might want to skip the rock this movie be 2 hour 15 minute but the action be almost nonstop and the movie move briskly it typical jerry bruckheimer fare include plenty of action an implausible storyline and big star do fine job of act some bruckheimer characteristic event be obvious such as the scene immediately after the car chase where cage stand and the camera rotate around him this be reminescent of similar scene in bad boy another bruckheimer film where martin lawrence and will smith be stand in similar pose with the same rotate camera view also present be the presidential address and accompany slow motion dramatic scene near the end ala armageddon m not say it bad for bruckheimer to reuse his old idea just that if be able to spot them other people probably do as well some of the dialogue be way over the top and tend to get bit macho and silly when mason tell lomax you re between the rock and hard case felt like groan there be plenty of self referential comment such as this one where mason refers to himself as hard case there be also other comment where the character would try to build up the other character such as when lomax say you don know mason hate it when movie do this they try to make you believe how tough character be by other character talk about him would prefer to see how tough he be by his action rather than be tell about it constantly use dialogue several part of the movie such as the stalemate in the shower seem melodramatic and reheased couldn imagine michael biehn in real life give the we spill the same blood in the same mud speech to general that hold gun on him but that just my opinion cage play the geek very well with some very humorous scene the scene near the beginning where he difusing the bomb and find the playboy mag and gas mask and his assistant scream about the long needle be darkly hilarious love that sort of humor there be lot of very good scripting such as the dialogue between cage and connery about the difference between winner and loser and cage actually m chemical super freak response be great one liner do feel like there some be plot hole or at least some weird occurances for example when cage call his girlfriend and tell her not to come to san francisco she yell back into the phone like hell win and hang up why would she do that wouldn she more likely ask something like why not or at the very least maybe start accuse him of be with another woman of course this be the perfect vehicle for her to come to san francisco against his wish and have to be rescue it didn make sense but it make the story move along also she run away from the fbi agent when he come to pick up her why because the fbi agent refuse to answer her question about where her boyfriend cage be why would she run away would assume the fbi agent be there to take me to safety or to her boyfriend but again by run away this further the plot now she in danger and cage can agonize about her fate and thus he have motivation to disarm the poison rocket if she have stay and allow the fbi to whisk her to safety he would not have be motivate to save the city he already be show to be bit of coward in the scene where he throw up out of nervousness of course in other scene he terribly heroic his character be bit inconsistent but you could explain it as him be thrust into the situation and once there exceed his prior limit the incinerator be another weird plot device it look bit unrealistic it be obviously something dream up for an action movie with move cog wheel that would turn and have to be dodge by the hero all the while fire be rush through the same area ve see an incinerator and it didn resemble this monstrosity at all have no idea if the motion sensor that detect the marine arrival be accurate and if the military really have something this sophisticated but think it be an ingenius idea you may feel differently but actually enjoy the villain of the story more than the hero most of the line that strike me as powerful be deliver by the noble villain harris and morse find the combination of ed harris david morris and michael biehn admittedly not villain in this movie powerful combination consider all these actor excellent and the stalemate in the shower room be especially powerful as well as the standoff with the villain near the end these scene didn feature connery or cage or the occasional humorous tension breaker these scene show us that all villain be not the same and that some villain be evil and some just misguide this degree of gray in an otherwise black and white character movie add level of complexity to the film thus film that would have otherwise say be okay become really good action movie with some character that actually care about there be lot of violence and profanity and brief sexual situation although no nudity near the beginning despite my problem with some of the dialogue and plot find this movie enjoyable and engage if you don mind overly macho acting and some silliness in the dialogue and you love action then you ll probably love this movie if see serious characterization and motivation if more your style you might want to check out steel magnolia and leave the rock at the video store
punch above their weight yep punch above their weight and get smash when work on low budget understand that and work with it the dialogue be atrocious the character swing from one end of the spectrum to the other within the same scene for no reason full of cliche and unrealistic character interaction why on earth do the alien set up 1 acre farm with slave labour again another alien flick where apparently the alien just don have the idea to develop weapon that be accurate despite their technological superiority just so much do not make any sense oh look watch it on rainy afternoon have couple of laugh
house by the cemetery be absolute garbage fulci at his bad finally watch house by the cemetery last night and must admit be quite disappointed deem by many fan as be one of fulci most gory prepared myself for countless scene of bloodshed and gore and instead get nothing more than the usual pap feature in the countless horror film of the 1980 and few dust bunny that be blow across the floor fulci the king of gore have prove in the past with such film as zombie the beyond and city of the living dead that movie with terribly thin plot and terrible actor can still entertain with high level of unnecessary and perhaps redundant gore but house by the cemetery be an entirely different story altogether fulci continue his usual tradition by cast the bad bunch of actor that could be scrounge up at the local playhouse and give them ridiculous script dialogue to be deliver while give the audience countless camera shot that pan across the eye of the actor as they try to make sense of the imminent danger that they have be put in first of all the title of the film be mislead yes there be house by cemetery but the main focus point of the film seem to lead to the dwelling of the cellar beneath the house the cemetery itself really have no relevant bearing on the story it be just sinister backdrop to the house shallow attempt to make the situation seem more eerie than it really be the thin plot revolves around an incredibly stupid couple norm and lucy who leave their comfortable town house in new york city for the quiet dig of new england manor that they haven even see before sign the paper with the realtor they also have an infant child bob who appear to be quite androgynous thanks to the ludicrous voice over provide by woman who also dub the voice for little girl she make bob look and sound incredibly stupid every time he open his mouth to say something nothing be quite believable by the time the troupe move into the freudstein house as know by the realtor and her assistant oak house to norm and lucy strange happening begin to occur once they take occupation of the residency mysterious noise the sound of child whimper and the fact that something evil in the cellar be make nuisance out of itself by kill off everyone who make the mistake of move into the house should have be enough reason to send norm and lucy pack their bag and demand full refund from the realtor but do they move out think not instead the happy threesome decide to blow off the strange phenomenon with bottle of xanax while turn blind eye and deaf ear at the same time to add to the silliness mysterious babysitter by the name of anne move in with the family who seem to know something about the strange happening relate to the cellar yet be stupid enough to venture down into the dark to get herself off in ridiculous fashion involve butcher knife there be one scene of gore in the opening scene where woman be murder by knife wield zombie who get it through the top of her cranium the blade penetrate through her open mouth other than that no scene of further violence take place until at least an hour into the movie if you don count the scene involve decapitate mannequin as witness first hand by bob and later through an un related flashback by nancy some above par gore scene contain in house by the cemetery would include man get his throat tear out and woman meeting her demise with screw driver type implement after she get her foot stuck in crack in the floor other than that there be very little body count contain in the film and one death scene be just plain confuse which involve woman get drag down set of stair by her foot hit every step on the way down with her head only one scene stand out for me in this movie and that be when the realtor back out of the driveway after lead the family to their new home accidently knock over tombstone to which she yell damn tombstone before speed off in cloud of dust this be also just one of the many countless incident contain in the movie that bare absolutely no relevance whatsoever on the plot include scene where anne be clean up trail of blood off the kitchen floor and an inane second story line involve prior occupant of the house who commit suicide after claim the house be possess him when the evil be encounter in the cellar you will be amaze to find how much its motif for be down there in the first place have absolutely no baring on anything else that have take place in the movie nothing seem to make sense and the end be just confuse m not exactly sure what lucio fulci have in mind while film this movie but think the finished product be of something that not even he could have envision house by the cemetery be absolute garbage at its bad and should be avoid by all fulci fan my rating 2 out of 10
refresh you can watch this movie without patience it be really really slow burn but unlike blockbuster trash that constantly serve everything serf purpose to the plot life be not 90 minute show and this movie isn about runtime or show it have message it have motif and it feel like read classic great honest job
recommend purely to finish the saga kill bill volume 2 2004 direct by quentin tarantino star uma thurman and david carradine plot overview continue after event of kill bill vol 1 after defeat 2 5 of her target the bride uma thurman continue to wage her one woman war against those who wrong her and she still take no prisoner it certainly different but disagree that that make it good my issue with this film be the difference in tone and style adore volume one for its masterful visuals great action and fun story this film be on the opposite end of the spectrum in genre it a more grounded story drive conclusion to tarantino original saga and wouldn be bother if the two film be so different if tarantino do an entirely separate story drive and ground story then d be down with it would but the fact that the first film be an excellent action film and this isn annoy me greatly and the disconcert between the two be stupid pick style and stick with it personally don think that this be the good half of the saga not even close don tell me that be just blood thirsty action junkie who can not enjoy dramatic story be not love drama as genre but hate how tarantino have try to mesh the two into this saga if you like it then that be fine but it really do not work for me the carry over story be still really good the through line remain and be still thoroughly engage in the story line it include some really incredible and gut wrenching scene which be the highlight of the film really admire that and one scene in this movie make me actively dislike the end scene of the last movie not action scene but emotional scene the film finish the story well enough but do not think it recapture the magic of the original uma thurman be excellent in this movie and maintain the highlight of this saga we also learn lot more about her character in this film which think be genius idea there be one specific piece of information wish be leave ambiguous about her that they reveal it doesn affect quality in any way but think it would add lot to the mystique of her character if we weren tell this piece of information david carradine be great as bill bill be strange think like him as an antagonist but can not be too sure he hit all the right cue and be threaten enough but can be certain in whether he an excellent villain or an average one he in that little grey area daryl hannah be appropriately loathsome as elle driver she do good job and the actual character be pretty decent one she be good minor antagonist technically wise it be still very nice look movie and do still appreciate tarantino masterful style that say do think that the novelty of see his style in volume one do wear of in this film not that that retract quality it just make it hard to praise when it doesn feel as fresh and invigorate the use of black and white be also very nice but it do occasionally come of as abrupt and strange the score for these film be incredible the soundtrack be excellent and can not commend the composer and tarantino himself for assemble such an awesome array of music and sound effect as far as action go be underwhelmed in this movie have doubt that they could outdo the crazy 88s but still have hope they do not there be one action scene in this film and it be fine it wasn too memorable but it be certainly entertain none of the action be mediocre it just isn great when compare to the original which be incline to do because it a direct continuation and i can really want to like this movie but be thoroughly disappointed the first one be such fun inventive stylise movie that could barely poke flaw in this try desperately to ride of volume one steam and ultimately fail only and mean only recommend you see this film to see how the story tie up aside from that it be very bland and forgettable experience

it hard to describe just how much hate this movie seriously will ferrell come across as some kind of retard who shouldn be allow anywhere near kid let alone as one of santa elf suppose my experience of this film be worsen by the fact of be strand in cheap motel in canada during the holiday season while my companion insist on watch this she think it be cute nuff say this be just such loathsome nauseating and at time diabetes induce nightmare that be at loss for anything more constructive to say think probably despise will ferrell even more than jim carrey after be expose to this abomination although will admit they both give me the major creep in very similar way be pretty open mind about film didn even mind battlefield earth or barb wire that much and like all kind of obscure art house film as well as some of the low rated trash but this just don get how anyone can give this film rating above awful
gut wrenchingly posture can only imagine this be and american vision of the english of the past the insipid an desiccated presentation of english class difference people be either stick up and boring or inarticulate forelock tugging and boring creepy cold piano chord accompany the most banal of conversation as part of truly deadly score throughout ralph fiennes county accent be full of public school flaw and in portray rather self conscious man over egg it so much that just felt embarrass for him all player wooden through and through terrible screenplay not glimmer of humour or self reflexivity in any of these character which render them 2 dimensional m glad that so many people seem to enjoy it what an utter waste of money it would have be otherwise be one of the few people knew who find the english patient to be an insipid bore and be surprise to find that we have not evolve from this pretentious and silly imagining of the english class system of yore
a travesty few word come to mind while try to write about this particular piece of cinema this be quite possibly the effect of actually watch the unfortunate burlesque that be force will admit to have see this movie under duress and out of obligation which likely will have decrease the potential for enjoyment kid movie isn always mean to be meaningful work of cinematic art however filling child with this meaningless dribble will lead more towards the stupid and thoughtless society of george orwell 1984 this movie have budget of over 80 million dollar and more than triple that in gross revenue what do this say about today society it point towards general decline of intelligence and as well as decline in the ability to discern between that which be worthwhile and that which be detrimental my last complaint be the music choice someone get pay too much for find the song feature could have save them money and just direct them to billboard hot 100 the music be an obvious and shameful attempt at pull in the mass of popular medium control adolescent want nothing far to do with this morbid bit of refuse
criminally underrated war masterpiece this be one of the best war film of all time it be extremely intense and almost seem as relentless in the portrayal of war as the taliban must have be in their daily skirmish with the american force this tell the story of the most decorated company of the afghan war their outpost which happen to be tactical blunder surround on all side by the hindu kush mountain and their fight to the finish which lead to the high battle honour there be interest insight on leadership and the effect that it can have on the subordinate as well as the opponent then there be pointer about the instinct rule the heart and the mind in the heat of the battle it be first rate and it be real shame that it hasn receive the recognition that it rightfully deserve among my top 3 film that have see this year pre and post lockdown its rating on rotten tomato of 91 be close to the quality of the experience can be recommend highly enough be in the unmissable category
one of the bad movie of the 80 dirty dancing be in my opinion dreadful cheesy movie dislike it the first time saw it and my opinion of it have not change since then it be badly direct and produce film and far to sickly sweet it be an awful movie which for some strange reason be very popular despite its awfulness even the song the time of our life be dreadful middle of the road bland 80 pop bad music for very bad film if you have any taste whatsoever do not watch this movie
individual part great than the whole one of this movie most famous image chaplin slide around inside the gear and cog of monstrous machine provide handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general there be individual cog that remember as be brilliant but when put together they don make totally satisfying machine unlike city light or the gold rush before or the great dictator after didn get catch up in the narrative of modern time and felt there be long gap between the funny bit however some of the set piece in this be hilarious most notably the scene where chaplin find himself strap into an automatic feeding machine that go berserk and nimble scene on roller skate that showcases his athleticism sadly modern time be an all too applicable metaphor for chaplin place in the film industry new technology be begin to make his artistry obsolete and the sadness of that be palpable in the film final shot m recommend modern time because it a very good movie just didn think it be as good as some of chaplin other well know project
not as good as they make you believe don believe the hype people seem to go out of their way to tell you how great this film be the truth be that when it come to the crunch it actually not really anything that special pearce as the man who have no short term memory after he sustain brain injury when his wife be rap and murder be competent enough but this film do get really annoy in the way that it loop within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you be at 2 minute ago and then move onto the next scene that be really annoy lot of this only make sense in the last scene when the sammy story finally come to point but by then it take an effort to sit through lot of the rest of the film make no mistake it not bad but it not anything sensational either
not as good as d hop d heard lot of great thing about this film before go out to rent it but once do must say be not extremely thrill with it as the rest of the world seem to be it be brilliant and creative idea of how to make movie backward revealing of piece of the story with every new scene but unless miss something believe that this be all this film have to offer the acting be good the story be good the movie be good but do not believe it should be rat the number 1 best indie film and number 10 best film of all time as it be on imdb while write this review think it simply receive lot of praise because it be movie make in way that no one have ever see before friend even tell me that he think it be an amazing movie though he didn quite totally understand it maybe it be appeal because it be confuse and people view it as smart film because they can quite follow totally what it go on and they have to watch it over and over again either way believe it have receive much more acclaim than it deserve it have certainly win many award for great editing and original screenplay etc which it have but movie of the year or of all time as some imdb user be rating it totally disagree finally it be indeed totally original in the way story be tell and present but it be certainly not the great movie of all time be disappoint overall with this film do not believe it be must see could film an entire movie by attach camera to dog back and have him film the action then play it on the big screen mirror and upside down during some scene that would certainly be an original idea never see by movie goer before but that doesn mean it should be vote into group with the godfather or citizen kane m not say memento be like watch an upside down film from dog point of view but m say it up there with the godfather for reason that it should not be
plot costume and theme review know little bit about comic book and know some about avenger assemble it make this film the avenger direct by joss whedon even more enjoyable for me when earth come under attack by asgardian loki tom hiddleston in his pursuit to get the tesseract it be up to h e d to pull start up the avenger after small town be almost completely destroy by thor on previous visit to earth h e d decide that they need something that could take on anything that be not from this world so when nick fury call on some of the big hero earth have ever meet iron man robert downey jr hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarelett johansson the hulk mark ruffalo captain america chris evans and of course thor chris hemsworth the theme of this movie in my opinion would be man vs man this be because throughout the entire film there be some sort of conflict go on the first and main conflict that appear be loki attack h e d take control of hawkeye and dr selvig in order to steal the tesseract and use it for his own purpose second conflict that appear in the film be between thor and loki when thor still consider them brother loki retaliates and say that he be not really his brother and that he should still be the true ruler of asgard with the costume that have be choose for this film it help to create the aspect of the hero be more than normal human even with hawkeye and black widow black widow have be train pretty much from birth to become killer and hawkeye have advance skill in marksmanship with thor costume he be wear something that help to prove that he be not from earth and from another world now for iron man he make his own super suit that could do almost anything which include keep him safe from be tear up from the roaders on the ship that h e d be function from after an attack from loki and his minion finally in the final attack with loki and the avenger thor take loki back to asgard to deal with his fault there where the intention be for him to be properly punish this be must see film especially if you be comic book junkie
surprise felt the same way about hush didn expect much but be leave think about the film day after d watch it must view for any horror fan check it out you win regret it
spielberg all the president men the difference be the latter wasn about anything but the men try to get story find it ironic that when film desperately want to tell people that truth should be available to the public it fabricate lot of detail to service what amount to dull story while beautifully craft this film fall very flat mostly because the agenda be to link trump with nixon since this have be do to death very little be as amusing as watch social elitist scramble to dig dirt one be leave with why katherine graham husband former editor of the washington post have commit suicide but that not the story spielberg want to shove down your throat it be about freedom of press and forgive me for say newspaper don have that power the internet have today before they have to fact check and wait to get the story correct these day and the wp be the bad offender they get the story out first so forgive the public for not pump their fist in triumph at the end when the supreme court agree with the 1st amendment yawn that be the problem with this film have it be make in obama 8 year we might have brace ourselves for the future which it even more odd that we be able each one of us americans to share our opinion such as on imdb or on our own blog when be this really an issue other than to lay defiburillator paddle on printed press look m always in awe of spielberg talent this be beautiful movie as usual it craft really well but the earnestness of his message be similar to child tell you about his butterfly collection that you know doesn do jack for society and it beat the drum over and over again strong strong performance but this be such letdown from the energy that know will most likely be in ready player one
it be not remake don take note of the other review it follow on in the same light as the other ocean movie it also isn a remake who care that it an all female cast it shouldn matter don take it seriously exactly like you didn with the others it funny light and good to watch
visually top notch storyline weak be pixar fan no doubt they be second to none do what they do the imagery of rataouille be simply stun the people at pixar have do it again they 39 ve surpass themselves all surface so beautifully textured add strong sense of realism to the surreal universe that 39 computer animate movie and the movement of the character be so very alive and it all look so easy but anybody with even the small interest in animation will tell you it be not br br the storyline however be imho definitely one of pixar 39 weakest it 39 not completely without merit though where most of the character leave me somewhat indifferent the food critic anton ego for instance be subject to most compelling portrayal sadly he be only minor character the big problem with the story of ratatouille be for me however not in the character but in the mere fact that didn 39 laugh now compare with early pixar movie like toy story monster inc and my all time favorite the incredibles that all have me laugh loud amp heartily from start to finish this seem to lack the trade mark pixar humor
awful awful awful m always shock to read so many good review of contact particularly among people claim to be sf fan this movie be one of the bad sf movie ever make it really should have have peter graf in it just for the theme it be carl sagen tell us that we be stupid and he be not find myself want to yell at the screen during the movie many time when the entire planet field of expert could not seem to figure out something that be so obvious to me the religious element of the story be just plain dumb do anyone recall there be belief test for astronaut before what be really amazing be that this religious extremism on the part of the government be suppose to be happen during the clinton administration there be not one believable character in the government plot there be no hint of scientific method the science be just plain bad m remind of many star trek episodes where someone say they hear voice or saw vision the be immediately discount as have stress problem or some other mental problem this on ship where this type of stuff happen all the time this movie do this as well it protrays the entire world as not willing to pay any attention to what someone say when it unexpected what do they expect could go on and on and about contact it just so amazing to me that so many people turn off their brain and go into dreamland while watch it it a seriously bad movie
alien in present day earth weyland industry have find an unknown heat signature in antarctica charles bishop weyland lance henriksen gather team to explore pyramid bury deep underground inside they find an altar which they activate meanwhile three predator have land to collect their trophy this be an idea create out of desperation both predator and alien franchise have run their course somebody come up with the insane idea to marry the two franchise there be reason why only henriksen return it should have be an obvious mistake to bring alien into present day and on earth it rip apart the original alien franchise canon if there be any redeeming quality it be to be find in the movie itself it be pretty simple creature feature with 2 different creature one must abandon all hope of the enjoyment from the original franchise there be no hide the creature they be revealed quickly director paul s anderson bring along the monster and produce nothing good there be no imagination at least enough money have be spend that the production doesn look completely cheap that be all the good could see here
welcome to the house of dumb remember halfway through cabin in the wood how it go completely off the rail in the most delirious way possible that be bold expect no such curveballs from you re next this basic cheapo slasher have take two year to reach the silver screen although it not clear how it ever make the step up from dvd it have kim newman video dungeon write all over it the story concern reunion of the davison sibling at their wealthy parent country home tension bubble under the surface during some sporadically engage early scene then the family start get pick off by crossbow sniper soon the killer be in the house take out family member one by one as they inexplicably go explore room on their own there will be blood there will be predictable twist there will be dearth of surprise lack of innovation wasn a problem for recent horror hit the conjuring but then that movie be propel by skillful performance the subtle building of tension fine script plausible character motivation elegant direction and editing and some imaginative scary encounter you re next have none of these thing do it have anything go for it the presence of strong female protagonist be always welcome if sharni vinson be scream queen then she not the one do the screaming also the film score be distinctive start with dark sear drone and slip into some late rolling synth but it isn enough to make up for all that risible truly the dialogue scene have my auditorium sniggering later when the blood start flow throughout the repetitive fight scene snigger become full laughter and yet there be no evidence of archness or knowingness on writer director adam wingard part if this be parody then never felt like be in on the joke it just seem like poor script make into poor film
something that rhyme with hobbit start with sh the third part of the trilogy be by far the bad ever movie inspire if inspire be the word to be use in any relation to this movie by talkien book if peter do it for money understand hope he be happy for take the money from people earn 250 eur per month in my country and that be with the story which be about how gold eventually corrupt everything in way he prove the point didn he but if peter truly believe that this be the hobbit than something be seriously wrong with his reading and direct skill hollywood at its bad 144 minute of violence base on anti war child book could there be big nonsense than this fortunatelly this give an opportunity for someone to make good hobbit movie soon
rubbish movie that lack meaningful score and lose itself in its pretentiousness movie should be make to entertain not by for globe or some other hollywood bauble that we be suppose to live in awe of at yet another meaningless ceremony stop deliver this drivel and make real movie
network brazil clockwork orange videodrome wow my favorite actor and my favorite singer in the same movie deborah harry of blondie fame give great non blonde performance as an emotionally energized radio show host and james wood be scummy business mind owner of seedy tv station like brazil or twelve monkey this movie will make you think and even though there isn really much violence or horror your mind will fill in the part that aren there the ability of movie to do this make it must see alone you constantly ask yourself be this real just as the main character be ask the same thing one thing about this movie be that they never really answer lot of thing as we watch the main character go in and out of reality the audience be never quite sure what be really happen either they never tell us they never truly explain who be behind videodrome or even what happen to jam wood if you didn like the end of network or twelve monkey then you win like the lack of explanation here either lot of underlying message here too involve television pornography and technology all of which be more significant today than in 1983 note common theme such as the head in box excellently make film the only thing that would have make it good be more story
unequivocally terrible peter jackson with this new trilogy which adapt somewhat long child fairy tale into three part action epic each movie be three hour long and delve into completely irrelevant story that be only hint at in tolkien body of work have really destroy his reputation as the tolkien translator he will always live in the shadow of the lord of the ring which be sumptuous beautiful heartrending thrill masterpiece don know what happen but jackson sacrifice tone realism characterization and story when he adapt the hobbit it be unrecognizable as work by the same director there be so many problem with this trilogy and this movie that be nigh impossible to list them nearly every scene be real travesty and the whole operation be an affront to the source material and fan of lotr the movie make hyper violent beheading and mass slaughter into orgy of staged action sequence and dumb gag the orcs which be now entirely computer generate be no longer compel or realistic and they be seemingly significantly more fearsome than in lotr it take what the audience understand about middle earth and make it big in completely childish overextension of the original story to make thing even more epic be worm and enormous bat these don exist in the large and more climactic battle in lotr but sure they exist back then right sure jackson also turn character into absolutely ridiculous flat caricature thranduil the bourgeois blue blood rid an elk dain thorin cousin who rest his enormous high pitch scottish girth on wild boar the she elf who fall in love with dwarf it stomach churn how peter jackson have combine love for extreme violence and an eye for juvenile gag and unbelievable character and in beloved classic set this movie once again extend legolas past human bound past elven bound past the bound of newtonian physic as he sprint newly cyan eye shin on fall brick and hang from bat we get to watch dwarf behead seiging army of orcs who be impotent to the blow of the tiny olympian again oh no middle earth be doom the age of men be over cue slow motion shot of gandalf look stricken thorin kill orcs with sparta kick the feel the script the look be all take from lotr and rehash with this cast of cardboard character in badly render world of excess and fancy expect mature film make for thoughtful audience expect real character live in real world with compelling story but obviously that be too much to expect if one of the important theme of the hobbit be the rejection of greed as we can see personify by thorin then be it hypocritical that hollywood have churn out three abominably shallow and violent film out of the hobbit for the public consumption think so hate what these film represent and what they could have do
a good idea that deserve well expect that rollin when he make this film be just try to make few buck off teenage boy with plain old breast and blood flick and really that all this be certainly every cast member get naked at one time or another and certainly there plenty of blood though the gore be never really overwhelm also the script be pretty poorly write mean it inaccurate to say that the story be full of plot hole the story itself be basically one big plot hole start with the first scene and continue the length of the picture spend lot of the time star at the screen say what but but what what set this film apart though what make it worth watch be the interesting transition take place in the relationship between the main character which intimate depth of story that rollin probably didn intend the story be that catherine the living dead girl in question have to kill and fee on her victim and with each victim she grow more nearly alive but the interesting thing be that as catherine become more nearly human she become more and more horrified with what she become and what she compel to do meanwhile her friend and protector helene at first revolt by the change in her friend become more and more inured to the horror she and catherine be perpetrate it interest that as catherine become more and more human helene become more and more monstrous to me the dynamic between the two main character be an idea that deserve good exploration than this movie be able or willing to give would love to see someone like david cronenberg rewrite and remake this movie believe it could be horror classic with the right people behind it
a few good idea before the brilliant quot pulp fiction quot and the epic quot jackie brown quot writer director quentin tarantino burst onto the independent film scene with this morbid little piece of filmmaking call quot reservoir dog quot it tell the terribly unpleasant story of few chatty thug with color cod name who assemble in an abandon warehouse after jewel heist go terribly wrong loud argument gun fight and nasty little torture scene ensue still tarantino have few good idea and 39 ll give him that narrative through flashback be do with clever flair and do like the way tarantino choose to have all his character lack moral even the quot blue rat quot so we wouldn 39 be force to sympathize with any one of them that 39 all that quot reservoir dog quot really be though few good idea but genuinely unpleasant moviegoing experience rat 99 minute 4 out of 10
the avenger assemble flawlessly m sorry to say the avenger isn a good movie it a great movie it not only the best team superhero movie ever make but it may just be the best comic book adaption make period the avenger be the culmination of what begin in iron man and continue through the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america it be only few year ago that my son and have just finish watch iron man and as the credit be end samuel jackson appear on screen as nick fury and speak to tony stark about join avenger initiative in that short scene the framework for potentially the great comic book movie of all time have begin director joss whedon most know for the v series buffy the vampire slayer take the foundation that be build in the prior film and bring together the great team of superheroes in film history the avenger iron man tony stark robert downey jr captain america steve rogers chris evans thor chris hemsworth hulk bruce banner mark ruffalo black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner as assemble by nick fury whedon script usually include clever banter grip action sequence and an air of mystery and the avenger be no different whedon have an utter love for comic book and it be proudly put on display in the avenger the cast do great job of bring these iconic character to life begin with robert downey jr unlike iron man 2 in which downey seem to skate through scene after scene downey play stark almost effortlessly deliver his line with relative ease allow his charisma charm and smugness to shine through robert downey jr be tony stark chris evans solidify himself in the role of captain america he be very good in his solo film but truly own the role stand alongside iron man and thor chris hemsworth asgardian god thor have some incredible battle scene and indirectly provide one of the film most funny moment after be seriously underutilized in iron man 2 scarlett johansson black widow be provide back story which help in develop the character and provide an opportunity to prove she be much more than just pretty face she as dangerous psychologically as she be physically could envision myself enjoy beat down at the hand and foot of black widow the character be most concerned about be give little story and the least amount of screen time be jeremy renner hawkeye happily he not leave by the wayside and do more than admirable job of develop the character hawkeye stand alongside robin hood and katniss everdene the hunger game as the best archer to grace the silver screen d like to see more of him in film of his own mark ruffalo the most recent choice to play hulk be far well suit to the role than eric bana the hulk and ed norton jr the incredible hulk ruffalo look more the part of the nerdy scientist banner and play the part without look angry in every scene in the avenger the hulk be at his most impressive both in his on screen transformation and the violence he display when the opportunity call for him to hulk out if any character appear to stand out little bit more than the others for me it be the hulk samuel jackson nick fury be finally more than just the guy make surprise appearance fury be finally able to stretch his legs some and jackson slide quite easily into the role clark gregg agent caulson return and cobie smulders make her marvel film debut as agent maria hill and she be welcome addition the film main villain be thor adopt brother loki play by tom hiddleston you would think the part would be difficult one to play be opposite such powerful personality and strong character but hiddleston do fantastic job the performance should not go unnoticed because it one of the strong point of the film loki be not villain without purpose and hiddleston come across as devious mastermind without be cartoonish at run time of 2 hour the avenger be well pace and time fly by the effect be top notch the acting be very good and the script drive the movie elevate its strength for viewer that may not have see any of the other film and if so why not we re provide just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without feel overdone whedon provide more than just standard comic book film but story with reason that back up with incredible action and humor although the film be fill with large than life character none be short change each character be give at least one great scene to work with and the opportunity don go to waste the film finale provide deafen crescendo of action that be breathtaking as usual with marvel film be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence which provide surprising reveal go into the avenger with unfairly high expectation due to all of those that be involve as well as the film that come before it after view the initial trailer and not be blow away have set myself up for disappointment it be only matter of minute after the film start that be put at ease and just minute later when my expectation be blow away never imagine that it be possible to put onto the screen what be watch m happy that marvel have the sense to keep these property to themselves and to move forward with these character in the manner in which they do marvel studio and disney be go to make boatload of money off this film and deservedly so because there never be another movie make of its caliber grade
all the sex appeal none of the heart clearly the design team be talented and this film be indeed visual spectacle but the director clearly doesn understand why the anime be special this barely touch on the core theme of the original it be hollow beautiful but hollow
a stylish and excellent example of expert story tell after watch this half dozen time with biased anti tarantino quot what the heck be so great about this guy anyway quot view which as most anyone watch any film with that view and fair bit of self knowledge will tell you be rather fruitless practice in pointlessness if you 39 ve decide you 39 re not go to like it there 39 very little reason to think that you will no matter how good it be you need an open mind finally decide to give it fair hearing and saw it for what it be an unusual film at least for its time stylish film full of cool dialog cinematography editing and music the whole thing come together perfectly and be very short of create sublime film experience the plot be excellently write and tell the pace be perfect wasn 39 bore for second nor do ever really want it to move faster or slower the cinematography be magnificent and incredibly well integrated pan dolly trip and l we forget the stationary shot all perfectly use very stylize the acting be top notch all round with most of the cast be name actor this be no surprise but they really do shine madsen buscemi keitel roth all incredible the one role that have less than good well let 39 be honest it have rather awful act 39 speaking of course of tarantino 39 character now don 39 get me wrong in from dusk till dawn this man do great but just about any other time 39 ve see him act he just doesn 39 seem to have the first clue be film maker myself albeit on somewhat of small scale than quentin can relate to want to cast yourself in role but sometimes you just need to face up to the fact and admit it if you can 39 act still that be minor complaint another one might be that there be at least two fairly big character that seem completely and entirely expendable they have no real role in the action and could very very easily have be cut with no real loss to the overall product win 39 name them here but anyone who 39 see the film will know who 39 talk about all the character however be well write and their action credible tarantino know his stuff when it come to write something that also show in the dialog which although somewhat draw out at time be exceptional well deliver too when it come to direction he show how talented he be as well the film be very well put together the editing be great with the non linear time line tell the story far good than quot regular quot film ever could one of the many tarantino fan in fact the very person who originally talk me into watch this film once tell me that he have heard of someone edit film with such time line this pulp fiction memento etc so that their time line be perfectly linear 39 sorry entirely respect their right to do such thing and win 39 claim that their do so have less artistic value than the original film in any way but refuse to watch that big part of this be so well told lie in the time line also 39 a firm believer of watch something the way the maker intend it don 39 edit don 39 censor don 39 make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that your own version and not the original sorry rant over finally just need to comment on the music the soundtrack of this be just great tarantino collect so many amaze 70 39 tune for this film and use them great all in all just really really good film very little keep this from be perfect ten most of which 39 ve cover here recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who like their film with side of style 8 10
could have be lot well they really destroy this character this movie be to conventional it very boring and slow the director doesn make good job the cinematography be very conventional but you could really think that this movie be telefilm bore telefilm the movie be very small it only take place in one scenario and the cinematography be very weak you think that this movie be low budget movie but not it have very big studio behind it the cast be very very good the actor try to be charismatic and cool but the script be so bad and everything seem so force that you lose the quality of the cast the vfx be good but there aren any action sequence till the first movie hour what really make the movie slow in his first two act the ost be conventional the aren horror scenes the character could have be charismatic but they aren could have be so well everything have such potential but they just throw everything
the team very good movie if you be look for light funny and action pack movie it doesn get much good than this the team be very very easy too take in but never boring have action scene that will blow you out of your seat and be stuff with plenty of damn funny moment also very nice for change this action comedy film doesn take itself too seriously which be quite refreshing if you take look at all the comedy with message crap hollywood produce these day the new a quinton rampage jackson murdock sharlto copley hannibal liam neeson and face bradley cooper be all great at their role prop for patrick wilson as the slick i agent lynch and jessica biel be lovely as always joe carnahan who write and direct this movie simply do great job and give the audience exactly what it need d say it be definitely worth my money
just an okay movie in the beginning of the movie the plot be pretty bore but kinda like the end the plot be too simple but didn expect too much when saw this movie if my friend invite me to watch this movie again gon na say yes
awful but funny thing ever imagine some really bored medium student who have rent motor home and have load of popcorn to be use then imagine film where those be the most expensive thing in it this be that film the new mutant yet have no mutant just goblin but hey the first time saw this wish have be wear nappy or sit on very big sponge it be that funny personally could not get up from roll around on the floor nor the people be with although they have it bad as they keep fall off the bed unfortunately it be funny without mean to be simply because it be that bad it seem to just have people drag in from the street in the lead role which could well be true maybe somebody be very drunk when they decide to make this film or when they make it or when they go ahead with all the stage of production just possibly anyway it be hilarious get my dvd copy for 2 that say it all really would say watch this film if you want to see neon colour food child in mask and dress in sack charge around forest set to dodgy 2020 theme awful make up bad act even bad dialogue the funny yokel ever include anya taylor nuff say and the mighty weapon ever see in any film ever go on watch it best laugh of my life could be yours too
it be okay ish not enjoyable though it might be my own perspective and belong to different religion and can really comprehend the christian culture and its strictness but the movie wasn enjoyable at all it just take way too long before something worth watching happen as normal viewer it be waste of time honestly
not very timeless believe this be the first of the more recent full length animate feature film to lose the disney touch for some good point first the animation be great and story have potential about poor street urchin name aladdin who meet princess in disguise the palace fatigue jasmine on the street they fell in love with each other afterward but the only problem be that princess jasmine can only marry prince accord to palace standard throw in the mix be the evil vizier jafar who want to control the land and the slapstick genie of the lamp and the music be great whole new world be breathtaking and one jump ahead be very catchy however do not believe the screenplay story be very captivate lack the charm and uniqueness that be find in previous film like beauty and the beast and the little mermaid the movie be tell in way that resemble teenage bop love story some of the character particularly that of the genie be very over the top robin williams do very overzealous voice act job for the character and he seem too comedic and nonsensical he make too many modern day reference consider this movie be suppose to be set in ancient time and the character of aladdin take on too much of surfer dude personality not very genuine overall ll admit m probably in the minority at least on imdb for negatively critique this movie but aladdin rank as one of my least favorite movie from disney grade
a film well worth watch just return from watch this movie and frankly didn even know it be story take from an early series until wikipedia ed it just now that be say the expectation and sensitivity in fan of the original series be non existent in me so this be purely base on what felt about the movie itself first off the casting be near perfect everyone have role that they play very well and while rampage jackson act could have be little well his presence and screen time be downplay to perhaps make up for it but that what m talk about it be very good balance of character that be consistently carry throughout the movie who really stand out for me be sharlto copley for someone who wasn professionally train as an actor he portray the crazy murdoch flawlessly bring my parent to watch the show and they love his performance with mom go as far to say the movie work because everything funny come from him have to agree be certainly very entertain for the whole duration of the movie largely due to him what didn particularly like be the computer generate effect they look quite fake at time and it hint at rush job by animator while the first three quarter of the film have fairly consistent amount of action the last quarter be overkill spoil the movie little for me but the overall experience be good one movie be mean to entertain and most definitely be much more than expect for the price pay for my ticket word of warn though you really shouldn think too deeply about the story when you re watch this there be unresolved plot hole and some people have express upset at this but the film be never market as story kind of film in any way so they really should ve know well this movie be not for movie buff who look for the meaning of life in film but if hilarious well act action pack movie be your thing say go watch this now story okay act range from awesome to not bad cast dynamic brilliant hilarity factor totally special effect acceptable to meh at time duration long but didn feel it would watch again yeah
bore cringy nope my partner and really tried to watch this movie even though we do not watch musical really 1 hour into the movie and we definitely have enough and switch to another movie as it just be way too boring just could not feel during this movie whether joy sadness nor love really the musical part be so cringy make us feel very uncomfy and we end up skip those part be honestly look forward for this movie but this be bloody disappointment
they ve go full blow insane leftist in the second season oh boy this be good show but they ve go full blown insane hollywood need to keep their insane politics to minimum
craftily engineer film that lack authenticity peter jackson most recent film remake of the 1933 king kong have be receive some critical acclaim must admit the film present some action scene that keep you on the edge of your seat and overall it never become bore that in itself however be not enough to make good film this beg the question what do this film have to offer besides twenty five foot tall monkey sadly not much the dialogue be sparse which restrict the actor in display their capability which some of them have show to possess more than little in previous film the music and scenery be candy for the sens though oftentimes feel too artificial this be problem of the production in another area as well there be quite number of funny or scary moment in it but most of these be so obviously engineer that one be almost ashamed to react to them overall the film lack authenticity if you have see it ask yourself what be in there that have never see before for me the answer be disappointed nothing it be hard to justify the making of this film on that ground especially consider that it last over three hour peter jackson have show himself to be competent engineer now it be time for him to come up with something authentic something that convey new idea or feeling something that do not have minute of wasted screen time in it

i will never get that hour and half back ever there be some film so bad so cynical so devoid of charm wit or intelligence that be make without care script or an idea that you wonder why no one stand up when present with the script and tell the writer dubiously term here to reconsider their life and that maybe they would be good off work some way away from any kind of keyboard everyone involve in this pathetic film should be put into stock on sunset blvd with work on keanu tattooed on their forehead so everyone can throw throw rotten fruit brick and small animal at them this along with jack and jill the adventure of rocky bullwinkle dude where my car and all the deuce bigalow movie be disgrace so bad that would rather watch that contemptible fool donny trump spew his hateful vitriol at least he believe it awful awful awful
a boring classic enjoy most classic horror movie but this one be one of the bad that ve see almost fell asleep several time while watch child of the corn the only thing scary about this film be the awful effect they add the child be just annoy and nothing more didn care who die because none of the character have much of personality expect more out of such popular movie
great uplifting idea spoil by completely unnecessary crudeness it a real shame the premise of this film be about man who turn his life around for the good now normally this can only be good thing and jim carey do fine job of portray the loner and nay sayer that make the journey to the eponymous yes man but and it a big but along the way the plot be spoil by unnecessary crudeness for example there be one barely disguised oral sex scene comment about masturbation and liberally peppered crude language now d have less of problem watch this film if it have high age rating at least d know what to expect but even my 13 year old boy be look distinctly uncomfortable throughout as say there really be no need for the crudeness the story could have stand up completely on its own merit without this tawdry nonsense shame because the rest of it be very good this family give it 3 10
an absolute cheese fest terrible just terrible there nothing wrong with a campy over the top film of do right but everything here just miss the mark unwatchable
twilight with alien ll be honest here be number four be yawn and when m not count minute till it over m snickering at the amazingly cheesy line seriously haven watched movie with lamer line since the twilight series which be shame really since be so anticipate this movie because alex pettyfer be so cute in stormbreaker and d like to see more of him i love diana agron and i love good teen drama superpower movie but ianf be such disappointment in the way that there nothing believable about the movie at all so the mogadorians want to kill the 9 survive lorien kid with superpower call legacy why it not really clear ethnic cleansing perhaps one of the character explain how the mogs don colonize but decimate instead so why go to all the trouble of search for the 9 scatter in all corner of the world why not wipe out earth and be do with it anyway since they live to destroy anyway right it didn help that right when number four number be up pun intend he decide he want to be normal and go to school and the overprotective guardian say yes sure what a murderous predator compare to listen to your teenage ward whine 24 7 right and what with number four propensity to constantly ignore sound life save advice anyway be he try to get kill or be it that it more interesting to have character that break all the rule since the main character never die anyway right all in all d say the movie a flop the character be either annoy unmemorable or carbon cutout of every other movie the appearance of number six make it slightly more interesting but in the end she just blonde version of megan fox the script be painfully shallow and the story just meh
season 4 just finish the 4th season and it good very good thank god amazon save this show the cinematography have become truly amazing while still keep that same mysterious feeling and quality in writing and storytelling love it
just when you think there might be story poof it go this review may contain spoiler m not give summation of the movie plot here but be forewarn for your own information that might make reference and or hint to the storyline in this review this movie isn so much as movie as it be an anecdote it like watch some dismal abyss of film with no plot no real end and just depress story that basically come down to no discernible resolve the actor be spot on tommy lee jones be as good an actor as anyone he always suit as the strong masculine and wise individual salt with the experience of ten men live it be role that he be very suit for and in the last 15 year or so from the role he play in the various us marshal series to the beyond his expectation of year in rule of engagement etc he be very much the tired old veteran who feel he have live beyond the expectation of his life and much of the movie you feel that reflection in his act javier bardem be clearly the self absorb evil character that so many movie have and yet he never have any closure we never get sense that justice have react to his narrow miss with death josh brolin play convince role at time but take issue with certain point in the movie spoiler warn spoiler for example at one point brolin appear in the wild to be successful and talented tracker he portray someone who be not so much intelligent as he be wise to his surroundings and the fragile nature of life and yet he miss deer he hunt why be he in the desert in the first place be beyond me then when he revisit the scene of the various truck scatter upon drug deal go awry he doesn bring his rifle nor his binoculars why would you approach situation where drug money be clearly involve without long range rifle and more importantly no ability to defend yourself how smart do you have to be to dump bag full of money for new bag have none of these people consider that there might be some kind of track device brolin saw the locater earlier what do he think it be for radio control car kind of feel like this be one of those movie that get cut too many time before the film reach the studio and as result we re leave with story that doesn have plot line we re leave with no explanation really of who orchestrate the heroin deal why it go bad more so at first it appear that woody harelson be some photographic memory genius and then get ambush by bardem how do javier track him spidey sense sixth sense do he invoke the great spirit from beyond come on at least give some kind of detail on how and why woody be even involved why would woody even leave the money untouched six out of ten be gracious only because the acting be so good but next time if the movie need to be thirty minute longer to get story across do it because this movie be mess think this must be how everyone at the season end of entourage felt when they screen vinnie cluster you know what of movie great act great actor but story that be about like watch happy gilmore take swing at the puck
if one movie should be call it must be this one one of bad movie ve ever watch and the bad movie of di caprio for sure his scream the whole movie and do nothing
completely engross and stunningly beautiful an arthouse masterpiece the first thing to state about this beautiful movie be that it monochrome so stunningly so that at time you feel you be in photographic gallery rather than cinema the quality of the cinematography be quite extraordinary thanks to lucas zal it also in 4 3 format not the square format of instagram but close we don see 4 3 very often these day but wes anderson use it to immense effect in grand budapest hotel and so do lazslo melis in son of saul it an engage format that draw you in it suggest time before cinemascope 16 9 etc and only really work in period cinema of time this time but it also lend itself to incredible frame such as when our female protagonist float down river gradually disappear out of shot and later in the movie when the chief protagonist leave bus and walk out of frame in composition that henri cartier breson would be proud of it one of the most beautiful movie ve see in many year in truth that probably its big strength it be but it isn really narrative driven more episodic than story drive but it do tell tale about director pawel pawlikowski parent love affair set against the cold war backdrop in his native poland it fairly sordid in way his mother be abuse by her father as child but without anything shock to see imagine yes the two lead joanna kulig and tomasz kot be magnificent brood beautiful although unconventionally so and real lucas zal have great time dwell on three particular thing crowd shot amaze dance sequence amaze joanna kulig the lead amazing in particular joanna kulig have stand out performance she not one to show her enjoyment in life sullen most would say but it be an immense performance it a love story set against the challenge that cold war poland put in front of people of artistic belief where communist doctrine make creativity very difficult what pawel pawlikowski achieves be mood piece of exemplary peerless really detail and it a musical be constantly draw to compare it to la la land yet it be so not la la land partly it down to kulig who share the unorthodox look beauty of emma stone partly it the framing of zal and the music fuse from polish country folk to french basement jazz which la la land would have be so comfortable with this be an oscar nomination shoe in it absolutely brilliant and at 88 minute certainly do not outstay its welcome bravo straight 10 from me
a halloween favorite from dr seuss halloween be my favorite holiday and love to have good scare from watch really good horror movie or just watch classic animate special like this one remember this special way back when be kid in elementary school when it be on tv of course but they don show it on tv anymore now along with the halloween tree which be another favorite of mine and few other favorite too but be lucky to order myself copy from amazon ca it also great film about face your fear like ukaraiah do to save whoville by jump in the grinch wagon of spook to stall for time now that scene really scar the hell out of me as kid would like point the interesting critter of punker pond the gree grump like pink cat live in tree stump be cat lover but wonder what do the bottom half of an hakken krakke look like seal body or the body of an plesiosaurus well don know but it never hurt to use your imagination

the only scary thing be that they make it when saw on the voting panel that some people have give this film score of 10 assume they be unaware that the score wasn out of 100 this be disaster movie in the real meaning of that term poorly write and weakly direct with so called actor unable to act but able to grimace when order to for the first 60 minute the story appear to be go in one direction then it change tack and get involve in power fight with extremely poor special effect unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited power to beat the villain with super power the writer cheat it be obvious that the father be add to the so called story line because it be easy than work out an acceptable denouement not that the write would even know the word denouement some movie go directly to dvd this one should have go directly to the dustbin
bad boring overrate picture one of the bad movie ve ever see nothing really happen ever
if the filmmaker be sincere it truly didn feel that way for me please be warn my review must contain major spoiler as the main reason be so sadden by coco when go to the theater hop for joyous laugh and truly touching and musical celebration of día de los muertos the impression get from trailer clip and review d read prior to my see the film be critical plot point instead of joy laughter and earn tear felt the filmmaker be far too calculate in their usage of an elderly woman dementia and her slow decline toward death so the supposedly uplifting end instead come off as cruel and even heartless in manipulate the audience to tear and likely tap into very sad memory of relative and friend who have pass from dementia and alzheimer i also find the first third of the film almost completely unengaging which truly surprise me as pixar be usually so careful with story and character this felt like film that be coldly calculate to drain tear duct rather than earn those tear from joyous creation and real caring for the character onscreen hope m wrong about the filmmaker intention but come out of the theater thoroughly depress and feel well horribly manipulate dementia and alzheimer be incredibly cruel disease and their reality be very different than how it be portray at the end of coco either the filmmaker and scriptwriter have never actually closely experienced someone they love be take by these disease or they be as heartless as it come in use the gravity of these disease as an easy way to make audience cry to those who love the film and felt it earn its emotion of course hope we will see our relative and friend who have be diminish by memory disease fully restore in the afterlife but here it strike me as cheap quick and easy shortcut trick of manipulation the triumph of the final afterlife scene be either unintentionally cruel or coldly cruel depend on the filmmaker personal reason for include same in the film be warn that if you have closely watch love one deteriorate and struggle with the fear and horror of lose their memory and faculty you too may find yourself angry at film end instead of joyous and uplift the only reason give this film two star be that the animation be undeniably beautiful and some of the song tuneful and engage but that be it for me for any bit of enjoyment of the film
why indian movie don make to oscars normally don go to cinema hall to watch hindi movie because leave the very few one think they be heavily plagiarize either from other regional language or from movie all over the world well today me and my friend go to see kai po che because chetan bhagat be one of my favorite author and this movie be adapt from his novel but we didn get ticket so we go to see zila ghaziabad after watch 5 min of the movie realize why indian movie don get nominate for oscar this movie have cast which any director may dream of mean vivek oberoi sanjay dutt arshad warsi paresh rawal asutosh rana etc etc either the director be new one and have simply follow the style of other movie or the actor be desperately in need for some money it lack act direction edit everything what hurt me be that the audience be cheer the ludicrously odd action scene which can only be possible if the hero be superman same cliché song dance dialogue sit there can tell what will come next after particular scene so when will indian movie be ready for oscars movie like barfi haven see it yet fail to even nominate for oscar so what be the meaning if we produce more than 1000 movie each year and not even single movie get nominate for oscar when will this change it the indian audience who can change this thing if they be not ready to change their thought idea or perspective india don stand any chance at oscar my rating 2 10
great time the cinema young man one of the last of his kind be on the run from those who want to kill him wow this film be an absolute blast cool effect intrigue plot line impressive battle scene it be like watch terminator but with supernatural being there a little something in it for everyone the sci fi fantasy genre mix in with some romance and action my kind of flick haven read the book but here hop there a second film because man this be so entertaining highly recommend watch this on the big screen this remind me why go to the movie 7 8 10
an inspiring and entertaining movie from start to finish think this be the only other non over the top role ve see jim carrey in other then the truman show and he be great his chemistry with zooey be adorable the movie have great message and be perfect if you be look for light hearted positive and fun flick
talk doll do not make worthy specie what can say other than doctor zaius be one of the great antihero or antagonist he not villain he just not pay attention how can you dislike this thing linda harrison also be wonderful understated presence especially her first appearance where she balk at charlton heston then lean forward to sniff him it terrific it have all the charm and ritual of medieval action film and all the thought of science fiction at its best the sequels lack but the first film really have something don watch the remake it just doesn have anywhere near the gut
i wasn expect much from this but wow enjoy the movie so much that come onto imdb and register myself just so that can post review the movie be pack with jaw drop eye pop action from begin to end the drama have mix of sadness comedy and seriousness which be all mixed in together so beautifully to give consistency to keep the viewer star at the screen and be involve in the movie rather than daydream about other thing in my honest opinion would say that it be the best fast furious movie to date want to go see it again by the way realise that this isn the best review in the world or might even be an awful review the point be that enjoy the movie thoroughly and felt should contribute to it high average rating
it not horrid here be some honest thought hype as the bad film of the decade so much that it didnt seem that bad while watch kind of reversal of hype something as amaze only for it to be just ok the first few song be quite unorganized and rebel wilson song be disturb at least to me after judy dench show up it get decently entertain the dance number after that be good and the absolute showstopper be skimbleshanks the railway cat jennifer hudson be jennifer hudson she be good if the first half be as organize and take care of as the second half be it would be much good mckellen be very good as well look cat be hard show to even sell to stage audience it an acquire taste it not for everyone some part cough skimbleshanks be very well do while other part sneeze rebel wilson song be atrocious
beautiful film real tearjerker laugh so hard almost cry to death watch this film when be 14 and it really change my life it turn me into an extreme horror fan only to be disappoint with ton of garbage film afterwards that never really compare to the butcher knife sharpness if anyone know some even well more gory and obscure film please let me know p do anyone else get headache from all of the piercing screaming and sound or be it just me
not impress all critic and movie critic agree that this be an amazing film disagree there be some great kill scene and moment of suspense but fail to see how this be an incredible film the plot be different don get how money and mass killing relate its never explain didn notice at all how the film be inventive in cabin in the wood it be suppose to be not your average story and it really wasn which be why love it this one not so much the first scene be disturb but only because of an old ugly man have sex but also how unoriginal the scene be leave the theater think cool and move on this be only my opinion other people like it which be cool but leave thoroughly unimpressed
elektra rule elektra be phenomenal movie just love this movie elektra be one of the best comic movie ever make think that jennifer garner do phenomenal job play the role of elektra just love jennifer garner in this movie this movie show how great actress that jennifer garner really be saw elektra twice in the theater because it such great movie get both the theater and the director cut copy of elektra on dvd
not great conclusion but still fun for the most part when be child love star war they be basically my childhood in nutshell this one be always my favorite but upon re watch them realize that this be the odd one out the plot isn great it get into it almost immediately so it basically just suppose to be big battle which be fine it doesn feel particularly drag out because of all the stuff that happen but it just felt like there wasn a whole lot of content in the movie the character be fine they be develop in the previous movie and this one be like say just the big final battle for the most part so we don exactly get to know them that much good we still get some new character development stuff but not whole lot change between them which be fine we ve get to know them over the past few movie and now it time to finish off the trilogy probably the big reason why this movie fail be the way in which it decide to end it becomes much more childish movie and after the empire strike back darker tone it really just feel like an awkward transition the final battle be playful and fun not serious it not mean to be but it just doesn follow it predecessor newly set tone at all overall return of the jedi be good movie but as an end to the star war trilogy not as great as it could have be the tone be reset to make it feel like more of kid old kid movie which turn out to be an awkward transition content wise it feel like it lack as well in the end would recommend return of the jedi because if you ve get this far then you might as well finish it it not bad movie it just doesn feel right after the empire strike back
good fun this be one of those legendary film that for some reason just hadn see have now don think it could ever meet the hype that people put on it but can deny that it be good film and certainly one of the iconic one of the 80 it a bit overly long though and think it could have be in need of tight edit but you can argue with the quality and performance give by the cast enjoy this film think it be clever but can say it ll be film return to regularly

wildly overrate the most overrated movie since leave la vega wildly improbable plot turn especially the bedding of the hooker ridiculous contraption take gander at the memorable quote page for this entry if that look like good writing ve get some leftover shane black screenplay for sale comparison to chinatown indicate that well the reviewer be just desperate for something as good as that classic double feature would swiftly reveal this to be the hollow pretender that it be
fairly standard statham movie here killer elite be exactly what have think it to be decent action movie without any major surprise or plot twist it be basically straight out of the highway the entire time don get me wrong it doesn mean that killer elite be bad movie it just make it very predictable one for jason statham play danny movie it be textbook material like his movie and that be why decided to watch this movie as well even though there be nothing new to be see here action fighting and testosterone from start till end be somewhat surprised when find out robert deniro play hunter be in the movie which only make it all the good despite him have small support role and clive owen play spike be really really great in this movie he be so well cast for that role however must say that the one that carry the movie in my opinion be dominic purcell play davy even though usually don like his acting or movie much he do really great job in killer elite and truth be tell then didn know it be dominic purcell in that role before check it on imdb killer elite have lot of action which be to be expect as it be statham movie after all be thoroughly entertain all throughout the movie however it would have be nice with some big plot twist along the way haven read the book on which the movie be base so can say how true it be to the source of whence it come if you want decent action movie without too much to challenge your intellect then killer elite be good choice lot of action scene lot of macho stuff lot of good actor and that be more than enough for almost two hour of movie entertainment
quite possibly the bad film ever make most bad movie even though they be bad can still provide entertainment value for its listener by provide bad dialog to make fun of or glare plot hole that be fun to point out but catwoman be literally so bad in every conceivable way that personally couldn even find enjoyment from point out all its fault there be just so many as others have already point out the film cram it down your throat that halle berry be cat woman to the point of be insult but that just the tip of the iceberg the acting be dreadfully bad the line be terrible and terribly deliver not even george lucas could write dialog this bad the action sequence be out of place and usually happen for no logical reason and the film continuity suggest that two different people with completely opposite personality edit it hollywood would do the whole world lot of good if it blacklist this director from ever make another film ve seem some crappola movie over the year plan 9 from out space killer klowns from out space gigli and can enjoy even the bad one because stop try to immerse myself in the story and just laugh at the film itself unfortunately catwoman be so bad that couldn do either it have no story or compelling character and be just such pile of dung that it can only be describe as an utter waste of time warn anyone consider this movie that you be prepare to throw away two hour of your life that you can never get back friend don let friend drive drunk and they sure as heck shouldn let them watch catwoman
sorry waste of my time alright so saw this movie since have thing with the number 9 like melissa mccarthy and this be suppose to be some mystery in it well even after read other review can not understand what mysterious about this movie the end reveal everything as well as why three life be intertwine the only question pop up my head be be this it read some review to see if get it right and yes that be it although beautifully put together and wonderfully act in my opinion the nine be pretty dull movie
overrate in my opinion one of the most overrated movie of all time this be the bad tarantino movie out there dont understand the movie popularity its just so bad and it doesnt make any sence but on the other hand the acting be good and samuel jackson be as good as you can expect guess it be just not for me and maybe you will like it
mixed feeling king kong be well know story to million of people and director peter jackson have bring it back to the big screen with much long screen time and much big budget be it worth watch my answer would be yes be it as good as titanic or any of the lord of the ring movie definitely no have to admire peter jackson courage to lengthen the story to include more human emotion and he succeed in one area but fail in another area the relationship between king kong and the beauty naomi watt be well define and actually evoke lot of emotion from me the tragedy between king kong and the beauty have connect me with king kong computer generate character and felt sad to see him die however peter jackson also create similar relationship between the beauty and male adrien brody this human relationship of risk all for beauty do not work well and it be greatly overshadow by the relationship of king kong and the beauty the other human character be just like cardboard that be not really interesting and inconsistent except jack black character who be suppose to be the evil character of the movie one example of inconsistency of character development be the captain who switch from greedy practical mind character to bravery and heroic not just once but actually twice in the movie king kong would be much good movie if it only concentrate on the love story between king kong the beast and the beauty it can be much short and much more entertaining overall king kong be still good movie but it be not as enjoyable as the chronicle of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe or any of the lord of the ring movie
red bustier at least daredevil have an excuse he be blind when people say jennifer garner as elektra be the best thing in the movie daredevil m pretty sure they be mostly damn with faint praise after all jennifer while certainly an attractive female come across as sorority pledge playing dress up on and rush night in elektra she look even more ridiculous there have be plenty of great female assassin over the year from the camp of bond villain to the seductiveness of linda fiorentino even the girl next door deadliness of bridget fonda in point of no return female assassin be wonderful staple of filmdom seductive yet deadly garner be neither she look like she be think of puppy claim one reviewer read and concur if the smurfs be rat ninja then garner would still be miscast in smurfette deadly blue her costume certainly don help her cause you almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red victoria secret lingerie just doesn scream stealth or deadly lord know the rest of this mess doesn help garner either while terrance stamp can do no wrong every else seem either miscast or afraid of steal garner thunder add on poor special effect villain that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when kill ninja that crash through window like army ranger gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapon laundry fu japanese villain out of world war 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warm christmas in canadian history the movie clearly take place in the northwest united state or vancouver the day be long everyone be in short sleeve and garner take recreational swim in the lake canadian lake be notoriously cold even in august mind you so when cherub face character asks garner over for christmas dinner elektra isn the only one surprised garner be sexy but when it time to kill she should either get dressed or let the grown ups take care of thing
pretentious self indulgent incomprehensible tripe with all the hype of long awaited movie adaptation come in with little expectation despite my tepid impression of the trailer it turn out this film be slow pretentious more on that later and grotesquely self indulgent fairly good script co write by prodigiously talented david hayter who script men movie and voice act as snake in metal gear solid series have be mar by the film be so overproduce and overdirected it like watch farce for those who be not familiar with the comic book watchman will appear to be one of the weird movie ever make outside of terry gilliam realm terry actually try to adapt the film in development hell in 1986 and 1989 but the project fell apart the plain truth be because of the complexity of watchman as comic book in term of literal read experience that elevate mature comic book to art form it be unadaptable the result of the movie adaptation with bizarre outlandish plot and character arc be disastrous the movie be not clever satire or plausible fantasy as it pretend to be but rather preposterously inane farce comic book and film be entirely different art form with comic adaptation of the movie weak and awful e marvel terminator 2 and vice versa the exception would be well produce and freely styled adaptation of comic book such as men 2 ghost world iron man and the dark knight zack snyder throw in the gimmick reminiscent of music video edit style with slow motion and crank motion for dramatic effect he dwell on the scene of grotesque violence in slow motion as though he love violence pain and suffering because it about make act of violence stylishly appeal contrary to the reality where violence be cruel and uncool the opening credit sequence may be weirdly cool but unabashedly pretentious zack want to tell the world he a cool movie director who make zombie movie re make and an over hyped box office hit 300 which call fascist art in previous review post on imdb the filmmaker love of stylish graphic violence in close ups with slow and crank motion for effect be repulsive thought watchman be suppose to be an action drama film but it feel like watch an action movie that interchange with grisly horror element pretend to dispense philosophical idea of existence like nihilism but not with sociopathic adulation of grisly movie violence as though there any point not to mention an unnecessary semi pornographic sex scene that go on minute too long which again do not serve to advance the plot only titillate the audience to discomforted silence watchman be overlong with some pace tedium in between which make it obvious the film be not tighten zack thought pad the length would make the film at least comprehensible in storytelling but he fail to consider re editing because he want to remain as slavishly faithful to the comic book as possible much to the annoyance of the audience who have not bother to read the comic book with the film flaw as the factor because of the director sheer indulgence watchman be fascinate train wreck to watch from the point of view of casual comic book reader and current college student in philosophy fanboys adulation of the film as masterpiece expose them to be shallow me generation who think those who criticize watchman the movie for whatever reason be uninformed uncultured moron watchman author alan moore be right to demand credit removal as notice in the opening credit sequence with the artist dave gibbon sole credit as co creator because watchman be an awful ludicrously nonsensical movie that will confound the people who have never read the comic book to begin with accept the alternative timeline storyline but the aesthetic of the film be too surreal as patently absurd fantasy the movie be proof some source material should be leave alone because good adaptation in another art form be improbable therefore agree with alan moore protest because it rap the novel aesthetic of story mean to be compel experience in original art form as intend out of 4

the three stooge meet maxwell smart in the rodent world have read so many negative review approach this film with some trepidation but find it actually very enjoyable if you can accept the premise of rodent hero in the same way as you might accept mutant or convict in the same fashion in men or the dirty dozen then you re halfway there the excellent animation seamlessly blend with film be superb as be the pace the humor and dialogue be combination of slapstick and subtlety and therein think lie problem for many viewer maybe too much subtlety youngster will appreciate the slapstick tweens will get what they can from it teens may find it lack and adult well we all bring different viewpoint to our seat in the cinema do we not while it do not have anywhere near the emotional impact of the first part of up it be quite polished and sophisticated undertaking and consider myself fortunate to have ignore the other review and take chance with it would give it very solid 7 but consider the beating it be take will give it an 9 in an attempt to counteract that and don feel guilty in the least for do so
either you love it or you get nothing from it m not professional in film review to begin with m just an university student who get an enormous passion for cinema it be year since movie move my soul in such profound way be stun when saw that the movie sum up 7 5 rating here on imdb think about this fact for some day then kind of make up my answer youth be the symbol of many struggle in cinema and in people mind american movie and many european one as well be so easy to like just because they re easy to follow they show fact action somehow explain by word and some idea idea be like the salt we put on on our meal to make them tasty film like youth be the exact opposite word and idea be the meal and few action be the salt actually all the action be at the end of the movie they could be perceive as climax but they re more like the conclusion of complex exchange of idea throughout the movie win comment about technical feature because don have the expertise to do it just say that the soundtrack be somewhere near perfection editing as well and there some beautifully shot scene as say my concern be not about that youth make the viewer think about life old age ethic it accompany us through some beautiful idea and this be where all pro and con stay this movie doesn look for easy way to impress the viewer to make him her somehow forcefully interested to what the screen show it request an open mind and what ironically call the 51st shade fetish to thoughts not only to material thing some people don like sorrentino because they consider him radical chic intellectual it be righteous choice to be against intellectualism whatsoever but it be as well righteous to be against ignorance
not worth spend money watch this well the movie really suck good thing didn pay to watch this movie it be kinda confuse in the beginning as it wasn show clearly that it be actually 2 different time setting past and present but other than that its just typical over hyped hollywood movie nothing great about the story line it be rather bland and predictable it be almost as bad as devil due needless to mention the bad acting which make the whole experience of watch this movie even bad than it already be smdh and the whole story behind the mirror isn reveal either as to how it become haunt or why be it hell bent on kill people it really doesn make any sense ve see list movie which be far more good than this cant believe it make it to the box office wouldn recommend anyone to pay to watch this movie enough say
hate it but not cause it be bad hat this movie because it hit me so hard lose my dad while back and never deal with all the thing from that but this movie kinda drop kick my feeling into the focus hard to watch film with tear stream down your face
boring where be the fantastic beast what be the crime of grindelwald this be not magic it cgi it lose that essential taste of friendship and bond between character within magical context of the original hp series
oh the confusion be total do not watch look for good movie about fast do not watch pay for this one all in all it be just mess of bad moviemaking mixed with strange back and forth message about fast it surprise me that they get walter and jason onboard this project at all and what also truck me be the long sweeping bodyshoots that where alsmost he whole time wan na know about fast in detail search for jason fung on youtube and watch the long talk there you will really learn thing or two
why do you have to destroy good romantic and inspiring movie with so much musical know that these type of movie be not for everyone realize that it can be boring and that be what happen with me but it doesn have to be for everyone if you re not demand guy if you re patient viewer with cigar relax at his sofa yes you might be thrill despite that think that ryan and emma good performance be waste because it have such good dramatic romantic story that lead to motivation and pure inspire movie relation to music agree it have to be with music and act but without so many musical song every couple of minute think the direction be quite poor and the lighting wasn that great its one of those movie guess that half of the crowd win ever see again and the other half will re watch
a great summer film that the whole family can enjoy we all know that pixar make incredible movie personally have never dislike pixar film the first car film be great movie not perfect film it be one of the least good film pixar have make but that like say insomnia be one of christopher nolan bad film have high expectation when come to see the film like always have before see pixar film after my viewing of the film have to say pixar never fail to produce great entertaining film although it doesn reach the height of wall toy story 3 etc it still stand by itself pretty high up there the animation be extremely well do the look of the film be amaze the voice actor be great miss paul newman though although the film be not perfect the movie be not perfect though the story be not great but not bad the movie do not have the emotional as other pixar film but it be definitely not heartless film but the film be definitely entertaining and great beginning to 2011 summer movie season take your whole family to see this movie it will probably not disappoint it will not only satisfy kid but also the adult this film be for everyone fun for kid but the adult can also connect with it and will have great time watch this movie in theater it be quite an adventure and will be glad to give it second view
what the hell be this lobotomy be good than this do not waste your time and more importantly money on this rubbish this state fund waste of tax payer money be an absolute horror and everyone who be think of see this ask yourself do you want to experience the death of your brain cell
for once the academy get it right with all due respect to eastwood american sniper the academy actually get it right with this pick for best picture every actor and actress in this give the space to breathe life into character every monologue and dialogue hit like ton of brick every scene try to get towards some fundamental truth of human nature only to have the next scene undermine that character and that purport truth it amaze that in the era of comic book universe movie that something like this can get make at all an absolute must see before you die movie
it be an ok movie m try to be fair here and rating it 6 10 it a descent movie likely worth watch for most people watch it few year back before really hear about it and think it be ok make it through the whole thing but there be part that drag and it also borderline depressing at time but have enough humor sprinkle in to get me through it be quirky and can see how the cult classic get attach due to the repetition of certain comedic theme throughout it definitely not 10 10 movie and likewise the 1 10 review be basically just reaction to it overrate ve heard lot about how great it be since the first time saw it and recently just watch it again since it be free on tv the second time felt just like the first it be ok
child of the corny this movie be real let down it start off creepy enough with the slashing of some elderly throat and some mystical choking like the part with sarah the young girl in the beginning and her nightmare but then it go downhill and then some the movie lack an explanation for anything that happen and most of the event seem to jump out of nowhere the whole the one who walk behind the row thing be an attempt to have some type of mystery and intrigue but in the end we find that it really make no sense at all when some random monster just appear from no where burrow underneath the soil yeah that make lot of sense the bad part about this movie it that it really make no sense at all it never explain anything that happen like why job and sarah seem to be immune to the thrall of the cult that isaac so easily assert upon the other child in the town also why the town so swiftly become mysterious and hide down that yielded power so easily such as from the old man at the gas station in only few day the adult die and suddenly the town off the map and the sky seem to yield to the child will it all happen too fast and with no explanation as to how isaac and malachai attain their god like status this movie seem to be quite the cult classic and must have do very well judging by the parade of sequel that follow in its outdated footstep it really too bad perhaps if this movie have never be create all the other terrible sequel would not have be make either my advice be to stay away from this movie you ll expect too much due to its fame and come away disappointed and angry mumble something to yourself about the structure that plot be suppose to follow in movie wouldn even suggest this movie for laughable scary flick would instead shy away from it totally as it fail on both front guess the problem be it take itself far too seriously in correspondence to its laughable plot and story and end up really suck
hold on just minute cartoon city well grow up during this period in the south and we always have black maid we love our black maid veronica first black person d ever see and think she be make of my favorite stuff chocolate and our family correspond with her and send her money for year after we move other family have black maid and no one ever ever ever ever ever talk about them or treat them the way they be in this film haven read the book but instead with value and respect though within the confines of the segregationist time that whole bathroom issue silly never happen that witness or heard of don get me wrong it be certainly period and relationship worth examination from our more modern era can recall at one point go out to visit our maid who be sick she live on piece of farmland have all these child our counterpart and we play together while parent visit though be aware that it be like look in mirror dark on other side and one can bemoan the disparity of the period but we still have it though and still rampart racism back then that be just take for grant by everyone but no ma be nothing about this movie rang true beyond the fact that the maid be always black generally poor and yes help raise white baby sing to them feed them fuss at them do their my hair maybe there be just some peculiar cesspool in jackson but if anyone have act like the villain do where we live she probably be send for mental treatment actually not but everyone would know she be insane and by the way no one back then say damn in front of woman open scene jesus as cuss word open scene and heaven forbid sh many time which never once hear in my life until college in summary this movie strike me as bit of cartoon plunk down in real period lifestyle be cartoonish villain as well as cartoonish heroine guess you need to put in such stuff for hollywood or maybe the writer add it to finally get sell too bad
feel good no simple story you soon forget be surprise over the buzz around this movie and can not really understand why it get so much credibility the actor be good but that be not enough for me this be shallow film feel good not really anti intellectual movie really simple story about two men in paris thing like art classical music opera be bore drug tobacco and soul be good have read some of the other review publish on imdb and may have expect to much and thats never good but even so the story be to easy and what happen to the daughter to many lose end to much fluff for my taste so be sorry low remark from me
great movie not so good musical will probably get lot of hate for say this but this be not the musical pleasure have hop for while the plot and movie in general be great thought they could have do so much well with the music they replay the same song over and over again so much it annoy me yes know it be their song and it be romantic but it get to line where they almost didn care for any other song there be few song maybe 2 3 that really tell story and move the story forward the rest be happy pill where they dance for 10 minute or play the same song the story be great love it but wish they musically could learn thing or two from movie like mamma mia and dreamgirls
beware the wrath of the fan boys disclaimer do not watch the tv show before watch this movie think the last airbender be an ok popcorn movie the setting and special effect be pretty good the big fight scene didn really hold my attention but at least they didn drag on for too long the character be interest the act particular the kid be not go to win any award but be passable some reviewer say the dialog be clunky with too much exposition didn notice that in fantasy film you have to explain more than in real world drama be able to follow the narrative without have to watch second time understand the motivation of the character it a shame that some people obvious love of the tv show have poison their enjoyment of this movie they don seem to realize that different medium call for different treatment of the same story this film be subtitle book 1 water so assume that it cover the same material as the 20 episode tv series obviously lot of scene and character development be leave out of the movie script you can fit an elephant in mini this win razzie for worst film seriously to say this be bad than sex and the city 2 or twilight eclipse be absurd take chill pill fan boy and girl nobody steal your precious memory

over hype the movie be simply put too monotonous boring in my humble opinion sometimes less be more but in this particular case it would have be well if we actually get to see something else than leo walk around in the snow the story be also not very compel which make me doubt why so many people seem to think that this be great movie can sum up the entire movie in two convoluted sentence leo play person who be part of small group of frontiersman who be at war with the native leo get attack by bear almost die remains cripple due to the attack for the majority of the movie watch his son get kill by fellow frontiersman while be unable to do anything about it get leave behind in the wilderness to die by the aforementioned traitor seek revenge get revenge end of the movie it be pretty disappointing and totally predictable the end that be

i don get it why be this movie so critically acclaimed why be it win so many award m baffle it categorize as comedy and don understand why be it black comedy when the actor break the fourth wall turn to the camera and have to explain why what happen in the scene be so outrageous be that suppose to be funny for the average movie goer think it will be an even more boring experience than it be for me m finance professional so already have some understanding of the jargon ve also watch documentary about the mortgage collapse which be far superior to this so this topic be not new to me for someone without this background watch this movie must feel like be force to sit and audit college course in finance why be christian bale win best actor award for his performance he play one note socially awkward introverted shut in how hard be that there be no range or depth to his role if you be work in the extended market of mortgage back security during this time you might find the irony play out on the screen or the cartoonish characterization of some of the key player amuse but for the wider general audience don get how they could be entertain by it maybe it because adam mckay brand of humor do not resonate with me didn think the anchorman movie be funny thought they be dumb perhaps his target audience for this film be the same as for those and they will appreciate this type of humor

well make but want something gritty admit to be little disappointed when find out that master film maker park chan wook late film would be the handmaiden remake of lesbian romantic drama film by the bbc as fingersmith this one relocate tale of victorian london to south korea where murky plot involve mucho double crossing as con man decide to employ maid to help him seduce japanese heiress due to inherit fortune like the rest of park chan wook output this be an expertly make piece of drama with sumptuous costume and filmography and fine performance from the cast pity then that it turn out to be merely romantic drama with few dark twist the emphasis be on explicit sex throughout imagine if the director have instead put his talent to make another film like oldboy now that would have be something special this lengthy languidly pace film have some good storytelling method and nice twist throughout but otherwise it feel disappointingly shallow
not scary but an interesting watch watch lot of horror and it may be that be bit desensitized to what horror be while it be interest to watch and it have couple of creepy moment can say that this be scary movie like that this be about djinn don think there be many movie where the antagonist happen to be djinn and d like to see more film with this theme this be well make film and think the acting be decent the fact that this be set in the middle east make for an interesting watch as custom and belief be different would ve like to have see more character building on the djinn there wasn much describing origins motif and related phenomenon it not what would consider to be an awesome horror flick but it be well than just average probably win watch it again but be glad watch it at least once
this movie make me feel good life full and cazz now like cazz and listen city of star meet new think for me musicals the all these year do not feel musical so much like this after that will try to memorize musical thanks for this movie to for everything gain
just watch it people with the negative review totally miss the whole point of the movie first of all this be not horror movie it a psychological horror the point be not to create scary story or whatsoever it be more the psychology of the person the physical loop represent the mental loop it kinda portrays live lie and not be to live with yourself until you finally break free the dialogue be probably not the best out there but it be not stupid and empty either more of decent regular dialogue but other than that really enjoy the movie it keep me interested and glue to the screen the twist be there the suspense be there the cast be amazing and the aesthetic be beautiful especially the choice of the house if you actually dig and look for that house you will realize that the choice be smart could go longer about this but just trust me when say if you re into superficial horror movie this movie be not for you if you enjoy psychological horror and interpretation then go ahead and watch it
real review from grown adult like saul but im not give this 10 for that reason this movie be slow and bore wind up fast forward just to see the end it have good part the bus scene be really cool but it just so boring really nothing happens for loooong period of time really cool see saul do something else and see dr brown from back to the future be cool but still like watch snail cross an 8 lane highway
one of the best superhero movie ever saw the dark knight about three year ago when be in the 8th grade and be blow away at how beautifully do it be the camera work the act the story it all take me by surprise it be to this day one of the best movie have ever see or will see no other movie can impact you in such an intense way than the dark knight it be movie worth see due to the fact that the worker put so much time and effort into this one film and they do not want to waste money put up garbage so christopher nolan thank you for not waste our time instead earn our time with this film to this day still be anxious to see the movie at home recommend it to anyone who like action movie in general to anyone who doesn don waste your time write bad review about this film
never intend for mass audience consumption think one of the most beautiful irony in recent memory be how the psychologist in watchman be drive insane by dig into rorscarch psyche just as normal american family be drive insane because they go to watchman with their kid not know they be enter the mind of alan moore thats something that most people be not ready for never will be ready for and its the big reason watchman movie could never work as mass audience film especially when literally interpret from the source alan moore go to dark place when he write he ask tough question and his writing be both shock and disturb on many level and it contain whole lotta truth if there be one thing the average person can not handle and do not want any part of its the truth in any form and especially not in their entertainment there be no way watchman could ever be dumbed down enough for it to appeal to wide audience thats not be it be ever intend to do this movie be true to the book on some level it have truth its dark and its disturbing so why do hollywood try and market it as just another super hero movie like the dark knight as if to say it might be something you could take your kid to see have no idea it be probably the big movie marketing blunder have see in long time this movie fail because it do not capture the essence of the character the only one it get close to do so with be rorschach and you just know that hollywood exec be right now try to figure out way to make rorschach prequel movie pg rat of course but so little time be spend on character development for the rest of the character that they come off as flat as cardboard cutout m not say the movie be disaster but it doesn do what the book do in term of the way it make you think and feel and isn that the point if they could not translate that to film then the other alternative should have be consider which be to make the watchman into an ordinary superhero team and give them an adventure to go on like the avenger or justice league quite frankly much as that would have be bastardization of the source material it would have be more entertaining than what we end up with all the slo mo action in the world could not smooth over the problem associate with book to film project like this but m sure thats how zack snyder and co sell the idea to the big wig only someone as young and inexperienced as snyder could have the ego to think that make movie like this and have it appeal to wide audience be realistic goal suspect he will be far more careful and michael bay like in choose his project in the future
do they come up with the character before the story it seem like in the conjuring 2 the writer just think monster in nun costume that seem really cool then when they try to build story around it they can get the square peg to fit in the round hole it a nun monastery in romania and demon call valak but why be he run around in nun costume that story doesn get develop enough good ghost story always have mystique and history but this movie doesn deliver in that aspect instead they seem just to rely on jump scare and cheap thrill
good movie make for young kid this movie be good like the set kid friendly act and it be very appropriate to bring child to go watch and reasonably entertain for an adult find yogi to be good facsimile and though will always prefer 2d animation think it be well do the plot be simple and easy enough to follow the 2 faced nature of the politician be good life lesson not to trust anyone who smile too much andrew daly as mayor brown be particularly well do and find him quite funny and evil felt tom cavanagh do fine as ranger smith and felt he be what you would expect someone who forgive easily and just want to concentrate on the park and not the money like it my 3 year old daughter like it and we have good time watch it would have no problem recommend it to other family
she like the wind this movie have stand the test of time jennifer grey and patrick swayze make movie magic with the sultry dance move the choreography and the music make this ride you will not want to get off of now consider cult classic it have spawn television series broadway production and most recently remake that be horrific fantastic piece of celluloid history that ought to be revisit every now and again
bad science in serious movie ever this movie attempt to be serious and it have good believable science in it but then they do thing that just make you want to scream at the writer if you be go to ask me for suspension of disbelief please be little consistent space ship take off from earth boost with three stage rocket about the size of saturn 5 rocket that same ship can then take off and reach orbit from two alien world with out any booster include one planet so far down gravity well that there be time dilation of one hour to 7 year at one point three ship be move away from black hole with no thrust but when the small ship separate from the large one they immediately fall back into the black hole there be 300 foot ocean swell on planet where the ocean be only 1 foot deep it seem like every time the writer want to add some plot device into the story they add new convenient constraint to their universe for example you can communicate normally in one direction through their worm hole but only few bit per day in the other direction our hero be an ex nasa pilot who even though hasn be in contact with nasa for 20 year be give the task of pilot their late ship hope anyone who take high school physic would feel insult by this movie
a grand masterpiece from bogdanovich the first frame of the picture start with song entitle it only paper moon and when the opening title come on screen the film felt reminiscent of woody allen film but in respect bogdanovich have go to extreme length of try to pay homage to the great film maestro orson welles would have to concur that the cinematography and the credit for the use of deep focus should be credit to james wong howe who start an experimental process as far back as 1925 since he be experiment with camera lens and light to make sequence stand out in the picture the film then go on to tell the story of bible salesman and just as he be make his sale with satisfactory customer he notice an adolescent girl that want to learn the trick of the trade in sell bible as part of con job one thing that will note that make this film grand masterpiece be the use of black and white cinematography popular song in the background as the film score the performance by ryan neal and his daughter tatum be superb as well as madeline kahn in an oscar nominated performance another positive aspect about this film be the direction that bogdanovich outlay from story character development and convey the feel and look of the era of the great depression saw this film nearly 4 to 5 year ago on dvd there be some con to this film that can make it bite problematic first be the length understand that the film be long and that when there be not much action your mind can not take the stress of too much dialogue sequence which be what felt whilst watch this movie also felt that some of the sequence like when ryan neal be out with the tatum neal in the middle of the town in texas be bit antiquated when she end up get lose and ryan have to search all over the area to find her but do have some positive thing to say about the camera angle and shot use in the film for the sequence when ryan neal be talk to the mechanic at train station if you look carefully at the far left of the screen of the open window right behind the man in the train station you can see two girl play out back in clear view it be distract and take the focus away from the story but it be pretty awesome to see something like that in film such as this like the film and it a story that have be use in modern film and tv show to provide inspiration like suite life of zack and cody when they re use the same story but to con the people in the hotel that what feel about this movie grand masterpiece from peter bogdanovich
beautiful but slightly disappointing saw kfp last night and when leave the theatre there be weird feeling in my stomach that feeling be disappointment due to the lack of laughter watch the entire movie with smile on my face so it be enjoyable but not hysterical never break out in laughter like do with other animated movie this movie have something special and that be the magnificent animation and the spectacular fight scene that will remind you of crouch tiger hide dragon and house of fly dagger go to see it with friend of mine and we both love movie afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re enjoy the best moment but you could have hear pin drop we couldn find anything to mention that be memorable to say besides our admiration for the beauty and eastern style the movie be craft in so in conclusion if you want to see an animated kungfu film kfp be great if you expect to see funny picture about panda do kungfu kfp be very mediocre
fairly mediocre film from pixar pixar be its own bad enemy they set the bar so high that it so hard for them to compete with themselves with that context this movie be good not great the majority of the movie be quest but the end have very emotional end that really save this movie
all that go wrong with the revenant it the oscar season hooray and everyone seem on the lookout for who deserve the ultimate hollywoodian honor and who be go to go home with gold uncle oscar ve be avidly follow the ceremony for year now but that doesn necessarily mean hold it in the high regard everybody know it all politics at the end of the day today go to the cinema to watch this year most talk about film alejandro gonzález iñárritu the revenant try so hard to ignore the two golden globe the 12 oscar nomination and the 8 3 imdb rating to cut thing short be immensely let down and here be my reason why 1 iñárritu be genius there be no doubt about it but genius be obviously not immune to over inflated ego the mexican director have become popular with film critic and moviegoer worldwide for his ability to make film that be both aesthetically and thematically stunning film that be so beautiful to look at and so touching you could easily relate to who would ever forget the heartbreaking reality of amores perros 2000 and babel 2006 and the surreal world of biutiful 2010 and birdman 2014 after those masterpiece the revenant look like sheer act of muscle flexing we get it iñárritu you can do magic with your camera you can take beautiful long shot you can make man bear fight look so goddam real you can film inexplicable gore and violence like no one have ever do before yet be bore to death because couldn feel the slight connection to anything or anyone the film come out visually outstanding but cinematically fragile because it lack the substance that should hold it together the entire plot be base on father son relationship that wasn develop enough or wasn develop at all for the viewer to emotionally connect with hugh glass the revenant which make me feel that the whole survival quest be bite on the absurd side 2 clichés clichés clichés the film be so rife with clichés actually think iñárritu be play some kind of joke on us die hard hero classic mindless villain dead pocahontas wise chief and of course some careless frenchies and don you think the clichés just stop at character level they run deep to include predictable plot and extremely bromidic line and dream sequence don mind that the story be cliché revenge story it the treatment that concern me the revenant be basically about man who waste two precious hour of our life look for another man who kill his son and leave him for dead and when he finally find him the evil man die word be revenge be no good the end that it swear if you can see something beyond that please feel free to contact me 3 don usually like to dwell on this point in my film review but the improbability of the event be pointless and so difficult to ignore so we have man who be fatally attack by grizzly bear almost smother to death shot at fall down waterfall and off cliff stabbed and beat hope didn forget anything yet he miraculously survive expect to see him in the next avenger movie 4 number four be not really shortcoming but disaster redeem the outstanding performance by all the cast member make up for the one dimensionality of the role they play domnhall gleeson and tom hardy hit all the right note with exceptional maturity even though think hardy texan accent be bit funny but maybe on purpose both be actually grow on me in speed of light dicaprio be amaze as usual but don think this be the performance he should get an oscar for do appreciate all the trouble and the physical pain he have to go through but compare with his other performance m sorry leo you can do much well anyways if he grab an oscar this year he would still deserve it retroactively the music and the sound edit in general be annoy would ve suffice with dicaprio incessant heavy breathing which be equally annoy to be honest go watch cast away instead if you have see it already watch it again it would still be more enjoyable experience

mostly well act but badly write and direct high review reveal how low expectation of audience be start very well be interested in the story of discovery but this be poorly write story beneath the quality of the actor in the film the pace be too slow after the beginning character development well act except for the lame and vastly overdramatize social message insert as the film go on with lily james character and her husband have the story concentrate on the history and the archaeological importance as well as how the basic character involve it deal with those issue it could have be good as soon as the obviously politically pander sexual element enter the film it become aggravate and foolish the relationship that be affect by this be not believable cheesy unbelievably melodramatic and the chemistry be just not there wish people could just write story without insert social and political propaganda and message such shame it could have be good
solid performance very little story will keep it short because the movie plot be so concise that you can not discuss it without give it away basically it 90 jake gyllenhaal play tightly wind weirdo who clearly seethe with rage just below the surface he be excellent at this but that be really the whole movie renee russo be also good but her role be very secondary as the info sheet on the movie say he become rove cameraman shoot crime scene and that about all that happen there be some scene that show the length he will go to to make it but that be about it there be purported moral lesson in the movie which boil down to all the american viewer want be blood and gut not news not exactly the big revelation so jake gyllenhaal be excellent renee russo be good too but barely in it so if full movie of jake gyllenhaal do wind too tightly psycho la anthony perkins be your idea of good movie this be for you
the 80 produce some excellent movie this be one of those film you should have see at least once in your life but realise part way in that haven actually see this though of course this ultimate chick flick be so very known it difficult not to feel you ve see it be surprise to see it set in the 60 i presume it be present day and be rather disappoint by what felt like lack of recreation of the era it just didn feel very 60 it not really necessary to detail the plot other than it really be boy meet girl the story be quite standard yet it do quite nicely and even delve into darker territory with abortion and the peril of promiscuity be sub plot the lead jennifer grey and patrick swayze work well together with swayze handsome lead and amazing to think he be 36 when he make this grey be nice as the innocent discover herself but do find her little too plain the film main element for me be the dance scenes an there plenty of dance to be have the lead be excellent dancer and the choreography and camera work be very good there be also good soundtrack the film have legion of massive fan and it be perhaps easy to see it quite classic story and over the year have spawn bad sequel and plethora of wannabe film as well as many skit parody and reference one of the film most massive line indeed moment be when at the hotel end of season show johnny come to get france and say nobody put baby in corner but be quite take aback at the delivery of this it seem really abrupt and almost do so quickly that if you weren pay attention you may have miss it still the end be quite rousing by the time everyone be up and dance and ultimately there a lot of fun and lot to enjoy in this light romantic drama more of review at my site iheartfilms weebly com

on so many different level this movie be stupendously awful kill your darling isn just one bad movie it five bad movie there be so many story it do not tell so many theme it can not explore so much overall phoniness and shallow ignorance of life the universe and everything it not move come of age story nor thoughtful analysis of allen ginsberg poetry nor an evocative film about the world war ii era nor chill crime drama even though the climax involve brutal stab nor stark uncompromising look at the danger of drug and alcohol abuse even though every single character be present as some kind of addict nor an honest and candid exploration of the social pressure of college life then or now there be at least five or six good movie you could have make with this material and instead they make this foul sewage as watch this movie keep wonder if be be unfair mean give how vile all the character be and how ugly and sad the end be could anyone have do well job but then think of the basketball diary base on the life of jim carroll star mark wahlberg and leonardo dicaprio ugly scene of drug abuse brutally real violence the emptiness of high education strip bare homosexuality right in your face it all there but in the basketball diaries the stake be much high these people really matter even the poetry sound well kill your darling could have be good movie but it wasn and by the way the beat movement be not club for gay men plenty of gay men hat the beat and plenty of beat hat gay men there be no love lose between truman capote and jack kerouac in fact truman capote famously say of kerouac on the road that not write that type it movie like this that give teenage homosexual murderer bad name
beautiful this film be the single most romantic film ve ever see it tackle their love in dream like way where everything go perfectly for them as it part of trilogy between these two lover this make sense it my personal favourite of the trilogy as its tone be brilliant and you feel like you be with them every step of the way thanks to the fantastic writing you get to not just watch these character fall in love but fall in love with these character it a brilliant brilliant love story
there be much good film about the holocaust yet another pretentious overblown meditation on serious subject by hollywood director that be how would sum up schindler list but maybe my view be skew by the fact that have actually see other movie that deal with this subject from enclos out of print to the pawnbroker the pawnbroker be devastate indictment of man inhumanity to man schindler list pale by comparison look at the detail of schindler list the movie open promisingly with wonderful assortment of authentic german cabaret song couple with black and white period scene mean to evoke the raciness and fun of berlin before the nazi rise to power all well and good but then the movie fall apart in its depiction of drunken debauch and undisciplined s concentration camp commander whose romp take place in cliff hanging house overlook the camp this be so far from the reality of what take place in the camp and the way they be organize as to be silly schindler rescue of the jew be decently portray but the movie go into overblown mode with its drawn out portrayal of the train approach the gate of auschwitz be there crash cymbal hundred violin play and trumpet fanfare to signify to the audience that this moment be tragic in case they hadn already figure that out don remember let just say that spielberg approach in this and some of his other movie be the very opposite of subtle now really have nothing against this movie otherwise it okay that all but m amaze at the adulation it be receive from an apparently uncritical cadre of adore fan turn the holocaust into what amount to soap opera and an ego trip for the director strike me as pathetic it seem that too many young director in spielberg generation be give gold star before they really deserve them not unlike kid in school today get s just for be you
stupefyingly dull fast company would be dull movie anyway but have be direct by the acclaim david cronenberg make it an inexplicable disappointment there be very little action and what action there be mostly elicits yawn either the sport of drag racing be uncinematic or cronenberg fails to make it cinematic the only big stunt at the very end be spoil by sloppy continuity the story be nothing worth mentioning and the long scene of people fix car and the even long scene of people get in and out of car or the scene of plane take off and land be mind numbingly dull it also shame that claudia jennings final film role turn out to be so insignificant even if you be cronenberg completist watch burt reynolds hooper instead it do this sort of thing much good 1 2 out of 4
outdated love film from another century stupid predictable and dull be three keywords that sum up ky mig well than most other word it a love film about two woman one be openly gay while the other be engage with man the only thing separate this plot from one million other love film be the two main character be homosexual while it great that main character have other sexual traction than just be straight it still doesn make this movie anything other than awful you can base movie simply on sexual orientation in 2011 like you could 15 year ago hope that more film will use homosexual transsexual and so on as main character but please don base the whole movie around it how could homosexuality ever be normalize if every homosexual character and also real life homosexual base solely on their sexuality
an amalgam of cliche if you re cinephile you ll see that every single plot aspect of this movie have be do and overdone hundred of time in the recent past the dialogue be incredibly unimpressive for the cast of actor as well as the for their character role within the film the predictable very linear plot continue to unimpress as it trudge towards more unoriginal development if you enjoy cheap action movie that attempt to have depth but end up shallow go for it if you re look for something fresh and unique avoid it it waste potential as usual
unforgettable this be the kind of film you don see too often it be truly visual masterpiece haven hear about this french director but mr nobody really blow my mind in all its image dream romance and complexity the movie have similarity to film by michel gondry but think this film be more magical dreamlike and existential film some might think mr nobody be too complex too demand it be not for everyone but love it like other surreal movie peter jackson the lovely bone and synechdohe new york dr parnassus micmacs these dreamlike and difficult film must be terribly expensive to produce and ask myself how can the company go through with these production these flick never generate big box office money im amaze that they still make this kind of demand visual movie for cinema and glad discover the greatness of jared leto as an actor when he play john lennon killer in chapter 23 that be truly disturbing and amazing acting of disturbed fanatic loner mr nobody be however the role of his life if you like this kind of movie recommend eternal sunshine of the spotless mind synechdohe new york and the fountain they really make you think
the only thing bad than nightcrawler be the coroner in the eye of victim nightcrawler be the kind of film that will catch audience by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness and feature the kind of lead character that will be discuss in film circle who don detest american cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt the film plunge us into the dark seedy world of nightcrawler somebody who often work freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule patrol the street of crowded city with multiple police scanner search for recently commit crime in the neighborhood like rape shooting murder car accident and so forth the object of nightcrawler be to get candid and intimate shot of the ugliness that plague these scenario as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news station or eyewitness program to turn quick profit job requirement include possible insomniac lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror exceptional navigational driving skill and load of free time jake gyllenhaal play lou bloom man at rock bottom living in los angeles sell scrap metal to get money before eventually turn to the nightcrawling business he team up with rick riz ahmed young man desperate to make money to keep roof over his head who help navigate lou route as nightcrawler and learns of numerous police code to help lou decipher the police scanner jargon together the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team turning profit by sell the footage expertly shot analyze and even occasionally manipulate by lou to nina rene russo the station manager of severely fail news station that be in dire need to regain viewership ultimately nightcrawler juggle two tricky but immerse feature with its material simultaneously give us look into grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who be essentially voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meet and pose frighten commentary on contemporary news the nightcrawler be not look to help or to provide encouragement he there to get his shot and move on hop to turn as large of profit as he can we see los angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as contemporary film noir in dark sometimes shadowy photography and dingy environment that reveal an ugliness to city that be normally capture as very beautiful and ideal in term of climate director dan gilroy and cinematographer robert elswit frequent collaborator of paul thomas anderson do everything in their power to subvert our idea of los angeles and focus on transitory location that show the ugly of human event in such way that be beautiful and captivate thanks to crystal clear photography the other feature nightcrawler toy with be the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethic and how with local cable news compete with so many twenty four hour news station who in turn be also battle more rapidly update social medium websites the manipulation of news be ever present on television news program like sitcom reality show and sport event be game of number and those number be rating something that nightcrawler make depressingly clear to us crucial scene to this message come into play when lou have shoot and sell the define tape of his career and have work to manipulate it for personal gain he watch as nina play the tape on the air direct the news anchor in such specific way in term of language and mannerism that we see the fear monger happen right before our eye on top of all the social commentary we see amazingly realistic crime scene and car accident to boot perhaps it the lack of intimacy many director lend to these situation often show car accident and character limp and trudge along with little bloodshed but nightcrawler detail these scene with an incredible eye for attention and realism gilroy make us the voyeur and give the window into these car accident that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see the attention to detail in these seem be simply exquisite and uncommonly believable nightcrawler in addition feature wonderful performance by gyllenhaal who like his co star paul dano in last year prisoner play detach and empty with such conviction and channel something of an inner philip seymour hoffman in own mahowny show his character complete fulfillment when obsess over his job and his work even riz ahmed shouldn be overlook here play the overworked and under appreciate assistant to gyllenhaal lou in role that could ve be an empty and even distract side role the entire project be rich in commentary performance and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete film of the year
in word disappointing when asses movie make from classic story usually go back to cartoon version of oliver twist where the producer writer and director decide it would make much good story if they add talk frog this wasn that bad give it 2 because it wasn that much good didn hate it as much as my 13 year old son but didn like it part of the problem be probably that we finish read the book this past week and the good story and adventure be still fresh in our mind there be problem that can overlook hobbit and dwarf grow and shrink from scene to scene there be gratuitous love scene add and saruman promote into the primary villain the simple bad guy be much less interesting than the scholar overwhelm by his subject etc but the thing that bother me the most and be really unforgivable be the terrible miscasting of elijah wood as frodo since wood seem to feel that act mean open your eye wide and whine it isn really that surprise that he the director and writer have turn one of the more appealing hero in literature into total wimp the more he whine the more disappointed get fear that frodo be in danger of be remember not as an average guy with problem and desire and thirst for adventure put into an extraordinary situation and prevail through his own grit brain and determination but as an ineffectual dweeb paralyze by situation beyond his control and cringing and whine his way towards his destiny
outrageous critic believe that so call critic of today have sense of entitlement to their opinion which be absolutely okay on one condition know your fact this film wasn too terrible and if you be not professional critic than you don have right to bash this movie for low budget canadian film it be quite entertaining to watch so what alot of the mechanical situation weren accurate it a movie movie be mean to be enjoy not to be closely examine of every aspect for example zombie aren real but there be still movie about them suppose you re go to say oh this movie be rubbish because zombie aren suppose to bite arm they eat brain people need to quit be tight and enjoy something fun for once
some episode be great some be terrible some episode have rewatched time and time again they be entertain intelligent and funny br br others be dull boring and some be very childish br br so would recommend watch this but be prepare for some garbage around the diamond
simply excellent be one of rare bread who have not hear or read much about this film be captivate from the start intensely surreal in the best traditional of the genre yet almost lyrical its setting in deep dark urban scotland glasgow augment the sublime darkness and dystopic undercurrent the plot be simple indeed survival this be quite special piece of cinema unlike any ve see before and far superior to all in its genre and beyond it certainly multi layer film and to merely categorise it as scifi mystery etc do it great disservice the ethereal façade ingeniously weave together and encompass the complexity of human experience the absolute ultimate vulnerability of magnificence to the shear brutality of base force in us all
pretty dull give it miss there be some decent acting by martin roach and rj mitte mostly and some really bad acting by some others overall its pretty boring and the dialogue be way too on the nose the camera work be decent but don understand the comment about the creepy mood it just scene in bar with two guy tell story with wee reveal at the end nothing earth shatter it feels little like prolonged telling of the hook hand escaped convict campfire story
it not good it merely okay when they go for dramatic fight scene it do well when it go for dramatic dialogue it fall flat no character seem worth care about too much just no depth to them like wesley snipe in blade he play that part well own it you could say none of these actor own their character at all okay to pass the time but when other than fight scene the act really sags and feel cold
nearly good like many of these big screen adaptation of cartoon this clearly have be labour of love they ve try to get the right people do the voice but sadly it doesn quite come off
beautiful this movie be perfectly film to demonstrate imperfection it use comedy not for laughter sake but for the emotional wellness of its character and the audience
out of focus and bore this movie start out well enough with amazing performance by ralph fiennes and carey mulligan but unfortunately it get bogged down by the introduction of various character and unnecessary and excessive focus on their relationship the relationship from those new character felt like they lack proper character development impact and be completely irrelevant to the dig and what be discover also the discovery itself end up be very disappointing and felt like it didn need movie make about it at all it would have be well if this movie focus much more on the relationship of edith and basil with everyone else to the side and the impact of the discovery on their life rather than the focus be all over the place with several others and their boring relationship
boring and unmoving didn hate the movie but don get why everyone think it so good there wasn any part of it where be emotionally touched and think it because the kid be too annoy for me to like it as person who doesn like child the old guy be sympathetic but can relate to him much as young person and those be all the character that there be
horrible bore dull bad movie possibly ever make can not believe this pile of trash receive any award the only reward it should have receive be raspberry right from the start the first minute be just awful and hurt to watch really close up of eye you call this brilliant cinema call it putrid boring trash who be entertain by this anyway this awful thing have no story no dialogue and no plot nothing woman run around pick up men to throw into mud that be the entire movie the only positive be the naked body of scarlett however she look awful be brunette do not watch this garbage do not believe these good review it will hurt your brain watching it
complete garbage this movie try to copy everything off of the skeleton key complete waste of time watch it really don get what all the hype be about
masterpiece dare any studio producer director to make today anything even close to that film
age be nothing for this film still incredible relevant this week watch the 1939 dramedy mr smith go to washington the logline read naive man be appoint to fill vacancy in the united state senate his plan promptly collide with political corruption but he doesn back down think the best part of watch this be realize that the battle of morality in place of power be nothing new this particular film although it may have have some funny moment be definitely more drama and less comedy as product of columbia picture it be very professionally do however to me the element that stand out the most be the writing and act the writing of this film be really well think out and be execute very well too there seem to be lot of study or knowledge of politics and lot of time spend in construct the plot sequence the right way in order to pull this off the acting be the next best part of this film obviously james stewart be in this film but jean arthur and guy kibbee really give some stellar performance overall think that this film even give its age be still relevant today enjoy it and will be share it with others
very bad film this film be as much of let down as the phantom menace be the story be dull and extremely unfocused the pacing be confuse m not sure if it the actor fault ford and allen or the director but they be both sleepwalk through the film and seem apathetic about everything just because this be direct by steven spielberg doesn mean it a good film this be ridiculous film with bore story to spice thing up the filmmaker add campy impossible stunt deadly waterfall and vine swinging to perhaps attempt to shock viewer into enjoy the film intermittently unlike the other indy film many of the set look like set to sum it all up the film be unfocused dull uninspired and lazy
overrate m sorry know this film be pretty high up in the top 250 film know it have an average vote of about 8 but just didn think it be all that good it be fill with supposedly touch voice over and the like but be completely unmoved by any of them the point where willem dafoe get kill though be laughable and only serve to turn the film into some sort of gung ho farce all in all the acting be reasonably good however and the direction be good with some of the action scene be very confuse and imagine all the more realistic for it all in all not the movie it be make out to be still think bear on the fourth of july be stones best vietnam effort
have its moment but nothing great this be decent movie with funny concept but it could have be so much good if it do away with he really blizzard part and just stick to the theme of lazy slacker in over his head the whole plot line with julianne moore as some weird bizarre sex artist should have be cut her acting be just bad there too many scene in the bowling alley with john goodman take over the scene with his loud brash presence forget phillip seymour hoffman be in this but it might be bad performance ever hes nothing like the actor he would become and it be disappoint watch him in this but there be some funny scene and it be nice see tara reid young and beautiful before she turn into drunk train wreck the movie definitely an acquire taste

an average big budget action flick be very interested in see this movie after the tim burton kind of batman movie be not real batfan don know much about the comic book and just expect to see great fantasy movie with interesting character burton movie be great knew that it will be darker now but it be much more bore it an average big budget action flick the writer and the director have no idea about superhero we get an average action hero of the nicholas cage steven seagal type in bat suit however haven see the dark knight movie with heath ledger yet and still hope that it will be more exciting see my comment there
bothersome and dull to begin with tried like this film but it be something about it that just couldn get past be it the typical internet billionaire treatment be it the god like personification of the billionaire be it the reclusive typical approach to the billionaire or be it more than that well it be all of that and more there be this winner of some internet competition who go to the billionaire house and interact with an artificial intelligence now keep in mind that he and the billionaire be suppose to be genius well he interact with the i and refer to it as her and as people it be not it be machine an appliance from there it all down hill because now he give it empathy as if it be live person instead of treat it as machine he continue on in this vain which inevitably lead to his and the billionaire demise quite frankly we ve see this scenario in other film way to often with this hackneyed trope and why would you want to stay in house that doesn have any fail safe device or manual override at the end just didn care about what happen to them because they deserve it and just didn care for this film even with the nudity
full of nostalgia bound to make new fan as well when the box office figure for the us come in this weekend be absolutely horrified sure expect be legend to do well but the amount that alvin and the chipmunk get 40 million seem absurd add to that the fact that it have earn more than golden compass do in its opening weekend just seem ludicrous the trailer have see seem very mediocre and wasn look forward to see it that much so what surprise and delightful one to say how much really enjoy the movie sure its kid movie through and through and if you re not into talk animal then you will come out of this movie and criticise its plot script and usual more adult thing that critic criticise about but if you go in willing to sit back and enjoy the movie you will realise there be lot to enjoy the three lead themselves alvin simon and theodore if you ve never see the chipmunk before be all very likable and have some hilarious moment the movie feature consistent humour that range from fart joke for kid to some really subtle reference most notably one to die hard where for one moment think alvin be go to complete his yipee kiyay moment and make the parent gasp in horror he doesn so don get too excite the script itself be pretty decent there be the obligatory clunky sentimental bit but generally the movie be consistent and full of laugh it do outstay its welcome admittedly and feel that little bit too long but these be mere quibble as this be movie that be bind to entertain many kid and adult alike and the fact this do good than golden compass no longer frustrate me as this be admittedly much good movie than golden compass the three lead of the movie be cgi creation they be also surprisingly voice by justin long alvin matthew gray gubler simon and jesse mccartney theodore though you never know as obviously their voice have be morph so they sound much more like the chimpunks anyway their voice sound perfect theodore be the most distinct and will make many audience world wide sit their and go awww alvin be great lead and have some brilliant moment simon be the most dull of the three but have some pretty funny moment as well but its when the three start sing the movie just come to life the chimpunks christmas song definitely give the old member of the audience to relish in and their rendition of funky town be by far the highlight of the movie the actual adult cast themselves be pretty decent jason lee from my name be earl be decent enough lead and at least do good than the adult actor in garfield who seem almost asleep when the sentimental stuff kick in admittedly he do stumble little bit but generally lee be on top form and definitely isn always overshadow by the chipmunk david cross do the traditional villain role pretty well although he do start to irritate after while and when he go into pure evil mode later on in the film he just seem bit silly but by far the bad character in the movie have to be claire play by cameron richardson she be out of place in this movie and the romance thing never play off at all where alvin and the chimpmunks succeed where movie such as garfield and scooby doo have fail be the fact it succeed in the comedy department sure the movie have its nostalgia factor but if it wasn funny then the movie would be disaster thankfully this be very funny movie the fart joke be obviously aim at kid but thankfully there aren that many of them in fact when you compare this to something like garfield you realise how well the scriptwriter have do keep this to minimum slapstick be obviously big part but do very well and there be many set piece that will please audience the song as have say be definitely the highlight and as ve say before the funky town rendition be just pitch perfect there be many one liner to be find as well amongst amongst some of the clunkers that appear later on the sentimental scene also be not as horrific as some more recent family movie have be in fact some of the scene generally do warm your heart overall alvin and the chimpunks be surprisingly good movie that be definitely something parent should take their kid to see this christmas while maybe not as good as enchant this be definitely well than golden compass and kid will lap this up so the obligatory sequel that will arrive seem perhaps more joyful event then it seem before saw this movie in fact sequel now seem quite decent idea
inevitably everybody will watch the watchman unfortunately have to argue that it doesn deserve all the attention now love the watchman comic book it be piece of literature that should be treasure like most classic honestly go into it think this movie would result in one of two end train wreck or eternal glory the outcome this movie be train whose journey to eternal glory be cut short due to lack of key locomotive part but not wreck see the story play out on screen be excite and frustrate witness all the miss element of the book be too much distraction keep me away from feel fulfil others in my group new to the story felt it be confuse not have enough emphasis on transition between past and present though it do have some stunning visuals and wild although unnecessarily brutal action that od ed on slo mo personally this movie seem like an audience pleaser like they take the most stirring emotional comic book tale and numb it down enough to give people something to clap at this be evident when reader of the book will notice the story big event unfold with little emotional response like they be gloss over or witness from the window of pass train shame could have be great 2 thing have to be say the make up and music be the bad in cinematic history the music be just inappropriate and awkward for the moment they be attach to surgically remove your connection to the film every time tune strike up but the make up my god the awful make up so many people giggle at the ridiculous face of richard nixon and the elder silk spectre almost as many as those giggle at dr manhattan glowing blue well you ll see everybody will see it no matter what the movie deserve you can fight the inevitable hype right now people be too excite and they want this movie to be good so much they win invest any stock in the bad review otherwise we wouldn ever have to suffer through transformer 2 once think alan moore be crazy for not want anyone to interpret his work into movie form saw from hell think nothing of it saw the league of extraordinary gentleman and think yea they should leave his stuff alone then for vendetta and switch side maybe it can be do now with watchman just respect the man wish and don mess up his stuff its too intricate and too precise for it to be dilute with someone else interpretation
it ok well they get the basic right the joke and the violence be quite what d expect when see one of my favorite comicbook character come to life have lot of fun and the movie have the audience roar with laughter more than once however the story and the way the other character be portray couldn keep up with that it felt like they put in so much effort to make deadpool really really deadpool ish that they forget how crazy insane his usual story line be and just use superhero movie template to make something up be disappoint by most character too apart from dp only colossus to my surprise and blind al seem to have some substance over all d recommend see it but keep your expectation low and just enjoy the fun

haunt narrative structure nothing more memento be fairly ordinary nothing earth shatter about it the slight story boil down to man be manipulate left and right because of his disability short term memory loss the tattoo idea be hard to swallow and there a big storyline goof in the film during the w scene when guy pearce relate the story about another couple with the husband suffer from short term memory lose think now what be the chance of have two men suffer from stml in one movie think about this during the first part of the movie and pretty much figure out that what be go to happen in the remainder of the film memento only have three main character so see the old couple in the w flashbacks dramatically reinforce the fact that few real people populate the landscape and with the main character act from disability and revenge when the main character of story seek revenge it always misguide revenge the other two character natalie and the cop manipulating guy well there aren that many likeable people around to care for all of this could have be save if the performance have be great but alas they re simply okay nothing spectacular there very little emotional core to this movie no gravity the scene occur one right after the other with none of them be more memorable than the next memento have seamless blandness to it when rivet scene and stylized action be in order hitchcock would have do so much more with this story likeable or interesting character for starter and load of stylized filmmaking this film be in desperate need of but if there one aspect where memento succeed be how it linger in the mind its ultimate creation be that of totally distorted world and in the end seem to be what the director want to achieve you might not enjoy memento while watch it you might even find it trite and convolute but like its main character you ll be leave with fragment of image and distorted time frame week after you ve see it memento be much good when one think about it afterwards than while watch it
rumor have it well be definitely not the target audience for this movie but be sure that any teenage girl who ever felt out of place felt like an outcast or ever have any kind of trouble in high school will relate to this movie or at least part of it the movie be straight forward and very easy to understand and it portray the character in way that you can easily get into the movie and sympathize for the character and hat off to emma stone for her performance in the movie she be simply put quite good in this movie and also thomas haden church bring lot of color and depth to the movie with his role as do amanda bynes with her role have think this movie to be another funny teenage comedy but boy be wrong this be far from be just another pointless teen comedy with cheap laugh and shallow punch line obviously the movie be direct at teenage girl but think the movie do bring something out to the viewer regardless of sex age and such the whole movie be build up around rumor how they start how they spread and how they affect the people involve and it do so in good manner and be the hollywood movie that it be of course it have sassy end not spoil it here by say how it end but trust me you will see it come mile away if you like me saw this movie with the hope of it be comedy you will be disappointed sure there be moment that have comedy value but not enough to actually make you laugh out loud or enough to be label comedy as per se there be deep mean to this movie and you will appreciate that fully if you be teenage girl in high school or if you be teenage girl in high school in the past not bad movie at all just wish have know what it be about prior to see it and would have have some type of head up on it

pure entertainment what else do you need hi all where it may be debatable whether this movie need to be make or not have to say only one thing to all those critic out there bad mouth this film get real this picture be brilliantly make be hugely entertaining and visually as well as sound wise stun this picture be make to entertain people not to be analyze by wan na be physicist that probably don let their kid watch tom jerry because it unrealistic listen folk all kid aside what be you after when you watch rent movie you want to be entertain and that what you will be 100 sure there ton of cgi but that the age we live in almost all movie be cgi laden monster but that doesn stop them from be successful please don be put off by comment you hear or read on this film it be worth the money and the scene at the end of the film with kong on the empire state building watch this on my home theater screen 10 foot across with the city far far below be simply dizzy my hand be sweat so go and enjoy this film it ll make for very enjoyable 3 hour that all we want right
why do everyone think this be so great it par with pixar maybe come in with too high of expectation but know m not the only one who think that this movie wasn so great it be just ok it have funny line all of which be already show in the preview and pretty good plot and great animation but just don see why so many people think this be such an awesome movie there be no adult humor at all so maybe all the rating be from parent or child don know think the 3d version must be whole different movie than the one saw because walk out think it be just mediocre here some advise do not watch it if it not in 3d you ll probably be disappoint as well
one time watch for sure but not die hard thing thought of watch the film after read somewhere that it be rare thought provoking film and should have be oscar entry in its time well they should have send the film for the oscar because at least it be something much good than what be send at that time but the film be disappoint one heard that it be some of the very critically acclaim one but do not feel it so the film be not able to explain the very essence of what the director want to convey all the time it be true that the film really portray what actually happen in the real life but thing should have be twist little to suit up the situation the most shocking part for me be when it become clear that after be survive from the police siddharth kay kay menon leave everything and start to learn medicine mean what about all the principle from the start he be think of very great idea but in the end it become clear that his wife be much more mature than him other flaw the the film would include be no character analysis can be do by the viewer the character of shiny ahuja seem to be bit of selfish in the beginning but in the end he be the one to suffer the most that be ok but what be the need of introduce all his marriage with that girl whose name also do not remember now just to lengthen thing up many character be be put the father of vikram shiney ahuja be on entirely different philosophy which be good to see but nothing be clear as to what their progress be either they should not have show at all about him or if intend it should have be much more analysis the only character that seem to be very well suit in the role and be impressive be the character of geetha chitrangada she seem to be one of those actress who know how well to suit into character like in yeh saali zindagi it be relief to see him do her part properly kay kay menon be impressive as usual
disappoint always have high hope when watch any movie of ben affleck may be because he have do such amazing movie before you always expect more from him and set high standard for his movie but this be complete miss like batman v superman don know how he accept movie which be so average mean what the hell happen to his standard or he must have forget to read the whole script anyway the movie be slow pace thriller although you can say wan na be thriller which make you hooked till the end of the movie end be where the movie completely fall apart and it leave you disappointed and steal you of your time and expectation for this movie all the good acting directing and hard work be go to trash you keep say to your self be this actually the end and you check your watch to know that 90 minute have pass yes it leave you want something more to happen but in the end it leave you disappoint this could have be great movie but the end kill it somehow feel this be similar to the town at least the first 85 minute so ben the next time you do choose movie read the script especially the end
the film would have fall flat if not for the effort of reynolds and jackson there be time when the buddy movie formula rule the hollywood cinematic universe we love the brashness of such film as lethal weapon or 48 hour but then the formula fizzle out and filmmaker move to other thing to cite an obvious example the nice guy 2016 star such acting heavyweight as russell crowe and ryan gosling be smartly set in the 70s but despite its okay plot and superb acting by both crowe and gosling wasn a big box office hit the hit man bodyguard look like great idea on paper bring together ryan reynolds fresh off the boat from his profanity ridden deadpool and samuel jackson who be know for his on screen cussing and wait for the firework to start as the duo at first go all out to murder each other and then develop mutual respect that border on friendship and for most part director patrick hughes of the expendables 3 fame get it right the best scene in the film be when reynolds and jackson be piss each other off reynolds doesn roll off expletive like he do in deadpool but jackson do go over the top reynolds smartly play the straight guy to jackson more gregarious character and it work the plot of the film be explain in its title itself reynolds be down on his luck private security agent who be cajole by his girlfriend elodie yung an interpol agent into make sure an ace hit man samuel jackson reach the international court at hague alive to testify against an evil dictator of belarus which be an actual country by the by the creepy dictator be play by gary oldman who get to ham to his heart content now the bodyguard and the assassin have history it reveal that jackson try to kill reynolds some 28 time in the past so one can see that their relationship isn go to be easy in fact they start of by try to kill each other and only jackson injury prevents him from kill his would be bodyguard the rest of film be devote to the banter between them and how they defuse the tension and reach their goal the film chief flaw be that director hughes just doesn get the tone right instead of concentrate on make buddy movie with smattering of violence he go for the overkill pile up body by the dozen at every action set piece then there be couple of gory scene as well that jar gary oldman execute the wife and child of rebel in cold blood and reynolds be torture through electric shock in graphic manner the action scene too don have fluid intensity that we have come to expect from hollywood blockbuster then while we get that reynolds motif for help his ex be to get her back there be too few scene between him and yung to get the chemistry go compare to that the scene between jackson and his wife play by salma hayek be epic she out cuss him in scene set in jail and we see nice montage of her fight off guy in bar and jackson mooning over her as she use the jagged edge of beer bottle to open up man neck that love at first sight serve with gothic twist the film would have fall flat if not for the effort of reynolds and jackson we can see they be enjoy work with each other and it their camaraderie plus some crazy as dialogue that save the day watch the film if you be ryan reynolds and samuel jackson fan watch midnight run instead if you want to watch real buddy movie
heath ledger if someone else act as joker would give the movie 7 8 star the majority of people end up love the villain more than the hero and that rarely happends in movie rest in peace heath ledger

not the best showcase for cotillard considerable talent marion cotillard be one of the most lovely actress currently work and she struggle hard to make something of this blah film but her talent be mostly waste the immigrant start promisingly but it not long before the film begin to sag under the weight of dull pacing and relentlessly somber tone joaquin phoenix ratchet up the ick factor to play man who take advantage of recently emigrate woman and with whom cotillard character strike up queasy relationship not so much because she like him but because he the only thing resemble protector she have in an unfamiliar world jeremy renner be welcome presence as rival for cotillard affection but he have far too little screen time and leave the film too early phoenix be absolutely repulsive to look at as usual and listen to with his mush mouth line reading and his unpleasantness overwhelms the film and everything in it include cotillard handsome production value and some good moment tantalize the audience with what might have be under more dynamic direction and with different lead man
have plenty of action and humor throughout this film involve several different american agency compete against each other for various reason to get their hand on replica of s treasury plate along with 1 billion in counterfeit cash which be soon be carry out of baghdad and head to germany for sale to the high bidder work for the department of defense the team consist of their leader john hannibal smith liam neeson templeton faceman peck bradley cooper ba baracus quinton jackson and certifiably insane pilot by the name of howl mad murdock sharlto copley although hannibal believe that the the member of the team be the only one capable of retrieve the fake treasury plate they be order by dci captain charissa soto jessica biel to stay out of the mission which have be give instead to clandestine organization name black forest even so cia agent name lynch patrick wilson informs hannibal that black forest can not be trust and pressure hannibal to get them at all cost need permission hannibal pleads with his superior general morrison gerald ramey who reluctantly give him the go ahead thing get quite dicey after that now rather than reveal any more of the movie and risk spoil it for those who haven see it will just say that this movie have plenty of action and humor throughout and while the action and special effect be quite extensive think it be the humor that keep this from be simply run of the mill action film especially like the performance of sharlto copley who think be quite hilarious additionally have pretty actress like jessica biel certainly didn hurt the film either even so think the director joe carnahan go bit overboard on the action and because of that have rat it accordingly slightly above average

al pacino great act brightens this controversial biography when first saw the hbo logo at the begin thought crap this make for tv movie be pleasantly surprise by the cinematography absolutely blow away by al pacino portrayal of jack kevorkian the subject matter weigh the movie down however and no matter what side of the controversy you find yourself on the scenario be grave though personally haven decide whether euthanasia be morally right or wrong you don know jack will have me root for kevorkian as be take alongside him in his thinking and what seem to me to genuine empathy for his patient after you see this film you will know jack and it just might change what you think of him or even what you think about euthanasia

excuse me who like the movie but find it very bore the big short in my opinion be the bad movie of the nominee in oscar find boring movie with slow pace and moment try to be funny more do not work at least for me the cast be strong point of the film christian bale steve carell ryan gosling brad pitt john magaro karen gilian melissa leo marisa tomei and have rapid participation of selena gomes and other margot robbie that and fri and very good the direction of adam mckay reasonable find very similar film with the wolf wall street the script be good the big short in my opinion not work in humor the performance be even good plus the pace and slow the movie be kind of bore with time and dull and unnecessary besides be much like the wolf wall street which be very good plus the script of the film be even good plus my view adam mckay could not use well the good script have note 5 6
not masterpiece but entertain af like say it not masterpiece and it certainly have some problem but the movie know exactly what it need to be and what it need to do and it do it well statham johnson ilba and the rest of the cast all do pretty good the action be over the top but entertaining and exit the movie be also pretty self aware and wasn as arrogant as the other f movie and love the choice to make f movie with such bizarre and over the top plot at some point the movie get little to repetitive and cliche for me and some of the joke and skit be little bit weak than others but like say this movie be not the one make to be masterpiece or to be analyse for message or deep mean its just dumb summer movie but really good one at that
gim me back that oscar hi first want to state that be resident of the netherlands so please forgive me for any inaccurate sentence or whatever the thing want to state here be this movie be big hype its not worth the oscar because the story in the big line be just boring and not innovative at all maybe it all look nice because the coen bros have get nice reputation and they all shoot it with nice atmospheric effect of course there be some nice scene which make you hold your breath as if you be one of the partaker in the movie praise for that but on the general side this movie be not worth the big hype it receive right now gim me back that oscar if you like the coen bros you good just keep on watch your copy of fargo over and over again that movie be worth much more the while fargo at least have an interesting story and challenging plot for many of us none such in ncfom its just like nice violent roadmovie guess but expect lot more from this maybe in the current field of dull and uninspired big feat movie release ncfom might look like something new and spectacular but most probably we still have to wait some more before the next movie arrive that really blow our mind
lack personality while find the action and story decently please overall think the movie spread itself incredibly thin in term of characterization and as such suffers from distinct lack of personality understand that marvel think they could forego character development because each character have their own movie with the exception of the hulk as this version be reboot think that there need to be lot more go on in order for the character to be likable all of the dialogue be either puns one liner or witticism as if the movie be one big joke and the actor be constantly wink at the audience the action and story be please and well think out but the character be completely lack
boring and depress with couple good laugh mix in will say that this movie do make me laugh out loud quite few time there be some great observational humor that capture the eccentricity of the human mind or cat as can be see in the credit but overall find the movie to be pretty boring and depress to start with there be basically no story or development of any of the character riley move to new town and the five emotion in her head have to figure out how to find balance happiness after the move the problem be that the whole movie be base around 5 character joy disgust anger sadness and fear all of whom be stagnant and kind of annoy most of the story take place in the control room of riley brain and it appear that the animator be extremely lazy or uncreative when decide what the room should look like it be basically an empty purple bubble with computer in the middle consider this room be the scene for about half the movie m surprise they didn try to make it little more exciting on top of this the movie be very depressing and not in good cry kind of way but in grow up suck you be go to be unhappy for the rest of your life kind of way despite the fact that joy be the leader of riley emotional control team we constantly see sadness who should have be call depression constantly pull riley down into the pit of useless apathetic despair on top of this we see that the leader of mom and dad emotional control team be sadness and anger respectively oh the joy of be an adult over the course of the movie riley memory go from those of mostly childlike happiness to the bittersweet jade memory of an adult it seem that adult in the world pixar create can no longer feel pure joy their emotion be always ting with hint of anger sadness or disgust maybe this be true for lot of people but think kid should enjoy their blissful naive ignorance for as long as possible would not bring your kid to this movie unless you feel the need to forewarn them of the depressing future they have to look forward to

nightmare for tolkien fan who read the book in the 60s be assuredly in the minority when state jackson lord of the ring trilogy be some of the bad film make have ever see it would appear that he and his production team read the book sort of maybe 30 year ago buy the cliff note and from that write the screenplay to illustrate my pov recommend listen to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produce by the bbc record believe in 1981 jackson and crew err when they depend too much on computer fx and spend too much time on the spectacle of combat and war often think be watch slasher movie what make the original trilogy compelling be the relationship and the subtext character carry with them from begin to end to be sure there be mythic battle both large and small but they come out of very carefully craft relationship and deep well of subtext don quarrel with the new zealand location do quarrel with the dumpy look set that be haphazardly gloss over with computer grafx fix don quarrel with the casting except frodo and yet find the direction so superficial and often perplex if not simply muddled galadriel as an english vamp clue to my dissatisfaction can be find in the omission of tom bombadil the only character in the original not affect by the ring his eccentric wisdom and unexplained power grind the plot because there be something someone who be outside the dark lord power there be in the tolkien universe power unimaginable which sauron can not touch and that be essential to the fabric which hold middle earth together which tolkien in his craft and his wisdom know he have to give expression to and jackson in his foolhardiness ignore why didn jackson team follow the book with more trust the master have already work it out perfectly well almost the trilogy wasn long enough which tolkien realize after its completion nevertheless the project would have be immensely improve have jackson and his team lay out six episode franchise to match the six book of the trilogy take more time to film it in their excellent location of choice and above all truly pay homage to its original creator by follow his work faithfully these film be mish mash which titillate the mass for brief time and that be tragic because it will be long long before someone will be able to do them justice

professional but derivative and dull if you have see serpico scarface and the french connection you don need to see american gangster ridley scott new biopic unfortunately show how group of stunningly talented craftsman can create an uninspiring lackluster and by the number piece of cinema certainly there be good moment there be nice verbal face off between crowe and washington ala heat but its appeal lie more in the power of its star than in the power of the story never be there moment when be unaware that be watch crowe and denzel the film make much of the fact that this be true story about powerful black gangster whereas other mafia ish crime story usually feature italian while this may have be an interesting counterpoint the point be only dealt with in show that the distinction be irrelevant denzel can be just as powerful crime lord as the rest so where the drama crowe character be yet another in long line of movie cop who be womanizer and bad father husband and yet the most honest cop on the force this never change throughout the piece where the drama none of this be to say that scott and company fail at present the authenticity of the world and it character the production design be flawless the characterization seem to be right on the money and the music recall hip time authenticity however do not always translate into dynamic and exciting story tell there be no surprise no real twist and the inevitable fall of washington character and thus his organization be anti climactic worth watch if its free
ruin by it last half hour this be an exciting chase suspense character movie until about the half way mark at that point too much be go on all of it similar and all of it almost beyond comprehension there seem to an endless supply of mexican drug runner be to kill where they come from with whom they be affiliate what they be try to do be all insufficiently explicate if at all the end of the movie be imho just disintegration as if all the money or film stock run out some attempt be make to present the point that this film be an existential exercise show what would call nickle and dime existentialism yeah yeah we re all go to die evil exists life be coin toss this philosophizing didn help

sam peckinpah best violence ballet steve mcqueen and sam peckinpah team to do two straight film probably some of the best work in both of their career but the difference in nice character study like junior bonner and tough crime drama like the getaway show the versatility of both these remarkable men the getaway seem to take its inspiration from john huston classic the asphalt jungle mcqueen be career criminal whose parole have once again be deny in the ten year stretch he do wife ali mcgraw submits to parole board chief ben johnson sexual advance to spring mcqueen but the corrupt johnson isn just about sexual harassment he want mcqueen to rob bank that his brother be director to cover nice case of embezzlement he even recruit another pair of criminal bo hopkins and al lettieri as part of the gang of course the plan go wrong as bank guard be kill and then hopkins be kill in double cross by lettieri who then fail to do the same to mcqueen and mcgraw after that it a three way race to the border between johnson men lettieri and mcqueen al lettieri be talent that be lose to us way too soon he play some of the best villain in the early seventy and this one be one of them he kidnap veterinarian jack dodson and his slut of wife sally struthers soon she more than willing to go and be his girl struthers have great part so far from be gloria bunker stivic on all in the family my favorite sam peckinpah moment in all of his film be that climax at dub taylor flea bag hotel where all the force meet and shoot up the place it peckinpah best violence ballet in all of his film never tire of see it the whole film be shoot in texas and m not sure how resident of texas might like this picture of their state it seem to be one very violent place and very corrupt one as well but like the getaway very much it my favorite sam peckinpah film next to ride the high country
entirely mediocre have absolutely no idea why people rate this movie as highly as they do not only be pearce act altogether wooden the try level here be so over the top and self conscious it pathetic try to be suspenseful try to be smart try to keep your attention but utterly failing at every point by minute 30 of this sorry film my mind have already be wander for 20 minute in fact didn even finish this movie skip to the last five minute just to see how it would end and again find myself yawn what bore self important piece if there ever be one do yourself favour and skip it
this movie be very hard to digest watch enjoy appreciate recommend watch the movie against my best judgment to stop watching in the middle but want to since it be hard to digest scarlett act in movie with full nudity which would not make sense it be very frustrating try to make sense perhaps should have read review by other people before watch this movie after read few review on imdb must say it be definitely not for simple people who want entertainment for their buck in spite of it be sci fi thriller it be not like specie or predator or remotely close who be these alien why do they come to earth why they kill people with no remorse or emotion that also only male why they do what they do these be few simple question want to find answer while watch entire movie the movie be very slow and bore to point where just want someone to fast forward but apparently it be not about alien but about our society may be alien be also try to find the answer to similar question about us why we do what we do few utter bore point bike be drive around with no music scarlet walk on desert road with no music scarlet drive around for quite some time in van with minimal or no music scarlet invite guy inside house in repetitive mannerit seem movie be unnecessarily be stretch scenic beauty of scotland be pretty good no doubt about that but movie be not about that entire movie could have be sum up in maximum of half an hour at the end of movie be very tired while try to make sense out of it be ready to give 0 star for waste my time completely but then there be part of it very interest when alien be in shock and give up human form over all will not recommend anyone watch this movie unless you be very philosophical and wouldn mind exercise your brain which might turn out to be futile at the end
questionable moral and intent at best it be well make well acted movie be just not sure that it give perspective that be need for one never doubt that hitler be human be don feel enrich by the experience of actually see him be human be on screen be sure that the movie be accurate enough and it certainly be convincingly realistic it force no viewpoint pass no judgment and it be for the main part confound to the bunker and event there and that be part of the problem for me in way perhaps we can assume that everyone know the fact of what have go on outside and it be hard to make movie show all side it be already 2 5 hr long but by limit the action to the bunker all we see be people under extreme stress what be the point of that we do not explore what the action of the people have bring onto everyone else we be simply deal with human reaction when their world collapse it be clear that hitler at least by the time he be in the bunker be derange it be clear that most of his follower be equally derange in their devotion to the fuhrer it be also clear that some of his top official lie to him and yet others do not all be human human human so what do anyone actually ever doubt it it be an interesting movie that deal with real event and how people react under extreme stress but do not need to see these people under extreme stress if all there be to it be their plight and that be what the movie be about have problem with that
ll take what behind door number three gene boatload of people run into technical difficulty and be force to dock on strange island where the dead be hear scream they join up with some survivor run from the zombie hordes infest the island it seem that some odd year ago the island be research center where the world top scientist gather to defeat man bad enemy death but during the experiment it seem that the scientist try to cure young girl disease and end up kill her instead unfortunately for them her big bad voodoo daddy take it personally and open the third doorway to hell one girl survive the zombie onslaught and now as woman must unlock the secret that will close the gate to hell the script in the end be way too disjoint it seem that whenever the scriptwriter come up with something he would just half hazardly throw it in and hope for the best the action adventure element be nice touch and keep the pace flow nicely as what seem to be common factor in italian zombie movie we get soft focus look that to me be quite annoy at time add to the mix rather lush jungle at time choke and blind fog and synth score that owe great deal to john carpenter and you get above average but rather plain and sometimes funny zombie flick the makeup effect aren anything to write home about but the zombie be relatively intelligent they even shoot and talk and chew the scenery with mucho gusto
mornay sauce rebecca de mornay can be fascinate beautiful actress but as for the part she give to play if you can not say something nice de mornay portrays woman who have terrible trauma as child with father she can hardly stand now that she a grow up and have become of course brilliant shrink she have an affair with banderas whom we suspect of be ouch how original serial killer sometimes she recall banderas mother in law tippi hedren character in marnie but wouldn count on it hitchcock die twenty four year ago and lot of regent desperately try to replace him here the director pull out all the stop to make thriller with an unexpected end but that end be so far fetched it be absolutely impossible to buy it the movie include the obligatory conversation with serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murder human being and cat split personality and open end in case the crowd should call for more apparently they do not and they be right
over rat film making have improve over the year and this film be choppy like death wish alot of 70 film appear grainy compare to the work do today this film drag maybe it be the mood be in but it drag find it slow pace and not over the top in the end this be just another movie 5 10
slow descent into madness as someone who simply enjoy movie without call myself critic m not sure really get the lighthouse and m not sure be suppose to on technical level this be objectively very good film some kind of old or vintage film must have be use in shoot because the movie be display at least on the amazon prime video player in very strange aspect ratio this couple with the black and white cinematography and the use of lamp to light night scene give the film unique stylistic touch speaking of the amazon player think this movie be hurt by it in part the compression artifact make some scene look like garbage so if you can watch this on bluray or download uncompressed version then that will likely make the film look way well on your screen the acting be superb dafoe and pattinson get the only speaking role in the movie and when get the chance to flex their acting chop and oh man they do they play the whole gambit from awkward acquaintance to drunken friend to bloodthirsty psychopath what impress me the most be the accent they pull out both dafoe and pattinson have to each nail their own individual esoteric and weird regional dialect and to my surprise never notice them slip up or change accent on any word dafoe be 19th century sailor and pattinson be maine farmer from start to finish their performance be what tie together and sell this movie as total package the plot be something else entirely though the story of the lighthouse be about two men who find themselves slowly lose sanity as they take care of the lighthouse over day and week at the start of the film the sound and shot be standard and would say beautiful the island look good and the lighthouse be quaint however as the movie progress the style of the film start to get more and more erratic and surreal without give away the plot thing really start to fall apart and the style of the movie match what be go on in the plot in its final moment the lighthouse one climactic moment reach an apex where the whole movie go insane cinematography sound design plot act everything it all reach surreal zeitgeist if more artistic and surreal thriller movie be your jam then the lighthouse will be 10 for you for me and think many other viewer the appeal of the lighthouse to other viewer will leave you confuse and jar but entertain nonetheless

i couldn stop smile not once through the whole movie that be except when be laugh out loud the movie be more than that though it give us some philosophical and even metaphysical potentiality to think about yes always lead to something good be the presupposition offer to the protagonist true statement but trick assertion if one believe everything lead to something good let your yea be yea and your nay be nay mean either way lead to something good just be clear about what you want its be shifty and or indecisive that lead to confusion and disharmony yet think this be just the kind of movie that will get people think differently get people to act apart from habit to see what happen and get people experiment with life this be when we truly live and dare say this be when we begin to have faith
a waste of time it hard to decide which be bad montgomery tully inept wait for the grade pause direction or his incredibly ramble disjoint screenplay spin out from stage play by falkland cary with its compendium of dialogue clichés the music scorer have try vainly to give the film pace and atmosphere but be largely defeat by the heavy hand of mr tully and his cast of largely flat foot second rate player in fact it a shame to find fine actress like kay callard mix up if only briefly in this woefully extend quota quickie patricia roc and roland culver be usually feature in much good film too normally bottom of the barrel effort like the hypnotist don waste more than an hour of picturegoer time but this one be spin out to an incredible 92 minute at some stage the producer have mercy on cinema patron and shorten the movie to 73 minute but and my brother big city critic be force to sit through the full length version production value be negligible

shallow unintelligent and pretentious quentin tarantino seem to concentrate his movie very much along the line of quot cool quot and quot tough quot and pulpy storyline and character to me his script come across as do by someone who read too many grade comic book mainly because his movie have very similar content br br the story be very thin and to sum up the what you see on the screen most of the time there 39 a bunch of cookie cutter emotionally retard tough guy who compete over who can deliver the coolest and toughest line to each other and wave their shiny gun at each other with the right sort of swagger that sort of thing be just so ho hum clichéd and juvenile that felt like tune out right away br br mix into this macho posturing be some gratuitious violence even to the point of be repulsive at time for example when mr blonde get his way with the cop and couple of quot cool quot story in the vein of pulp fiction 39 story about mcdonald 39 in france what depth too bad it 39 pretty much gloss over content the only flash of intelligence in this movie be right at the beginning where mr pink deliver his speech on tip that 39 what keep me somewhat interest at first unfortunately it be all downhill from there br br this sort of movie doesn 39 appeal to me at all although 39 sure it have some appeal to teenager who consider the like of _the fast and the furious_ to be quot cool quot me guess 39 just too old 27 to be impress by this sort of trashy stuff have see it ten year ago my review then might have be somewhat different

sheer drivel the genesis of this film be jonathan demme be harass by the gay lobby after the depiction of the serial killer in the silence of the lamb the payback be to make sympathetic portrayal of gay man with aid btw the same lobby try to bully mel gibson after his portrayal of the effeminate prince in braveheart but mel be too much of man to be bully this film be extremely preachy and politically correct as someone note earlier the heterosexual white men be the evil crucifiers of the gay guy and who come to the rescue the black guy puhleeese the gay party scene be pretty sicken and by the way why doesn hank partner have the virus notice that the glaad people have post like crazy that this be the best film since citizen kane also notice all the usual hollywood lefty or should say fellow traveler particpated in this film joanne woodward tom hank mary steenburgen bruce springsteen guess ed asner mike farrell and jane fonda weren available demme should stop the politics and get back to entertain people as the b mayer say if you want to send message go to western union ll give 3 mostly due to hank performance
cinematic approach and gyllenhaal performance not enough to save this debacle although visually grip at time nightcrawler lack any real depth in story character development tone and believability gyllenhaal portrayal of sociopath lou bloom be pleasantly eerie and worthy of recognition by audience however lou be not your typical anti hero in that he have no redeeming quality and therefore we can not root for him or feel any empathy lou be somewhat destitute in act 1 petty thief who scrap by his big break come when he be able to steal bike and barter it for video camera soon he discover hidden talent the ability to successfully arrive at accident scene before other nightcrawler and film gory footage he sell his footage the only way he know how by bombard local news station and convince nina the news director during the graveyard shift play by rene russo that his work be truly art and worth air time and this be one sloppy metaphor and or commentary on current broadcast journalism that nightcrawler try to hammer into your head we have lose any semblance of decency as tv view nation that capture video of accident victim bleed or die be fascinate and see as art rather than tragedy from here lou business expands and he hire rick an unemployed uninteresting guy with zero skill to be his intern this be all we need to know about rick to push the story along the filmmaker decide to use an 80s style montage during which lou and rick buy fancier equipment new car and develop an increased passion in nightcrawling though their business be expand lou continue to freelance and sell his footage to nina and only nina by directly hand her his video in person feel like this be write to be make in the late 1980s the film aim to be tense and story drive instead they interject comedy at inopportune moment and lose real chance to delve deeper into potentially fascinating character study the writing be sloppy and the character be one dimensional lou ability to interfere with active crime scene google search license plate and cut the brake of rival van tire and lazy movie trope be all too convenient and without any conflict not stylistically aesthetic enough to be strictly visual movie such as the ryan gosling film drive nightcrawler just fail to deliver any story or message of substance
crystal clear economic specific brilliant that should be enough to sing the praise of work of art but in the post there be more much more we can ignore the fact impose by the historical moment we re live right now the press under attack belittle insult but not ignore no never that steven spielberg put everything at the service of the story and the magic stroke be meryl streep she create real life woman again after margaret thatcher julia child lindy chamberlain and once again she create fully fledge human be and this time she play woman without known voice until she find it and when she do she use it m absolutely transfixed and move very move by her performance

hmmm just saw david cronenberg cosmopolis and have no idea what to think of it cosmopolis be advertise as be almost unwatchable because of its literary dna e there be too many word in it and the unity of place since the story take place inside limousine well it be almost unwatchable but for entirely different reason the limousine sequence be actually very dynamic and beautifully shot and word be wonderful thing to have in film as long as you use them well the problem be the movie doesn seem to find the right word the writing be insipid uninspired and cosmopolis doesn have much to say on its important subject matter m not even sure if the movie be pro or against capitalism benno levin wonderful cameo appearance by paul giamatti be even more repulsive and unlikeable than the young packer cosmopolis be not complete failure though there be several strike visual moment the music of howard shore and metric be brilliant and pattinson dazzle good look be put to great use here but the final result be simply not good enough
should have get oscar contention and jeremy renner just kill it the immigrant james gray new film while retain some of the gritty dark crime dramatics of his previous work feel like radical departure mainly because its an elli island era period movie set 100 year ago and because its observe through the eye of female protagonist and her struggle against permanent blight and the inherent depression of the situational time flee the brutality of trotsky red army polish ewa marion cotillard and her sickly sister arrive in new york cira 1920 when her sister be quarantine and both be threaten with deportation ewa be take notice and save by the faux sensitive brothell pimp bruno joaquin phoenix and blackmail into prostitution just when ewa may succumb to the sort of drab bleak life that she be try to allude bruno cousin orlando the magician jeremy renner show up and both men via their own quirky method try to light fire in the heart of the pretty foreigner in her best part since rust and bone cotillard be oscar worthy in showy albeit poetic performance make all the more impressive that she speak polish throughout most of it phoenix be superb as usual as the repressed and impotent man who want to think he in charge but renner steal the show right when you think the movie be go to slide under the weight of the misery of its subject his orlando appear like glow gaslight of fun amongst the dim room and crowd corridor like his work in american hustle its criminal that his spritely performance here will go unrewarded and under the radar although the universal tale of gray film isn exactly something we haven see before from kazan bold america america to ron howard putrid far and away the immigrant present rare and thoughtful experience one in which we can learn something about the life of long ago as well as our own
not what expect as someone who love showgirl and have see it at least once year for the past few decade this documentary about the film be interest but bit too dry for me some of the background comment by critic seem to completely miss the mark and also find it bite confuse that they decide to add so many random scene from verhoeven film do think showgirl be an entertaining masterpiece but this documentary isn all that entertain and would have like more behind the scene footage it have it pluses point out how verhoeven take on the film have change over time and the negative way it impact elizabeth berkley career but could have do without the side stories concern the people who have be affect by it worth watch if you love showgirl but as fan of the movie be disappointed
hello hollywood this be the kind of stuff somebody think up on the toilet there be nothing remarkable about this film besides how disgust it be can not help but think more subtle approach would have help this movie avoid the banality of the special effect which seem more suited for science fiction due to their over exaggeration the story be overly contrive the director handle this movie in such way that the narrative jerk from one scene to the next yanking us to punchling serve as climax something so obvious and derivative be not worth watch overall felt the movie be very disengaging and fundamentally simplistic in narrative the character be cliché and find the general atmosphere of the film undesirable
overrate several people recommend this film to me and be look forward to watch it but be disappoint for start find it difficult to take the hero seriously that wasn william wallace fight english tyranny it be mel gibson the film have make in hollywood stamp all over it take crowd please liberty with the historical truth crowd please liberty can be forgive sometimes but these be just so well corny be the word that spring to mind good battle scene though and the evil king play good part but wouldn watch it again
many enjoy it but you may not watch this movie with some friend at the cinema long time ago and m review it now because ad on tv about the sequel jog my memory can see now that curse of the black pearl be very popular among imdb member especially among female and young people if you be young female you be much more likely to think you enjoy this movie than if you be an old man that what the demographic breakup statistic say remember be very disappointed with this film and one reason why be disappoint be because it be so long remember get up at the end of the film and because the film be so long my butt be ache as if someone have jab needle in it be not averse to long movie but this one in particular be just not at all entertain the first reason for this lack of entertainment think be the behavior of the character johnny depp character be deliberately crazy if one of my friend be to act like that in real life would stare at him and after some time would ask him man what be wrong with you in this movie be consistent with my behavior and badly want to ask johnny depp character what be with the crazy behavior but of course depp be just act and obviously can talk to the character through the theater screen so that just leave me feel frustrate most of the movie be fill with humor that didn find funny at all but many in the audience obviously think it be very funny as with the depp character the humor be just crazy and weird but of course humor be very subjective so it a matter of taste suppose another issue d like to bring up be the fight scene which think be very disappointing as well the reason be because they be very plain usually in fight scene like to see something coherent want the camera to stay and want the fight participant to engage in intense suspenseful but also aesthetically please fight the fight scene in this film don have that elegance bunch of people just get together and the camera cut and shake as if we re look at everything from the perspective of drunk man the plot be another sorry part of the movie that woman as you can see m not good with name be your typical annoy pretentious woman and at the end when she kiss the guy actually say out aloud in the theater oh please how clichéd can you get it like fairy tale your parent might read to you as kid

have its bad good and great moment the matrix revolution be be the high anticipated trilogy finale behind return of the king and by the time that revolution roll around people have grow disappoint of reload while others cherish the philosophy embellish sequel personally be one of the latter here be why enjoyed revolution and why rat revolution an 8 10 let start with the acting and small but pertinent synopsis keanu reeve reprise his role as neo yes keanu reef be extraordinarily wooden for this role but that be because he have to be the character of neo have lose everything by the time that the movie roles to conclusion neo do not bear emotion after certain loss during the course of the film and the film conclude with neo fight himself however himself be represent by hugo weave agent smith by the time that the two clash in arguably the great fight scene of 2003 neo have lose everything and have no idea that it be simply his will push him forward small spoiler even that do not hold through to the end while neo have strip himself of everything and every emotion agent smith have grow exponentially more powerful and begin to show sign of anger and even lust for more something that his character lack in the timespan of the first film or even the exposition of smith in the second carrie anne moss trinity like neo have lose much faith in the war itself but on the other hand have gain so much faith for her significant other that she be willing to give anything and everything for him carrie anne moss be able to show that strong compassion for neo without overkilling the role this be war mind you and its not wise to be on your knee tell your partner how much you care laurence fishburne morpheus be again the strong and again my favorite character in the film although this time his dialogue be no longer riddle with philosophical jabber and he have now be reduce to one of three captain try to make his way home before it face an untimely destruction now speak of which we have the epic siege of zion quarter million cephalopod resemble machine be augering their way into the last free human domain and what the audience be treat to be something that both blow us away and at the same time something that we expect with reload over extended action scene what hurt the battle be that we lose touch with neo and trinity over the course of quarter hour which leave the audience wonder two thing when the story between the pair resume where be they and or who care the battle do give us little insight on some lesser elaborate character although not enough to make us like them or care for them captain mifune and kid be the two main battle character but the female zee and her rocket wielding partner charra be supporter some people may like this while others do not the character don really matter during this battle the battle matter let talk about the battle itself it be mention in the first set up in the second and shove in our face for the finale saw revolution twice on open day once in an imax theater and must say there be moment when the battle scene in revolution make me forget that be hold my breath something that the war in return of the king didn manage to do the siege of zion quickly become an exposion of live action very little and cgi 13 of the 17 minute action where the humanistic machine of combustion engine and machine gun square off against the machinistic module of doom that bear dozen of tentacle and laser to boot in nutshell say that return of the king have the best battle sequence of 2003 but only because revolution break us in for it see two hundred and fifty thousand squirming and swarm sentinel against the seventy human gun walk tank be sight to behold wow wow wow now that the good thing be aside although didn make much mention to the final fight scene let talk about what hurt revolution the most its the poorly construct script and the characterization within them morpheus as mention earlier be no longer philosophy spout genius but be simply worried and frighten captain neo have somehow change slightly from the fall action of reload he now know the question he need to ask the oracle trinity doesn show the compassion that be felt in reloaded although her final scene do bring tear to my eye and the only character who we seem to know inside out from the last film and who have change only because of what happen in the last film be the french merovingian who be my second favorite character the prodigal child return be you here for the bounty seraph agent smith have the bad line in the film when the excremental feces hit the fan for neo be stand here right here m suppose to say something yeah something with little more substance and the trainman thing be horrible waste of time that doesn really tie into the last film at all and the script really doesn help it there the oracle be the only character besides merovingian who bring continuity to this flick in term of the script as trilogy only star war and lord of the ring be more epic in size and grandeur as pair of sequel reload and revolution be great but seem disconnect from the original somehow as its own film revolution deserve the 6 3 rating give to it by imdb com user by be judge it on how well its meld into and finish this trilogy which it do damn well no one can be tell what the matrix trilogy be they have to see it for themselves and that be the only way to fully enjoy these three as trilogy it be the best seven hour you can spend watch science fiction

frothy fun aside from some gratuitous topless scene and few double entendres gas pump girl be surprisingly sweet little film about five teenage girl their boyfriend and goofy motorcycle gang take on the big bad pyramid petroleum company in beautiful downtown sacramento the talent of old timer huntz hall joe ross and mike mazurki be sadly waste but the film manage to provide 90 minute of relatively painless entertainment even the wretched original song work in the post grease context of this low budget musical comedy ooo wah ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah your mother be an ooo wah indeed
overrate this movie be good but don know that it deserve the slew of oscar nomination it receive it certainly wasn good because of brad pitt he have one of the least expressive face in show business and it be difficult to actually believe he be feel any of the emotion the script call for another liability of this film be its length most of which be spend show the title character bounce around apparently try to find himself which make sense give his circumstance but it be very superficial treatment finally his age process be not actually linear neither forward nor backwards so an already implausible premise become even more difficult to buy into m glad saw it but it be not the spectacular film people would have you believe
update schlock if you like the movie the covenant which be about teen come into his super power while fall in love with brainy yet implausibly beautiful girl who spend most of the film stand agog at what he can do then you probably will not like be number four for the simple reason that you be no longer 13 year old girl and this movie be almost direct remake the film start out demonstrate how cool the main character be by show him do various trick on jet ski while maintain perfect hair half expect one of his friend to shout radical but then remember that this be not make in the mid 1980s from there it pretty much degenerate into checklist of crappy movie clichés brood teen try to fit in even though his power cause him to be different check generic bully not realize who they re mess with and get their comeuppance check bad guy use girl to get to main character yup love for the girl give the hero new strength to continue even though all look hopeless double check if you re look for movie you can turn off your brain and enjoy then recommend rent one of the xmen movie if you be girl who have just enter her teen and be tire of movie about whiny vampire then you might enjoy this but don expect to remember it week later

it a guy movie say my wife my wife and saw up in 3d last night just us 2 adult no kid we have see most of the animated feature in recent year and like most of them think up be decent not great but ok my wife hat it agree with pretty much everything negative that have be say on this board about the movie but haven see mention the thing that bother my wife the most there be no female character past the first few minute the only female human even in the movie be elie very briefly as tomboyish child in the very begin then as an adult in short silent montage so by 5 minute in it all guy guess the bird be female but that fact be so far from obvious that she get name kevin by the little boy maybe some of the dog be female too but you couldn tell didn even notice the lack of female energy until my wife point it out but it true and think it contribute an overall imbalanced feel of the movie as for the 3d think the scenery be very nicely do but the overall use of 3d be more subtle than many other 3d movie don remember any come out at you shots at all most of the 3d image be at or behind the screen rather than in front of it think this may be why many have comment that they didn even notice the 3d also there be too many flat scene that might as well have not be in 3d such as long closeup of item in scrapbook and long segment of black and white old newsreel style footage on tv screen so ll average my 7 opinion with my wife 1 and say 4 out of 10

i ve see well episode okay consider myself die hard simpson junkie ever since got cheese off that they interrupt an episode the one where mr burn hit bart with his car as recall with the news that the first persian gulf war have start m also apparently one of the few people who doesn think that the show suck now though do agree it not as consistent since about season 8 or so really there be only maybe dozen episode or so that truly detest unfortunately if the simpson movie be an episode of the tv show it would probably make 13 on my list the plot evil epa put springfield under dome because of the toxicity of its lake be just ridiculous homer and marge have marital difficulty sorry that be do just about to death ah yes homer in tsm homer be at his quintessential moronic bad pretty much for the duration his antic of adopt pig against the family wish and dump the piggy poop in the lake cause the pollution and aforementioned epa reaction to the point where you just want to shoot him and love homer can forgive him almost anything but in the movie his stunt be just annoy and that be my big complaint sure there a good amount of typical simpson political tweaking such as lisa an irritate truth seminar an obvious parody of al gore but be as the whole premise of the plot be so over the top found myself merely smirk rather than lmao which be my usual response to the subversive humour find on the show understand the producer bring together the best of the show writers to write the movie could have fool me and consider that they probably have big enough budget notice more then few lapse in the animation especially in the scene where the whole town of springfield have form yet another lynch mob to go after homer for few brief second you can tell that it be cgi 3d rather than normal animation find myself go tsk tsk at this shabby production all tell be very disappointed grant be not expect last exit to springfield caliber greatness with the simpson movie think we all know good than that but be expect it to be good than it be and ultimately d be tempt to put the final product in the ballpark of the principal and the pauper which even the show writer and voice actor consider one of the bad episode in the end d say the simpson movie be worth see once but can only hope that they do well with the inevitable simpson movie ii
finally real family film what cast ben stiller owen wilson robin williams dick vandyke mickey roney bill cobbs m not stiller fan but in this one he be really great he step out of his usual shtick to really anchor this movie for once he doesn seem to be try too hard and avoids overdo it this be one of robin williams well modern role he tone down but still quintessentially williams it be nice to see him in role that he can both take seriously and have some fun with it owen wilson be still awesome basically reprise his shanghai noon character but with cute rather unexpected twist dick van dyke mickey rooney and bill cobbs be classic they haven lose step rooney be still the little bantam rooster with the attitude van dyke clearly anchor the trio cobbs wasn give much to work with for his character but his quality shine through these veteran comedic actor bring bit of class and legitimacy to the film the movie be well paced jump almost directly into the action with plenty of laugh from rexie puppy dog antic to the war between old west cowboy and roman centurians there be something around every corner the only stinker in this film be the kid he totally under utilize for the storyline they could have improve the storyline by either leave the kid out of the movie entirely or by give him something to do the pseudo love interest too should have either be play up or leave out this be an entirely enjoyable family film my 87 year old grandmother in law love it as do my 9 year old daughter and my teenage son truly something for everyone
indiana jones and the straight to video clone like many young boy in the eighty love the indiana jones movie and therefore could happily sit through and enjoy many of the various copy hollywood churn out while try to cash in on the genre king solomon mine be great fun and believe it or not didn even know they release sequel until stumble across it in 2020 maybe that be the major problem ve wait too late to watch it and therefore can only really see the flaw as oppose to view it through child nostalgic eye the main cast from king solomon mine return e richard chamberlain and sharon stone to head off on another adventure into the jungle to rescue someone lose there and of course stumble on the lost city of gold there nothing too original in the plot but then you could probably say that about most of the far superior indiana jones film it just not that good even compare to its own predecessor the cast be decent enough the two lead obviously have degree of on screen chemistry leave over the the original and they re join by the always watchable james earl jones and few others that you probably win really have heard of the location be nice and if you can forgive the blatant green screen special effect then you can appreciate how hard they ve try however despite the cast and overall look of the film appear nice what let it down be simply the pace the character just sort of wander from one vaguely dangerous encounter after another they sort of amble through each one while various extra and non essential player be kill off until they finally reach their destination part of me expect it to end there and then but it sort of wanders aimlessly on add yet more and more seemingly random scene as if try desperately to come across as epic whereas it just fill time with action because it doesn really have much of story ve see that this film be actually quite highly regard by many others so m guess most of them watch this film when they be young and have fond memory of it reckon that if do too would agree sadly just find it strain and bore even the music seem to annoy me after while as it didn really fit the scene it be score stick to indiana jones or the original king solomon mine
not very funny or exciting or interesting be excite to see this film give the hype over how funny it be irreverent to super hero movie and interestingly adult love story it be it be none of these the character be annoy the plot be not suspenseful and the dialog be mostly child like potty and sex humor the only love story be between lustful superhero and stripper they only reason they love each other be because no one else would or could since they be despicable some of the scene be so disrespect to human life have to close my eye and turn my head to stop from get sick notice that some people leave the movie perhaps this movie be not make for people like me what find most disappointing and confuse be how disconnected the story be the super hero and the villain be so powerful at some time and then at other time they be kill with one measly bullet or punch will give it some credit for the graphic sound effect costume and animation keep want to like it but in the end leave unsatisfied
make remake of planet of the ape look good obviously much young crowd write these review absolutely no premium be put on direction acting or storyline it all about animation action and noise everything that need to be say about this film have already be say it be remarkable exercise in film technology but oh so long and oh so tedious after jurassic park one never think would weary of too many dinosaur but here actually find myself anxiously anticipate the return to new york like naomi watt at first but then peter jackson stop direct her and she become totally predictable everyone else seem to be freelance and what of the native what be they white people in black face who be they refugees from king solomon mine relative of that guy who have file his teeth and turn himself into lizard refer to the discovery channel very strange kong also look as if he be about 175 year old no wonder he only look at naomi that all he can do
powerful and overwhelming image and face the life of capeverdian immigrant in lisbon portugal the plot story be not conspicuously remarkable and we only become aware of it through the character conversation it be about their real problem the character be not proffessional actor and just immigrant themselves but they do very good job rather interesting movie well act and direct

about as historically accurate as inglourious basterds m not just hater here to hate be massive queen fan and have be as long as can remember the problem with this film be it simply isn the story of queen without go into detail that would spoil the film for any of those who haven see it almost nothing that happen in the movie actually happen to the band and freddie love queen and love freddie mercury but be truly disgust at the way this film brand itself on preserve queen legacy when all it do be stuff falsehood into fictional retelling of the band history if you like this film as film that one thing but it be in no way shape nor form the story of queen hopefully sacha baron cohen will someday get the chance to make the historically accurate account of freddie he hop to make in the meantime guess we ll just have to deal with this disney style nonsense
it just doesn know what it be all five of the star give it go to hugo weave for make the best out of bad situation this movie have multiple personality jump from thrill to slap stick in heartbeat which be probably because the man who take on the massive project have never direct anything before and it show lot the dialogue be well bad it embarrass at time actually the mask wear the whole time along with the hair cut be down right creepy and while the creepiness decrease as the movie chug along it never really go away vfv have me roll my eye at more than one point raise my eyebrow once and almost laugh about three time if you can take hero who show cook egg in pink apron seriously then you might be able to get through this
why all the negative review my wife and enjoy it be entertain and that be all that matter if there be bad act do not see it yes there be thousand movie with the same story line but all movie be the same different time different place different actor also seem to me that lot of reviewer have very negative attitude to everything find within ten minute of watch film can tell if be go to entertain me and turn it off if it do not why sit through movie if you do not like it and then criticise it strange
a huge let down if you have tell me five year ago that one of my most anticipated movie of 2018 would be title the nun would ve be very surprised it be though have be look forward to this movie ever since it be announce m huge fan of both of the conjuring movie but have admittedly not love either of the two annabelle spin offs be very pleased to see james wan be attach to the write side of thing on this one though and so hold out high hope for it sadly though have to report this be another complete misfire start with the positive though the movie look great the set decoration be truly terrific in nearly every scene and the building and surround area that the film be set in be ideally select the groundwork be there for this to be very creepy movie at time the movie do work too but that be mainly when it be be subtle there be lot of scene where image of the nun be sort of there but also sort of not you question yourself whether you be actually see what you think you be really liked that side of thing too often though the film be far too in your face the demon will jump out of tree and scream into character face very lion like and un scary scream would have to say as well the dialogue in this film be real mess too which surprise me consider wan involvement the character of frenchie be particularly painful he be mean to be the comic relief but nothing he say be in any way funny and be frankly little embarrassing in part also some of the thing the demon say like the village will be miss its idiot tomorrow or something to that effect be cringe worthy and should never have make the final cut be very let down by this film there be lot of jump scare and not one of them give me the slight jolt my heart rate never rise above rest in any scene and be frankly bore for the most part the only saving grace be that the film look great connect in with the rest of the series well and have truly great final scene that leave me little blown away didn want this to have to be negative review but there be no other way to go about it
very good but not excellent this be movie that have never see completely until recently have really high expectation for chinatown from what have hear and read about this film be that it be as good or good than other 1970s movie such as the godfather the conversation the sting or taxi driver think this be very good movie but not an excellent movie and definitely not as good as the francis ford coppola movie of this time chinatown seem bit slow and long to me do like jack nicolson performance however but his act along with the good directing wasn enough for me to call it an excellent movie the performance of the other actor be good but didn think it be great ll watch this movie again in few month maybe then ll feel more highly about it rate this movie generous 7 out of 10 be think of rating it 6
one of the great film of all time star war have be dethrone although george lucas movie be good in their own right except for the juvenile elements he put in to sell toy to finance the franchise his script which borrow heavily from r tolkien mythology religion can compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy the lord of the ring grant lucas take on herculean task in write direct his story himself but tolkien word along with peter jackson faithful adaptation inspire vision have create something no one man could equal of course it help that jackson insist on at least 2 picture deal new line cinema be brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movie they spend 180 million to film all 3 simultaneously with the new zealand exchange rate that equal 360 million 90 million ea but since they use many of the same set and fx development cost be spread throughout we re see 120 150 million on the screen this will ensure consistency in plot cast tone etc in 3 hour jackson have cram everything essential from the first novel then some into the film rewrite some scene dialogue with less character for the lead leave out only what there wasn enough time for basically you have two 90 min movie run back to back there be no slow spot just one climax after another from the opening 10 min backstory where the dark lord sauron be show on the battlefield wipe out men elves 10 at time with each swing of his mace be blow away the romance between aragorn king in exile and arwen daughter of the elf lord be play up for the titanic quotient but it well do the story set costume fx be so rich you ll have to see the film several time to absorb everything the unspoiled new zealand locale be spectacular provide variety of environment to represent the different setting on the character journey the location set be imaginative detailed weather add to their believability while the studio set match them in meticulousness the costume be at once familiar strange draw on both the medievil the fantastic but more important they re also functional practical the music by howard shore be appropriately sweeping celtic folky in keep with the novel although it lack the memorable theme of john williams or jerry goldsmith but neither would commit year or more to 3 picture project the fx be as they should be unobtrusive unnoticed most of the time there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most hollywood movie which try to coverup illogical plot bad act m particularly gratify by the casting of viggo mortenson as aragorn which be last minute stroke of luck when the actor first choose for the part back out due to difference with the director ve always think mortenson have an intensity strike but not pretty boy look that could portray flaw dangerous hero instead of the villain hollywood always pick him for stellar cast give some of their best performance visuals that deliver beyond what imagine perfect mix of humor passion tragedy and feeling of grandeur scope impend doom perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many character the inability to concentrate on any one it can be measure against some of the classic character study film but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the idea not get lose as far as m concern it one of the great film of all time
great movie maybe too intense for small kid this be great film pixar have do it again in silly serious very fun way the animation be top notch agree with other poster that the scenery be extremely well do the color be magnificent especially the sunset in paris make you want to move there right now there be several laugh out loud moment and even couple that brought tear to my eye however 39 glad pre screen it before bring my four year old there be some scene that be too intense for her to handle on the big screen will definitely purchase the dvd but will not be bring her to the theatre oh and that cartoon before the movie be gut bust what fun
no just no completely unbelievable just bad decide d go ahead and stream the first two episodes we re snow in right now so have plenty of time m sorry waste the time it just not even worth watch the fighting be unbelievable and be obviously fake it like bad movie queen latifah be an awesome actor but this role be too contrived for her she doesn come across as former secret squirrel type and just not convince it just bit of downer because she always do good job be certainly expect this reimagining of the series to have some of the same feel as the original but it just too forced it just try too hard to make everything fit and like say it all feel too contrived don see it get the rating it ll require to be renew
perhaps the best movie of all time m huge charles mcgraw fan every film he have large part in he excel and make the film well have see this film 4 or 5 time my respect for it have grow over the year the cinematography isn perfect the film probably could have benefit by stay dark and grainy as it seem to be in the early night scenes the taut train scene seem too bright but there nothing wrong with it simply my preference darker train would have make for more sinister film even so there plenty of excitement the crackle dialogue between charles mcgraw and marie windsor be consistently sharp seriously you will have hard time find anything more bitter than those two m not sure any other male female could have make the dialogue which in 1950 way be almost corny come off so terse as they continuously bark at each other someone need to count the number of time mcgraw tell windsor to shut up the film have some exciting twist and turn you ll enjoy each one great story solid performance all the way around this be fun movie
this be must see haunting and think provoke tale with some excellent act thrown in the mix have to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it when widow father of two interrupt his two son sleep with shock revelation they be torn between believe him and not as the horrify event of this tale unfold we learn lot about the father about his two son and about their destiny with shock twist after shock twist this film never allow for lull in the plot bill paxton play the father but the most notable performance be that of his old son fenton play by matthew leary and his young son adam play by jeremy sumpter this be one of the best thriller that have see in while and you will want to watch this few time to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot give this film 9 10
it entertain my eye but not my brain the good review be come from people who like the amazing talent in the movie the movie itself if you like watch actor drive around in car this movie be for you the movie plod along the dialogue plod along the action be jokey
watchable thanks to cruise and diaz it be while since movie have so heavily rely on the charismatic pairing of its lead couple to rake in the crowd chance be you win see this because the action in the trailer hook you in but rather because you re interested to see if these two wan hollywood heavyweight can still produce the magic they clearly have in their heyday well ve get some good news and some bad news the good news be that this potentially dynamic duo actually have splendid chemistry their effortless banter be natural and humorous as if they ve be share the screen together for year cruise be especially electric as he confidently offer tongue in cheek performance that isn afraid to mock his large than thou action star persona where expect him to turn one way he unflinchingly opt for path number two and take his unhinged spy to place didn previously consider diaz isn quite as thrilling in her role june be much more stock standard routine however she provide the ideal counterpart for the cruiser and indeed bounce off him with ease she look whole lot well in swimwear too now for the bad news everything surround cruise and diaz be dreadful and mean everything for starter the plot have more hole in it than sonny car in the godfather not just small gap that be accept as necessary to facilitate the addition of really cool scene but rather large and mindless crack that be form because of lazy screen write then there be the strangely uninspired and bland turn by the otherwise terrific sarsgaard the an education actor doesn appear to want to be there mumble and fumble his dialogue with woodenness wouldn have think in his repertoire bad of all though be the surprisingly shonky special effect that accompany the already average action with an estimated budget of over 100m be it too much to hope for realistic computer and practical effect it not even cgi dominate film where the flaw can be spot without difficulty it basic age old technique like background matting that fail miserably here every time we re watch people in vehicle which be lot it plain as day that they re on sound stage somewhere in a sitting in front of green screen can even start to explain how dire the effect be for the bull run set piece which feature our protagonist on motor bike watchable thanks to cruise and diaz but they deserve much well platform to prove they still have what it take in tinseltown
i can see how some like the movie but think it be bore wife drag me to see it because of all the oscar buzz the story do not interest me as be not into royality can see how many think it be good move but the story line be not interest it be well make movie don get me wrong just have problem with what it be about it seem to drag on forever guy if your wife drag you to this movie go see it do beat other chick flick yes put this in chick flick category unless your nerdy guy folk that like to show everyone they be smart will love this movie they can then discuss all the issue he go through king of hard for me to feel sorry for king even though the movie want you too if you want to be entertain this be not your movie if you want to learn something pick up book or research the net
a great little film from the 80 an enjoyable little film that might not be as well know as it should one of the reason saw this film be because some of the cast include pamela springsteen where in this film and that spark my interest at first everyone tell me this film be not go to be very good good thing didnt listen to them because this film be one of the good teen comedy from the late 80 before start with the review m go to summarise the plot for those that havent see it auggie and his pal drew graduate from college and now have to find job draw cousin sam own run down gas station that be the target of wrangler bob for one of his new fast food joint instead of sell auggie take out loan so they can turn the gas station into fast food joint of their own auggie spike the secret sauce with powerful aphrodisiac after that hilarity ensue thats all m say for the rest you must see the film for yourself now for my review unlike the summary this do contain spoiler you have be warn don listen to critic this be really funny film eact actor in the film give great performance the direction from micheal simpson be great and thinkg simpson could have be big director but the thing that he do aint that bad either the film do get bite bogged down in end with the courtroom scene and never quite pick up after that but since the film about over anyway its minor flaw my favourite part of the film be when they catar sorority party and unleash the burger on the crowd the party consist of stuck of rich kid and my favourite actress pamela springsteen not much of review but thats my thought on the fillm it be bit hard to find have to purchase it online but if you can find it definitely recommend see it
a different opinion come into this movie hop d like it hear from other reviewer say it be great but others dislike it however be part of the latter m go to try my best to write this review without any spoiler even though there one moment that make my sister walk out of the theater in anger and make me nearly scream this review be come from someone who have watch 2 superman movie 8 and half season of smallville and season of lois and clark think have knowledge of the original source material first off ll discus what make up most of the movie the fight scenes the only indicator to tell what the hell be go on be that superman be wear blue and the villain be wear grey it be also shaky and the city look absolutely ugly with the grey and brown color everywhere also superman sometimes doesn seem to care about people within the city dying as result of the fight now the act amy adam be very bland lois her connection with canvill character seem like friendship costner and crowe aren actor m fan of so obviously didn like them everyone else act be either bland or average also for original fan perry white be bland too as character and lana lang show up for two scene there be couple of moment that would be spoiler if give away why hat them but ll just summarize in this bland act awful fight scene gross look scenery miss the point within character and bore as hell m only give it 2 star because at first the scenery wasn the bad ve ever see some of the acting be good martha kent be very good and the fight scene weren so repetitive at first
not perfect but well acted and very uplifting like the title say this movie isn perfect because there a lot of stuff go on that can all be tackle in 90 minute of course that doesn necessarily mean that the film need to be long viewer may be leave ask for some more backstory on couple of thing and one of the most critical plot line of the movie isn really reference or confront very much outside of flashback understand that may have be intentional however don think it be successful with that say the positive outweigh the negative big time with this film it really be genuine love story with great chemistry between michael grant who play james and josh green who play charlie there be moment in the film that captivate you bite because of how genuinely you can tell that one care for the other despite rough time the personal struggle of the father be also well act with number of subtlety that come through really well for middle age depressed man deal with the crumbling of everything he know this movie be one of those gay come of age film that really will warm your heart because of the act definitely worth your time
oh dear the only reason watch this film be to see that beautiful josh whitehouse again very much enjoy his performance as hugh armitage in the poldark series on pbs however this film be formulaic the set decoration be over the top excessive and the two costars have zero chemistry too bad because the idea be cute concept the execution however be extremely flaw
absurd movie political polemic masquerade as drama it easy to target bank and financial institution as the bad guy whose only goal be to sell overvalued junk to an unsuspecting public that be the theme of the movie the political message of this movie be so transparently obvious that it call into question the movie maker motivation for make the movie obviously the maker of this movie do not like bank or banker the movie go so far as to assert that financial institution deliberately defraud the american public that make for convenient story because it set up the bank as the bad guy which be conventional and time test plot device for make movie yet the movie also disclaim that it be work of fiction which be the only factual part of this otherwise turgid and heavy hand attack on the financial system that drive the economy the fact be that in the world of financial invest it be impossible to predict outcome with every investment instrument come risk every mortgage be potentially financial time bomb that can lose or gain value what be consider solid investment can immediately become garbage to think that the bank know in advance that their holding be worthless and that it time to sell short mean that they be able to predict the future besides what vested interest do bank have to ruin the entire economy when people be sell home which be finance through mortgage everyone bank and home owner alike believe that these mortgage be secure they believe it because the price of home be go up then the bubble burst and the economy take heavy hit to suggest however that the bank know in advance that this would happen be stretch literary license to the bound of ridiculousness it would be like bet on sure bet at the track and then blame the track after the sure bet lose on the spurious claim that the track knew in advance that the horse would not win that the nature of gamble which be what speculation be about the good guy in this movie be four stock broker they be the good guy because they have conscience and know that what they be trade be junk yet they still trade which show that they be just as greedy as the rest the premise of this movie be absurd however the premise of the story notwithstanding the movie contain several string performance steve carell dominate this movie in performance that go against his typical kind of role he play stock broker who have to make decision that put his sense of morality to the test to learn what he do watch the movie
heartfelt true story that set on the eve of wwii so few movie today capture the emotion and artistry of storytelling good than the dig it base on true story that be beautifully make it combine amazing performance by magnificent ensemble along with majestic cinematography absolutely love this movie and enjoy every moment if ever there be netflix movie that deserve oscar consideration this one would be it for me you will not be disappoint
wow this film be simply amaze the best remake have ever see expect nothing but ace in the drama and action department in this film peter jackson manage to helm one hell of movie and what be destine to be 2005 top film never have see cg character garner so much emotion if you think the first film be heartbreaking this one down right make it tough to not shed at least tear by the end of the film by the way once the action start in this film it never let up beautiful yet sad film can wait to see it again those who be afraid that this film might do anything to take away from the original do not worry the time and setting of this film really keep the original spirit intact while carve some fantastical new ground of it own though some of the actual scenery here and there may look bit fake you will never ever think that about the main ape himself
pacino legend brilliant movie and mesmerize al pacino if think he be spectacular in gf ii and scarface then just watch him in dog day afternoon quite simply one of the great performance in movie history definitely my favorite the depth with which he play sonny be such treat to watch that lost count of how many time he leave me in awe there this indescribable nervous energy to his performance that there no way he ll leave not feel sorry for sonny sadly for some reason this movie be kinda forgotten when discuss al great movie performances that because not many people have watch it so please if consider yourself movie fan then go rent dda and watch fine movie with the legendary al pacino perform his art at the absolute peak of his career
a masterpiece this movie be an absolute pleasure to watch it be one of the most visually gorgeous movie ve ever see and the cinematography be second to none emma stone and ryan gosling both give excellent layer and hilarious performance as mia and sebastian throughout the film you really get to know the character and by the end you really care about them this film be intend as love letter to the golden day of cinema and think it do this with brilliance and effortless charm the soundtrack be phenomenal all of the musical dance number be visualy breathtaking and the choreography be awesome this movie have some heart wrench emotional scene while pull off the comedic vibe with ease there not much this film doesn do it pretty hard to fault to be honest this film be definitely worthy of it oscar win and truly be masterpiece
vastly overrate this film have amazing cgi that undeniable it be also full of bad hollywood clichéd dialogue prime example be all of the dialogue between jimmy and mr hayes plot elements the predictable romance subplot and fake overdone attempt at sentimentality combine with some frankly disturb racial imagery in its depiction of the native savage obviously counteract with the token black character the kind of stereotype presumably use as recreation of similar element in 30s movie but which die out for reason the attempt at clever style of shoot often come across as almost self parody in their laughability such as when one of the character tap out word into typewriter in slow motion while the camera cut to the shocked expression of another while the film be absurdly over long for the amount of story available do by stretch out section of action far beyond the point that they become bore many of which be in any case totally unnecessary for plot development and seem more about showcasing the great cgi in short it be gratuitous and wasteful movie bloat with its own budget and ultimately pointless
nolan best film by far this be an excellent film the cgi be great the character be great but have one problem which be the character development it didn have much of it but that be the only problem the movie do start of really confuse but in the 40 minute part get use to the story in conclusion this be great film and would highly recommend it
as entertainment brilliant go to see this have read few review also hear review from friend that richard wilkins on australian critic have say it wasn that good well have no idea what film they saw but it wasn the one saw the start be little slow but still throw in some moment of concern to keep one on the edge as the film settle on it keep move at good pace story be basic love story mix in with morality but basically love story cgi be amaze cinematography be brilliant stun even all the main character be easy on the eye too always make it easy to want to watch plot wasn sophisticated probably describe as feel good but frankly it be perfect leave 2 hour film and wasn bore for second cruise for all the press on him and his supposed kookiness don care he carry the film go see this pure entertainment
awful don waste your time such an enormous waste of time and money that could be give to scorsese or tarantino to make another movie the plot be confuse and unimaginative the acting be not bad but not great either tom cruise have never appeal to me other than his mission impossible movie and edge of tomorrow seal the deal for me something be off from the beginning from the first five minute know that something wasn right with this movie the writing be unrealistic and laughable and the camera work remind me of some homemade go pro videos this could ve be great movie if it be present 10x well and it pain me to know that the director will probably never redeem himself after blunder as big as this one the special effect and cgi weren even that great and they need to be for movie about alien
you think movie call zombie vs stripper would be at least entertain so this be what our specie have come to to be honest it not terrible but it just bore the main cast and zombie aren interest at all the location be dark and forgettable and the plot essentially go nowhere again it not the bad it just bland and forgettable and that say something for full moon picture the good part well there a guy with pig nose and few decent joke so guess if you want to watch this movie be my guest
pseudo artistic hogwash if you be one of the sheep who believe an ingmar bergman film must be masterpiece because you ve be tell they be then by all mean watch this pseudo artistic piece of baloney on the other hand if you prefer film that actually have plot definite end some point to it explanation for why the character behave as they do and where something happen skip this one in the opening prior to the title the film just jump around from meaningless image to meaningless image mostly center on scrawny young boy run his hand over the close up of some woman face accompany by music akin to fingernails on blackboard however once the title be show then the film settle down to center around two woman one be an actress elisabeth vogler who have go mute the other be alma who have be hire as her nurse why she need nurse be unclear since physically she be all right and the nurse do nothing to aid her psychologically neither do ms vogler doctor instead ms vogler accompany by alma be send to stay at the doctor beach cottage in rather isolated area how this be suppose to help her condition be never explain beyond rest since elisabeth do not speak alma more than make up for it by talk at her endlessly we be tease by undercurrent of lesbianism on the part of the two woman but this come to nothing just like the rest of the film eventually alma confesses an unbelievable graphically describe rather disgust sex scene in which she be involve and read letter elisbath leave unsealed which the actress write to the doctor the letter make alma mad and she rant quite bit at elisabeth think this be the one time elisabeth do speak get too scared not to suppose alma also rant at elisabeth about elisabeth feeling in regard to her young son how alma would know any of this be never explain in fact she do the same exact scene twice in row why the director decide to repeat this like everything else in this film unknown there be also an odd scene where elisabeth husband visit although never say assume he be blind since he be wear black glass he seem to think alma be his wife and she go along with it for some unknown reason while nimble wit elisabeth merely stand by watch even blind person would know their own spouse so this scene be absurd and completely unbelievable the film come to no particular conclusion although alma be show drive car at one point in the film it end with her get on bus as if she have no other transportation nor do we know where she be go 2 star be be generous
much good than everyone say it be have no gripe about this movie the plot be an adaptation of what the great gatsby which love anyone who say that the begin give away the end probably have attention deficiency disorder and didn pay attention to the actual story there be many instance in which you suspect the movie would end with the opening scene but it just didn and don agree with anyone say that the character be stereotype there be many type of black portray in this movie from the straight from the ghetto and real about it to the reserve cool gangster to the type that want to conform to high society the rowdiness and uncouthness of the people in summer s party be necessary in keep the feeling of the book the great gatsby where the newly rich in gatsby party be unaware of the etiquette of blue blood society and to those who say there be no hip hop believe that do hear some rap hiphop play several time throughout the movie you don expect to have an entire music video film do you overall think this movie be great there be some arguably unnecessary material sprinkle throughout the film but it should definitely get high than 4 4
old and not too smart it doesn ask any question the guy should be kill because he murder child though realize this be make with religious influence anyway old movie not very good the acting be cheesy laughable it not bad movie just not worth anything completely see how it influential though it well make

highly entertain ignore the review have hear lot of bad review about this film expect it to be yet another disappointing attempt to transfer good tv show to film what more be never much of fan of the original tv show be however big fan of matthew broderick and rupert everett and they don disappoint in the slight both ham it up beautifully and make the most of this film the script be far from innovative but it do have some very clever joke there be few moment of smarmy use your heart dialogue but they re thankfully keep to minimum and outnumber by some more subversive line
the history of most beautiful most vertuous most learned and every way accomplish lady agora be recent film set in classical time which be neither large scale sword and sandal epic like gladiator or troy nor an action movie like the eagle or centurion rather it be biopic of hypatia of alexandria female philosopher mathematician and astronomer who live in egypt in the late 4th and early 5th century ad she be real person although the fact of her life be dispute particular controversy surround the exact circumstance of and motivation for her murder at the hand of mob in 415 ad the film be set against the background of the struggle for pre eminence between the old religion of greco roman polytheism and the rise new faith of christianity alexandria also have large jewish community who play part in the story in the heyday of the roman epic the 1950s film on this theme the robe quo vadis ben hur almost always have pro christian slant but this be quite absent from agora in which the christian of alexandria be generally portray as be ignorant fanatical and cruel bigot determine to stamp out any rival system of thought not that the religiously observant polytheist be really any good near the beginning of the film one elderly pagan be hear to regret the fact that it be no longer permit to fee christian to the lion as would have be do in his grandfather time and the pagan be as keen to instigate pogrom against the christian as vice versa in reality hypatia be philosopher of the neo platonist school group who have many thing in common with christianity they believe for example in single god and in the immortality of the soul and their teaching be strong influence on early christian theology the film however be not particularly interested in hypatia religious or philosophical belief she be portray by rachel weisz as rationalistic sceptic unconvinced by either christianity or polytheism it be much more interested in her supposed mathematical and astronomical think none of her writing on these subject have survive but in the film she be portray as not an advocate of heliocentric model of the solar system to which the christian object on religious ground moreover she be also show as anticipating by more than thousand year kepler discovery that the planet move around the sun in elliptical rather than circular orbit in the early eighteenth century the deist philosopher john toland write tract with the rather long winded title hypatia or the history of most beautiful most vertuous most learned and every way accomplish lady who be tear to piece by the clergy of alexandria to gratify the pride emulation and cruelty of their archbishop commonly but undeservedly stil st cyril be not sure if the film maker alejandro amenábar use toland work as one of his source but that title could also serve as summary of the film ideological position hypatia be the heroine beautiful intelligent rational and an ardent defender of science and reason the main villain be cyril the fanatical rabble rouse patriarch of alexandria man who hat hypatia partly because of her refusal to embrace christianity partly because of her advocacy of theory regard by the church as heretical and partly because she make convenient target in his continue feud with orestes the roman governor of alexandria cyril suspect orestes with some justification of have make an insincere conversion to christianity for purely political reason the film attempt to be film of idea tackle big subject the relationship between religion and science unfortunately it do so in historically inappropriate way the idea of fundamental conflict between religion and science be nineteenth century one largely supersede by modern history of science those who propound the idea of such conflict tend to concentrate on few select episode such as the persecution of galileo by the inquisition and the controversy over darwinism and there be no evidence of such conflict in fifth century egypt and no historical support for the idea of hypatia as proto galileo eleven century avant la lettre which be how amenábar invite us to see her as say the exact reason for her murder be dispute but it appear to have have more to do with anti pagan bigotry and with local alexandrian politics than with any opposition to her scientific work the film other main flaw be that with multitude of major character there be many others besides the few refer to above and constant stream of plot development which make the storyline difficult to follow one scene that find particularly strange be the one where hypatia reject the advance of male admirer by present him with her menstrual rag in order to demonstrate the baseness of sexual desire now it be quite true that such story be tell about hypatia in one early although not contemporary source but amenábar ignore the fact that to modern audience such gesture would be likely to indicate not philosophical detachment from carnal lust but serious mental health issue there be some good feature about the film weisz performance be not bad one and the attempt to recreate ancient alexandrian life be quite impressive but overall be leave with the impression that much good film could have be make on this subject

long humorless film this film be suppose to be comedy and admit that the very last scene be funny but the rest of the film have no humor the tremendous dependence on single expletive and its many form become dull and boring after the first five minute during which it be use about 100 time the two scene in which topless woman appear be obviously insert just so she could be show but there be no point other than that one the scene in which corvette be destroy be completely predictable and it unfold in strange way and then fade away julianna moore be the best part of the film and joe pesci talent be waste on trivial part for which he clearly have no enthusiasm jeff bridge practice in his role for his academy award as the character be identical once again hollywood insists that all drug usage be good lack of moral character be good drinking be good and be bum be good if you have heart of gold the film be long too
luckily not sappy drama when find happiness aka haeng bok or hængbok in the asian movie section be instantly draw to the movie because of the dvd cover so read the synopsis for the movie and it seem interest so of course decide to sit down to watch happiness must admit that have expect somewhat of more sappy type of story give the premise of the storyline but luckily director jin ho hur didn fall into the obvious choice and come up with sappy story no instead the director go for more personal and character driven storyline which didn cash in on cheap tear jerking and playing on the illness of the two character this be essentially more of personal growth and love story than it be sappy drama draw cheap tear and emotional ups and down from play on the audience sympathy for the two main character the cast in the movie be quite good and do believe that this be the first time that have get acquaint with jung min hwang play young su and soo jung lim play eun hee they have great on screen chemistry and they both perform very very well both individually but also together on the screen as for the character in the movie then they be as well write and construct as the storyline and script be and it be character that you instantly take like to and it be character that you can connect with and relate to though can personally understand why young su would revert back to drinking and his former lifestyle after be so well on the path to recovery but then again never have an alcohol problem so can fully grasp the severity of that addiction one of the most emotional scene for me be see eun hee when she be run after she have her heart break by young su statement and it be especially emotional because she have state earlier in the movie that run might cause her to die the dialogue in the movie be quite well write and it be clever dialogue that suit the story quite well and it be dialogue that seem genuine and proper for the respective character deliver them there be definitely lot of thought behind the script and dialogue because it have quite an impact happiness be drama that hit hard but luckily do so without be tacky and sappy however it be not tearjerker as many others of the same premise would have be and for that then find happiness to be quite good

a definite masterpiece what transfix me throughout every scene of this sinewy offbeat film be the extraordinarily pragmatic realism of the hurtles sonny and sal confront inside the bank not even twenty minute into the film we find we re already see thing absolutely no other crime film have ever include that be astonish in their dramatic persuasiveness the head teller and the bank manager pick apart sonny plan with him one clerk husband call and ask what time the robber will be through so he know if he have to cook for himself or not while order the bank manager to help him block the back entrance by move big desk sonny asks offhand why he hire diabetic as guard and be tell in ordinary person to person term what guard salary be and why poor old howard have that job and when do mulvaney the bank manager play by captivate unknown character actor sully boyar tell hostage taker he like to see his family again but if someone must be take take him when he help his captor move big desk to block the back they sound like regular work urbanites so catch up in the daily grind of city life that they might as well be make small talk in an elevator later the phone ring sonny pick up it a sicko tell him to kill em all sonny hang up after four second move on the female teller sit and sweat while giggle about the same silly thing he say the word well m christian and my ear be not garbage can in the thick of hostage situation and medium circus poignant real every nuance of pacino performance be incredibly realistic he practically possess the audience as we can begin to expect certain thing from him and care about him because he play by an actor who completely subsist as him at point when character speak of him off screen speaking of thing that we be surprise to hear about him that take us aback and color his image pacino have prepare the size for those turn point to fit in his improvised scene be exceptional as well and be in fact some of the most riveting nail bitingly intense scene in the entire film in such scene he be match by the great actor charles durning and chris sarandon become fulfillment of his role indeed this be by far durning most riveting performance he work so well here because in shout match with sonny he look and sound entirely his age not movie character he fat middle age tired just as surprised as everybody else he run short of breath try desperately to keep up with the pressure cook high all around him as det sgt eugene moretti durning epitomize the thankless job of police officer more candidly and perfectly than any other movie cop ve ever see one of this stunning succession of brilliant scene be the first time sonny emerges to talk face to face with moretti in the street which begin with protracted pin drop silence and slowly steadily invisibly culminate in deafen ear split chaos lumet open the film with montage of city scene in nyc with good get up in the morning song like elton john amoreena and with the same indifference end up on sonny sal and their friend wait outside bank in car an image that just happen to continue this be great way to demonstrate the it could happen anywhereness lumet overall direction of the film be beautiful indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s the climactic final ten minute be ruthless in their steadily unravel almost unbearably intense tragedy it not only one of the most effective us of sound to create drama ve ever see but everything conclude exactly as it would in reality
avenger be an amazing movie with an amazing cast the avenger bring together group of extremely talented actor and epic superheroes to create an action pack movie with hilarious banter lace into countless scene superhero movie give actor chance to play new character with personality they have never portray before chris evans be the extremely passionate and kind hearted captain america while robert downey jr be the tougher and sassy iron man the film be very creative with introduce each character and later bring them together the villain loki laufeyson play by tom hiddleston even show his weak spot and be almost see as part of the avenger team the actor have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen and they make man tights and cape look more fashionable than ever the majority of the film be do by special effect make by an amazing team they transform new york city into place for hero place tony stark tower house in the middle of the city even at the end of the film the unsuspecting tony stark be willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else this be wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertain while have your feel play with at the same time
extremely lame and long with no substance well where do start several point make this one of the most dreadful experience have have in cinema so far in first place the gore wish snyder ever realize that he just doesn have to splatter the screen with blood every 35 second not to mention body part open fracture explode body it be soooooooo useless and soooooooo become in bad movie with no story whatsoever in second place the story it could have be interest but it be present in such disorganized way that it make you wonder what be on the mind of the writer and or director three plot line that have they be develop great movie could have come out in this case they be just present but not even barely developed third the acting with the possible exception of rorshach maybe they be good performer but the script be so idiotic that probably this be the best they could do fourth the soundtrack very good song completely inappropriate for the scene they go with what sick mind would put sound of silence in cemetery scene or the movement of mozart requiem with the wrong tempo in the next to final scene this be really incomprehensible to me all in all give this movie two point one for the special effect the second one for the performance of the actor that play rorschach see it if you have to or to form your own opinion
offensively bad don think you can make movie like this unless you really truly dislike the content and harbor great deal of enmity towards anyone who might like it the effort necessary to get everything wrong to miss every beat to offend every memory that someone might have that would inspire them to go risk another attempt at this franchise that have to come from place of real disgust think what be amaze be how regularly that kind of pointed loathe seem to be give the reign of property that an audience really care about aside from the deep spiritual mistreatment which be difficult give how weird and wobbly the fantastic four be to begin with the pacing be poisonous with the bulk of the film dedicate to what feel like an attempt at an involved origin story but where the character aren really give anything to do or to care about in an attempt to avoid be explicit with motivation think the character instead limp around under the shadow of intention maybe johnny be upset with his dad maybe ben be look for purpose it possible richards spend his time in exile try to help his friend it hard to say good filmmaking could have answer these question subtly it didn happen here this be joyless uninteresting movie with cast that look like they be wait for something else to start and don understand how they could spend all that money on movie that look this bad design to set special effect it all incredibly date and generic one of the bad movie ve ever watch
not one of jim best have become big jim carrey fan over the year think me myself and irene be the funny of all the movie not the tv version but this just leave me feel disappointed very few funny scene it be also very predictable could barely come up to 4 in the rating system it look like good chance for jim to return to the level that he start but the movie just fall flat guess you have to figure that there be no way you can say yes to everything and have thing work out it just seem like an excellent opportunity for jim to create something do like his love interest play by zooey deschanel could not place where have see her before she have one of those familiar face not too pretty not to plain just the kind of cute that seem to go for the close thing could compare this movie to would be liar liar only not as funny but the same general idea maybe like his humor to be more crude but thats just me
what be the point of the last 7 episode spoiler be not an expert on the uk criminal justice system but it seem to me that they know who the killer be where he live and they see him multiple time what more preponderance of evidence do they need every detail point to him include fingerprint on the murder weapon why do they not arrest him this show be like law and order svu episode but not as good and 10 hour long why be there more episode of this show it do not make sense zero dramatic tension start off promising and end as one of the most inane piece of crap that have ever watch there be no reason at all for the last 5 episode at least should never have start waste my time on this show feel use have no clue why the review be largely positive maybe they re for the first season do not be dupe
over rat the movie have potential to be good but it be total disappointment the acting be moderate but they ware low on budget that they couldn afford boat for one of the scene so they make cgi the plot be super weak and the story look like ripoff of break bad they didn bother explain most of the stuff be happen in conclusion it be bad that wonder woman

poor remake whilst the landscape and population be interest the film lack any real story as such max tom hardy have the charisma and depth of mouldy pair of underpants charlize theron have one arm for some reason which be never really justified although it do add something to her character which would have be put to well use with max the main villain immortan joe be on of the good character albeit rehashed version of bane with don king hair he seemingly have two son one who be very small and disabled and the other who be giant beast of man yet again this be something the film make no attempt to explain which be shame as it would add to the very thin plot the vehicle design be outstanding and credit must be give to the engineer who put them together assume they aren all cgi to summarise the film they spend 50 of the runtime escape the main villain and his henchman only to turn back in the opposite direction to finish where they start

simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity green book be wonderful story of overcome self condemnation and the result freedom it provide as the film begin tony be lock in prison of judgment and rejection not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstance and environment as the self assure and self aware character of dr shirley be introduce into tony life tony embarks on journey of self discovery in which he be force to confront his own preconceived notion which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself as dr shirley help tony to see himself as man beyond his own limiting thought tony be finally able to step into his true nature as friend to dr shirley everywhere in this film we be remind that people be complicate but beyond these complication we be also remind that everyone be the same just look for love and acceptance the scene where dolores read tony letter to her cousin be spectacular in this regard it interest that none of the other review mention the ymca scene and aftermath which for me be the pinnacle moment that the power shift for these two character confront their own strength and weaknesses this film be simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity and the people we need in our life while it come to light that tony wife dolores be completely aware of her husband imperfection and shortcoming she love him just the same but it be confrontation not love that be necessary to bring about tony redemption demonstrate that the people who spur us to deep personal growth be never who or what we expect

brilliant movie rather enjoy the movie for what it be don get what the fuss be about nor the 7 3 grade kong be depict much less as monster while monster movie genre have to be as fill with grotesque fantasy creature as possible at least some of those creature don necessarily have to be monstrous on the inside as well and with more sentiment invoke within him when he meet gentle female human sure human denham and his crew be present as cruel and immoral but it be also thanks to human ann darrow that kong go through transformation from mere monster to gentle care guardian of nature and martyr of the crew predator like villainy as well as of bourgeois anthropocentric sensation hungry new york society didn give it 10 star firstly due to its exaggerated length as believe relatively concise story as in the case of kong can be tell in less time the skull island definitely have its irreplaceable moment of interest but felt as if plenty of them be merely space filler in attempt to bring on as many exotic depiction of its mysterious fauna as possible they occasionally didn pay much attention to logic g herd of what twenty or so brontosaurus run from several venatosauruses three giant vastatosauruses engage in desperate fight with kong to devour ann who be hardly enough of food to even one rex jimmy shoot the wetas away from driscoll but doesn hit him with single bullet and d name few more event which can recall right now the movie sometimes boast with exoticism and knowledge on paleozoology when really it would have fare good if it expose less of mere imagery of the skull island and more of story and logic
with over 900 review mine be hardly necessary blu ray excellent 10 10 first off know that m gon na get grief and derision from most here because m sorry but don really think this film be the be all end all that everyone think it be yes it be well make direct and act and the lighting be sharp which fit the nihilistic noir ish mood and yes it be indeed pretty much the first of it kind which set gritty dark tone for crime film to come fine really have no specific negative about the movie however at the end of the day do personally really find it that entertain not really yes the unexpected end be both shock and dramatic but do it honestly make sense spoiler keven spacey clearly and explicitly state the reason why he have commit these murder that people be do all these very bad thing everywhere all the time and people just don care so he be set the example of what people should be do to punish these sinner okay now we be suppose to believe then that out of the blue he kill completely innocent woman who be also pregnant which to me the sole purpose be for an admittedly extremely dramatic and shock plot device to set up mill to kill him come on don buy it it be totally contrary to the very motivation of kevin spacey character but yeah what an end sure end spoilersanyway the question be what do we find truly entertain about film put stylistic touch or technical competence aside such as visual effect special or moody lighting excellent cinematography sound design etc to me it primarily be this how engaging or absorbing be the plot or story how do it carry us along as it develop how involve and complex be the character and how interesting be the interplay and relationship between them now these be just basic for most film realize that there be special genre or style that we enjoy individually simply because we like those type of film 1950 sci fi slasher horror film ultra cheeeeezy kung fu movie etc but with this film at the end of the day what do we have sure we have this ghoulish creepy dark story of killer who be kill by way of the 7 deadly sin okay character well yes all the actor concern do fine job no real complaint there but how deep or complex be they how fascinate be they really how engaging and intrigue be their interaction to me personally felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial mean what do we really know about them how deeply be we draw into their life and relationship m sorry but to me really don see whole hell of lot go on here other than bunch of neatly light dark and somewhat moody scene with little or no real substance and the overall message we be leave with the quite trite common and ultimately boring no one care because the evil that people do be so arbitrary and horrible so what the point yeah real depth there so yeah the film be well put together and there nothing really bad about it per se but do not feel myself that after all be say and do that you walk away from it with much of anything there be darker and far more entertaining horror film out there and there be also dark gritty and infinitely more complex and engage crime film out there film where afterward you actually feel like you have either be truly entertain by story that make you think and guess and wonder and also with character who make you feel and care much more about them because they be portray in good fuller and more complex way so do like dark ambiguous moody film you bet do like the dark even nihilistic overtone of period film noir absolutely do even like film with little substance but have ton of style and mood la david lynch say yes siree but to me this film although of good quality honestly strike me as one note simplistic film and just do not quite buy into the end at all it be merely completely nonsensical plot device to give us slam bang end mean just random example that come to mind ve see sandra bullock crime film murder by number like 3 time and ve fully enjoy it each time you have main character that be extremely complex and engage you have antagonist that be thoroughly rivet and with layered relationship that be completely fascinating and you have story that as it unreel truly draws you into the psyche feeling and motivation of the character and this be just an off the top fairly above average example nothing earth shake or anything but just simple example of what movie be suppose to be entertain but will say this though it have to have probably the best opening credit sequence and background song ever for this film though seriously doubt that would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again edit 2015 02 14 heh m actually think about give this another chance and watch it again m curious if my impression will still be the same
actually good movie for woman and men think this be go to be another stoner movie but it be actually good movie with really well write script it be funny heartwarming and thoughtful the joke be intelligent the acting be genuine and not force like how the female character be realistically empower and didn take b from the men but not in cliche way this be really enjoyable for both me and my boyfriend
car stunt action spectacular and blast when you watch movie you must know the type of the movie like the fast and furious franshine that its all about car and stunt and action be huge fan of the franshine since fast five and its keep growing big and big for example they destroy 200 car for bank vault in fast five then in furious 6 they get tank then what they want to do something big they drop real car with parachute this be why love this franshine because the amazing stunt furious 7 like the previous two the story be stupid and over the top but the stunt be amaze and they destroy 230 car for the movie like maserate 2014 and aston martin db9 2008 and nissan gtr 2012 and lykan hypersport 2014 and many many car and the beginning of the movie be solid when jason statham deckard shaw be talk to his brother owen shaw after he kill the black ops guy and destroy the hospital and the soundtrack payback be amazing and the first chase sequence between dom and deckard it be amaze and end with huge collision then mr nobody come and save dom and he want him for mission to bring ramsay the hacker because she create device that find anybody in the world and to find shaw at this point the story become rescue mission than revenge plot and the mountain scene be the best in the movie because great stunt and camera work and they destroy 50 car for that scene and in abu dahbi we saw the lykan hypersport jump between two tower and it be fantastic and we saw another chase sequence between dom and deckard this time dom with his iconic muscle car the beast dodge charger 1970 and shaw with the british car aston martin db9 2008 and end with collision but this time the charger win at the end deckard shaw go to secure prison and of curse he will back in furious 8 and despite his short time in the movie jason statham be badass villain and hope he get more time in furious 8 and of curse we don forget tony jaa he be amaze in his tow fight scence with paul walker but unfortunately he die and ronda rousy also her fight scence with letty be greet and the final tribute for paul walker be amazing and emotional and the wiz khalifa song see you again make you cry and forget the movie and we saw final ride between dom charger and paul walker real car toyota supra so for me furious 7 be the best one in series know it over the top but the car and stunt and action be the best in while

theatrical wasteland of idea well no really don get all the excitement regard this movie it begin rather pretentious with the inner turmoil of max but that the deep part what follow be few great idea waste in bad script like great action like steam punk metal rig vehicle base stuff the mad max premise the society after the destroyed world the weirdo thing like the guitar rig but not in this concoction make choice then go for that the action be great but the rest fall flat like the character max isn the lead character and feel like stupid ox the development of his character isn there to support his action later on furiosa be the main character and have some spirit the evil guy be just that and the boy be to recognizable as that guy that play it what his name the action in this movie be great the chase intense but that all stop when they get to the mother oh my from then on the scriptwriter must have think well let put some emotion in here and that be the failure think they want action story and emotional development attachment the last fail miserably the story be hide somewhere beneath rubble and the action doesn hold because of the first fail sadly so great idea nice picture but bad execution
i be fool by the rating the movie be shout so loud to catch attention and it certainly do too bad it be so disappointing and shallow afterwards 3d do not entertain or maybe drag the whole movie down even more than the sad plot from the begin it be clear to me that the movie win jump high enough and come up to my expectation all have to do be watch the trailer and it tell me how the whole movie will be explosion dorky costume pointless dialog and lame joke that recently have flood hollywood surely when the avenger come out and saw the rating 8 8 assume that be wrong such great score just have to see this magnificent most brilliant movie ever time in the theater pass and my little sparkle die rather quickly not only do some part could have be cut out to shorten the torture but they could have add little bit of originality too no matter how look at it some scene and idea resemble transformer 3 this be not brilliant at all perhaps when overjoy comic lover settle down the avenger will reach its true rating and be remember as another common hollywood trash as for now can only weep for my money
so you be tell me romance movie can also be smart after the first 15 minute think be watch less versión of before sunset with sci fi touch couldn have be more wrong this be masterpiece on every facet of cinema the story be complex with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue the acting from the protagonist be amaze hard to believe this be the same actress that make titanic and even jim carrey disappears on the role except for two or three moment mark ruffalo and kristen dunst weren that great in small role and the rest of the cast be serviceable good the score couldn possibly be good well maybe it could ve be but it be still great this be an extremely romantic movie with sci fi touch that make easy to get into the philosophical and existential theme they approach all without lose anything in the entertainment department
overrate typical hollywood sensationalism movie make with gun and fight to sell ticket mindless shallow entertainment it should have be television movie how it get the acclaim it do be beyond me the acting be self indulgent john wayne american fantasy it must have be heavily finance in the promotion department there be such lack of quality write they have to rely on sensationalism to illustrate the very serious issue of the pharmaceutical industry not well depicted nevertheless feel like waste of time
the unfinished story of tbofa this review contain few spoiler the battle of five army the last part of poor trilogy it make me exited and give me hope because maybe it could be like the return of the king but no this movie be an embarrassment for peter jackson the man who just get himself star on the street of hollywood this man turn out to be just like all the other hollywood director money wolf this trilogy be make for nothing more than money why 3 part why and half of the book isn even conclude in the movie 260 page book spread in 9 hour in movie could be something awesome but it didn it become horrible something that annoy me add character no character development no emotional moment to many you get to be kid me moments no dwarf elve or men die in the battle where be there brutality of the lotr where in the most epic battle of movie history everything take place grief death epicness sadness moment of smile while have hard time try not to let go of some tear and above all the fact that you don know how many of the good people will survive well in tbofa nobody die expect orcs cgi monster and than some other thing that make no sense and be leave out what happen with the arkenstone who become king under the mountain where do tauriel go what happen to the dwarve what happen to the lake people and what about the gem of the elf isn that what this movie be all about how hard be it to include 15 minute more and tell this and why do peter jackson change the story about the death of fili and kili where be the love of brother ship that what like about the book it be about love for your brother not about the love of stupid make up elve girl oh and above all middle earth look life an awful ugly world while it suppose to be an amazing wonderful world peter jackson mess up big timei think this be enough for you guy to get why this movie be horrible compare to what it could ve become story rank worthy to the lotr movie 2 10 1 star because it be middle earth and 1 star because bilbo play an amazing role oh yeah speaking of bilbo he look like side character isn he the main character
make revenge of the fallen look like best picture winner just don get it stephen sommers bounce back from the colossal disaster van helsing only to give us something worse the fact that this piece of t take 170 million to make be more talked about than the movie itself and for good reason when you spend that much money on film it usually at least look like money well spent despite sommers look what the same studio paramount do with 30 million cloverfield guess what write doesn cost that much money and clearly there be no real effort in that department why when you can spend some of that money on insane practical stunt and create memorable sequence like some other director do would you spend it on create base under polar ice cap and the sand of egypt which look like cartoon sequence edit into live action the cgi be bad very bad the action be as expect non stop stereotype and irritate the stunt be non existent as everything be cg the woman kick more arse than everyone else the paris sequence be pretty much everything you see in the trailer and clip disappoint when you see the whole thing instead of quick cut it be always obvious that this film would hide lack of substance with style but quite frankly it be not very stylish snake eye be sadly immensely under use channing tatum be the bad actor ve see since hayden christensen pathetic musical score pathetic dialogue and attempt at humor even from the usually funny marlon wayans completely non memorable performance from everyone else dennis quaid might as well have not be in the movie for everyone who watch the trailer and exclusive clip that pretty much all there be in the movie it be at best pathetic even by stephen sommers summer blockbuster standard hard to think stuart beattie could write screenplay this bad you ll see what m talk about if you re unfortunate enough to watch the character so call back story and the now requisite lead onto sequel end cheesy cheap look which still can not comprehend not cool bad than sister concern revenge of the fallen and have horrible feeling stephen sommers may have destroy potentially mind blow franchise even before it kick off since every other franchise seem to be do it these day who know maybe reboot with another director unheard of for second film know but this be how bad it be and do not want to see it die before it bear save grace if there be such thing for this film ray park as snake eye his costume more than anything since they waste his presence and potential brendan fraser second long cameo which personally enjoy more than the whole movie the concept in the movie which sadly be take to sommers ish level in term of execution sienna miller rachel nichols not their pathetic ten second fight sequence
a disappointment kung fu panda 3 be good but it could have be great that a shame the core of the movie be solid with enough of both heart warming and heart stopping moment but the majority of the movie be really unfunny filler as per usual the majority of the cast have maybe two line in the entire movie far too much time be devote to slapstick shenanigan and most of the plot be info dupe at the end the story be an almost beat for beat recreation of kung fu panda 2 new villain have show up in this case kai the spirit warrior who can steal people chi and po must learn new spell in order to defeat him the five be completely useless shifu be completely useless po be completely useless right up until the end when victory be hand to him by deus ex machina there enough plot there for 20 minute tv episode but it stretch into barely 90 minute movie by judicious pad if you don mind movie waste your time and its own potential with what feel like an eternity playing with the panda you ll find enough to be engage there be theme of self identification familial bond friendship and even come of age again the voice actor be talented and able to give gravitas to frankly amateurish write the visuals be beautiful enough to bring tear to the eye and there a surprising amount of action to be find it just shame that all of that couldn be put in an entire movie the original kung fu panda be great because it play to the beat of an old bootleg hong kong kung fu movie of the sort jackie chan might have star in back in the 80s its final lesson at the end of the day be simplistic but heartfelt believe in yourself as po the dragon warrior have only to look at himself and his own strength to defeat adversity kung fu panda 2 and now kung fu panda 3 make the mistake of hinge everything on magical power which be inevitably give to po so he can win and so that character development can be drop onto him in the meantime tigress and the others only serve to get beat up so the villain look more menacing bizarrely enough kung fu panda 3 could use less panda and more kung fu
an uncommonly strong sequel the conjure 2 doesn waste time in bring the scare in by that mean you re pretty much in the thick of it from the get go be give some background via another very notorious haunt incident for what be to follow the warren be send on behalf of the church to investigate some paranormal activity which be whip up medium storm in enfield england and as per the first movie they go and attempt to work their magic on the situation once again family be be haunt and they fear for their sanity and life there be few new twist this time round so all do not play out as before but it not complete departure from the format which might have make it bit more gripping in place james wan trademark visual style be repeat in this movie his bag of trick sometimes yield sense of deja vu but generally work like charm when it intend to scare it really do the scare come bit more frequently than in the first movie and do manage to build lot of tension even if you ve see the original so well do to wan for that what really enjoyable about this movie be its nostalgic recreation of 70s england wan have really do great job of this which be surprising give that he not from there also the central support role of janet hodgson be pretty crucial to empathise with the enfield family and madison wolfe give solid performance it arguable this one be as strong as the first really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoy part one or indeed likes movie of haunting or possession theme some awesome unsettling and creepy music in place too
a classic but not perfect fritz lang m be undoubtedly one of cinema most influential work it set precedent for all thriller that would follow it demonstrate the property of mi en scene with expertise and style but it be not perfect film certainly be bias due today high standard for story tell through film but be cinema at its basic and as such it feel very simplify the story be very straight forward there be child killer on the loose and both the cop and the crook be out to get him but feel the film suffers because of this there be no expansion on the theme of the story and the message be practically tell to you in the film last line rather than gradually develop throughout the entire film it be this kind of simplification that leave the viewer feeling unsatisfied while it would be unfair to go so far as to call it shallow offer no depth in term of story or character the character in general be barely even develop with the exception of peter lorre beckett we be not give time to understand who the character be each scene we meet new major dialog character and most of the time we never see them again while lang and writer thea von harbou do an admirable job indicate who we be suppose to view as the good guy they do not give the audience time to connect with the more important character like the miss child mother or the police captain this leave the viewer feeling more detached and less likely to respond to the film the performance be also over the top practice that be leave over from the silent era the story itself be rather poorly pace or rather it could have be edit well with the story rarely intercutting between the police investigation into the child killer and the criminal hunt for the murderer the film should have more individual scene thus create more rapid and intense sense of suspense the transition themselves between the scene could have be improve as well lang make frequent use of the fade technique technique that be often overuse in many classic film thus create sense of dreaminess whether this be his intention or not feel that it be distract and further detaches the viewer from the emotional content of the film perhaps the most noticeable element that be miss from the picture be music this have more to do with the emergence of talkie than it do with anything else it be felt by most film maker at the time that the music that have provide most of the emotion of the old silents would be too distracting and create clutter in film in which there be practical soundtrack but it be in the use of in the hall of the mountain king that prove to be one of the most innovative aspect of the film not only do it serve as plot point with it be use to point out the killer but it set trend of associate musical cue to identify to the viewer who the protagonist and who the antagonist be and when they be influence the story the other notable aspect of the film be peter lorre performance through his portrayal of han beckert we learn to sympathize with the killer we be draw in by his plea for mercy and we can feel his fear as the crook search for him in the bank build the lighting of his character be also particularly effective as it always keep him in the shadow create mood of forebode whenever we see him or his shadow for that matter again be view this from the perspective of time in which taste and standard be vastly different than in the time that be make but can still see why this film be hold in such high regard without it modern thriller would not be where they be today influence that it have on modern cinema be irreplaceable and the theme of the film unfortunately still ring true
almost unwatchable at time almost unwatchable at time this scandinavian tour de force go way beyond where you want to go and for what it be inconceivable that this complicate deranged filthy noisy and objectionable film could have be put together so convincingly without there be real and genuine anger to express we have father make porno in the lounge whilst his son take no part and barely leave his room the girl be use and abuse and come back for more it transpire that the son mother die in car crash when he be four and we later learn that the crazed and desperate father be rap by his father as boy there be dig at reality tv cosmetic surgery and violence against woman but surely most of this brutal journey be mr moodysson try to tell us something about himself and that be really scary bataille would have love it
sit back and enjoy the show be always amaze at how many reviewer seem to pick apart and over analyze movie look for all kind of hidden meaning and some deep backstory think most people just watch film for the shear entertainment value this movie be just fun to watch with some adventure relationship story line some part of just craziness suspense and laugh gee what concept and since it be not full of cuss sex and kill should attract large audience to enjoy it some critic have write it too far fetched and not believable sure but no more than all the totally unbelievable adventure movie that have such fantastic action stunt that no human could possible live through hey their movie sit back relax and enjoy d recommend this movie to anyone
go to sleep instead wow bank rob movie with little interest what do you think will happen not much it a lame film with little development and no funny or catchy line no real action and it just drag if this be quality film making in the 1970 then they have some pretty low standard around that time the robbery and everything that happen in the bank and around the bank be total letdown so boring why do bother to waste my time watch it oh cause be too lazy to turn the tv off
terrible what be they think this be the bad version of the classic jane austen novel ever love jane austen and so do my mother we be excite to see how well they portray the story of the five bennet sister what disappointment really we couldn stop laughing at the horrible acting and the goofy character the costume be terrible the people choose be terrible not only that but we be bore out of our mind during the whole film it be the big waste of 10 buck not to mention the two hour of my life that will never ever get back jane austen would consider this slap in the face also didn think that kiera knightly act couldn get any bad from pirate but guess what be wrong ll admit it be very wrong she hit the bottom of the barrel with this movie the truly great version of this novel be the 1995 bbc mini series star colin firth the character be superbly play and the scenery be just beautiful this version be so perfect give it 20 shame on everyone who enjoy the 2005 version shame on you all
great musical number pretty pathetic story there be some terrific song in holiday inn and some wonderful dance number so good in fact that it easy to just ignore how terrible the story be the truth be astaire and crosby play remarkably unsavory character while supposedly friends astaire think nothing of steal crosby fiancé at the beginning of the play and later try to take his subsequent girlfriend meanwhile crosby show his love through series of trick and manipulation design to make sure his girl will never experience any success outside of what he bestow on her while you can argue as some do that the black face sequence didn seem nearly as creepy then as now even crosby girl object to his behavior during the film and don think there be really any time when it be consider okay to steal someone fiancé to make it weird there be little indication that either of them be more than mildly attach to either girl crosby response to be jilt be simple oh well and he seem to forgive astaire quite promptly astaire seem to go after crosby woman less because he like them than because they re there really these be terrible terrible people and if there terribleness wasn comment on at the time it be not because it be consider acceptable behavior but because the lead personal charm and talent and irving berlin classic song seem far more important than typically inconsequential musical plot
awesome love it it be innovative funny and personal the humor and the story be heart felt and love his use of picture in the background to illustrate his story one of the best comedy show ve see in while love humor that come from real life stories its more relatable and hysterical enjoy every minute of it
horrendous many of the negative comment so far have already say what want to say that be sure the animation and the background be wonderful but that almost make the film even bad it feel like lose chance at make very good film with both great animation and good script find this film severely lack in that last department can not understand why it be rank so high on the top 250 at the time of write this around spot 40 none of the character action seem motivate and they be very badly develop it seem like the person responsible for the story here just throw lot of cute and weird character in and make the whole thing an obvious reference to alice in wonderland and think the rest would solve itself it didn the end result be that you just don care the pace be very slow lot of thing may happen but the film doesn draw you in think that many of the problem with the film princess mononoke be repeat in this anime think this be so bad it be provocative want to leave before have see half of it but sit in the middle of the row so endure the rest and the movie never get any good my rating 1 10
totally baffle if you have any clue what be go on in this movie you be the new einstein its like the writer have take the loose page of 2001 space odyssey star war and perhaps whalley throw them up in the air together pick them up randomly and use them as the screen play the plot be very poorly explain make the film very hard to follow the story be more of shoot em up computer game than sci fi movie if your concentration waver for second you haven a clue who be who or where they be or when it be happen effect be good with lot of speed scene and explosion act be ok but the plot be that bad you don really care couldn wait to leave the theater
so glad have low expectation be drag to see catwomen by mate of mine have hear how bad it be so have absolutely no expectation of it be on the same planet as anything good so from this point of view be neither surprised or disappointed oscar winner halle berry delivers performance that would make the grade in daytime soap but not much else in my opinion she didn even work as piece of eye candy that suit be just ugly as for the rest benjamin bratt be wooden and sharon stone just plain horrible finally the director pitof riight do nothing to even remotely excite ve have more thrilling maths class really have luckily he can use different name for his next film pitof be nickname be just so thankful have low expectation for catwomen or would be way more angry at it and the people that make it then be now
my note eh decent concept with decent story but fill with old movie quality so many dumb moment barely funny about 1 viewing
visually stun with wonderful score but deeply flaw before you flame me try to like this film really try while it do have its strength and far from the bad film ever make it be deeply flaw and no it be not just the historical inaccuracy ll start off with the good thing first braveheart be very well make the scenery and landscape be beautifully realise and the cinematography be beautiful the music be absolutely wonderful and give plenty of dramatic and emotional weight easily one of james horner best score the battle scene be very well stag while james cosmo brian cox and sophie marceau among the cast do good work however to say this film be inaccurate historically be understatement in itself grant be no historian but take an interest in the subject and even could tell that any history text book be literally throw out of the window like say with the patriot the inaccuracy be the least of braveheart problem how about the hackneyed dialogue the uneven pacing and the stodgy story and don get me start on its presentation of some of the character especially king edward and sorry but homosexual be stereotype as wimpy and effeminate didn bode well with me either while some of the actor do good job some didn do so well mel gibson who personally don care for though he have do some film like do good job direct than act here he come across as very monotone and his hair doesn fit the period don think plus he remind me too much of mad max patrick mcgoohan didn work for me as longshanks king edward either mcgoohan certainly be not bad actor love him in the columbo episodes he guest star in where he play one of the more interesting murderer but he overact quite wildly here it doesn help that longshanks have be turn into sneer cliché all in all not completely terrible but deeply flaw film and be sorry but didn care for it that say can understand both viewpoint there be those who love it and braveheart certainly have some great asset to it but there be also those who dislike it for its presentation of the character and its distortion of history both of which be understandable 4 10 bethany cox
not the best but watchable some part be good watch this film know what you get yourself into watch and this thought alone will make you enjoy it kevin bacon be always fun to see acting and he do good job here carry most of this film literally on his shoulder the cinematography be eye pleasing and the music and atmosphere immersive together with sufficient run time which do not get long and tire these element make it good combo for film to watch if you have no good alternative the main problem in this film be the dialogue and generally the script its difficult to say this be great psychological thriller while its dialogue kinda suck luckily there be not that much dialogue in the second half of the film so you can enjoy bite the experience of thriller which be not mean to jump scare you but to give you an eerie feeling overall
entertain and enthral saw the preview for this few month ago and must say that all could think be this look weird after see it last night at the ny film festival as the closing film of this year festival come out more than pleasantly surprised don know what type of film the preview be try to make birdman seem like but it not anything like thought it would be inarritu the editor and the cinematographer incorporate style of edit which would have be impressive without any plot whatsoever it keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time almost to fault it almost exhaust have to keep up with it all the score by sanchez be bare but work great for the film and be aid by few visual representation mix in throughout the cast be more than up to the challenge as well especially keaton and norton who have few scene where they each get to flex their acting chop the rest of the cast doesn seem to get as much of chance to show off but do not make their performance any less impressive award for the four mention by name here could be forthcoming an entertaining film well worth the price of admission don let the strange preview fool you
move me in most beautiful way it be long time if ever since movie or anything else have leave such an impression on me everything about it make me happy it truly be masterpiece

special dark occult mystery film with lot of potential but really poor presentation of that mystery and lack explanation metaphysical mystery film group of young people go hike in the snow until one of them accidentally discover skeleton except the skeleton belong to host for something supernatural and the young man who discover him stop respond to his friend and act strange as he become the new host for that entity later we be transfer to the near future and to an independent story where another group of young people listen to story reputation decides to do it for fun and end up invoke the empty man the same entity that be transfer from host to host and that seem to exist whole cult behind it although the film start promisingly it continue at an increasingly slow pace and grow increasingly boring as time go on since instead of explain thing become more and more complicated no clear explanation be give as to what empty man be and the end be particularly strange and incomprehensible although there could be particular plot twist unfortunately like the rest of the film the twist of the end further complicates thing and the few explanation give to the audience be also overturn despite the good performance and the special script and the directing unfortunately the presentation of the mystery to the viewer be particularly inadequate so instead of enjoy special mystery film the film end and the audience win understand what they watch too bad not to explain why it have every prospect of become special film in the genre

to hell and back the pianist be an incredible film in many aspect roman polanski account of the survival of the pianist wladyslaw szpilman be document about how one man can overcome the bad possible situation in world go completely mad around him the only fault one can find with the adaptation of mr szpilman story by playwright ronald harwood be the fact that we never get to know the real wladyslaw szpilman the man as some of the comment make to this forum also have indicate there be very interesting point raise by the the pianist father who upon read something in the paper comment about how the american have forget them well not only the american but the rest of the world would not raise finger to do anything for the people that be be imprison and make to live in the confined area of warsaw the exterminate camp will come later what be amaze in the film be the frankness in which director polanski portray the duplicity of some jew in the ghetto the fact that jew be use to control other jew be mind boggle but it be fact and it treat here matter of factly have this be make by an american director this aspect would have never surface at all yet mr polanski and mr harewood show us that all be not as noble and dignify as some other film have treat this ugly side of war wladyslaw szpilman as play by adrien brody be puzzle sometimes in that we never get to know what in his mind he a man intent in not die but he not fighter he accept the kindness extend to him he never offer to do anything other than keep on hiding which be human instinct he will never fight side by side with the real hero of the ghetto uprise his role be simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe house across the street from where the action take place adrien brody be an interesting actor to watch as the pianist of the story he exude intelligence there be scene where szpilman in one of the safe house he be take discovers an upright piano one can see the music in his head and he can contain himself in move his finger outside the closed instrument play the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind the support cast be excellent frank findlay magnificent english actor be the father of the pianist and maureen lipman another veteran of the stage play the mother with refined dignity in watch this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that be currently brew in front of our eye we wonder if the leader of the different faction could be make to sit through showing of the pianist to make them realize that war be hell
well watch when young remember this movie to be so much good when watch it many year ago now it have lose its magic due to the acting of the two lead and outdated effect atreyu act be unimpressive when it come time for him to call out the gmork the scene look woeful where be the fight creature who have destroy all of fantasia say atreyu be the last lost interest before that but here have to laugh it only look like scratch on the beast and the time it take bastian to enter fantasia well not to watch it later in life keep whatever memory you have of it early my final remark memory may remind you of the next chapter
every cliché know to man or woman do you realise that the 2011 athletics world championship be hold in london no neither do the record book will actually tell you that they take place in daegu south korea but this film will tell you something different the reason be that the film be slat for release in june 2012 to cash in on the forthcoming london olympics and the original script have the character compete for place on the british team for those game unfortunately the producer have fail to realise that the international olympic committee take dim view of anyone other than an official sponsor cash in on their sacred game and that the commercial use of phrase such as london olympics and london 2012 be restrict by law law enforceable by some quite ferocious criminal sanction hence the invention of the fictitious london 2011 world championships lisa temple be white blonde rich and beautiful shania andrew be black or to be more accurate of mixed race brunette work class and also beautiful the name shania incidentally be pronounce shan eye ah it do not rhyme with tania apart from their beauty the two young woman have three thing in common they be fast in the sense of speedy rather than that of promiscuous despite that rather obvious pun in the title they be compete for place on the british 4 100 metre relay team and what be more they hate each other very much cue film which incorporate just about every sporting drama cliché know to man or woman there be the antagonistic duo whose initial mutual dislike turn first to mutual respect and then to friendship as they learn to work together as part of team there be the rich girl who at first seem like snobby bitch and the poor girl who at first seem to have massive chip on her shoulder but who both eventually turn out to be thoroughly good egg there be the pushy domineer parent in this case lisa father david himself former famous athlete there be the inspirational coach in the shape of shania mentor brian an amateur but far more inspirational than any professional could be there be the sudden unexpected stroke of bad luck when an experienced old competitor last chance at glory be dash by injury but thereby give chance to an up and come youngster there be the sudden unexpected stroke of good luck when great britain finish just one place away from qualification in the semi final just know what be come next and of course it come the french be disqualify for an infringement the french athlete unlike the british be all white wonder how many decade it must be since real french sprint relay team do not include single black member there be possible love rivalry between shania and lisa there be the inevitable heartwarming triumph at the end change the sport and the sex of the character and this could be story from roy of the rover comic despite the immense success of chariot of fire in the early eighty film about track and field athletics have be few and far between about the only other one can think of be the american personal best which tell rather similar story to fast girl except that the burgeon relationship between lisa and shania stop at the just good friend stage and do not become full blown lesbian affair as happens with the rival athlete in the other film yet this cinematic dearth do not just affect athletics there be virtually no film about cricket or rugby union and surprisingly few about such popular sport as golf tennis or even football think that part of the reason be that it be difficult to recreate the drama of live sport event on the cinema screen and part that it be difficult to write convince sport drama without rely on the sort of clichés set out above the script do occasionally hint at some more interesting issue such as the obviously complex relationship between lisa and her dad or shania equally complex family background it be even hint that one of their colleague in the relay squad be fast girl in the other sense of the adjective and have be sleep with potential sponsor despite be marry the film however seem to shy away from explore these issue in any depth lenora crichlow and lily james would appear on the evidence of this movie to be two gifted young actress this be the first time have see lily have previously know lenora from her role in the television series sugar rush actresses however be only as good as their material and hope to see these two in good and more original film than this one 5 10
there be brilliant film trap in here somewhere although really really like this movie must admit it not for everyone and here why the order encompass one or two intriguing idea go bit awry priest play by heath ledger be call upon to investigate the apparent suicide of his mentor and uncover the mystery of an ancient be the sin eater who be able to absolve the sin of those unrepentant sinner excommunicate person suicide normal catholic priest would be unable to forgive due to church dogma the knowledge of this creature force the priest to face his own conflicted feeling about the priesthood before he have even begin to sort out his confusion the large plot begin to unravel and he find that he have be at the center of it for long than he have ever realize well it would have be excellent if leave at that and flesh out for the 100 minute duration but it be not to be the best bit of turmoil and conflict of passion and temptation and surrender be skim through so quickly it seem as if someone think they be the annoy but necessary bit when they should have be the real meat of the film the rest be clog up mess of random and inexplicable demon child power hungry cardinal and bad of all love interest who have absolutely no chemistry with the main character an accent that be completely out of place confusingly pointless back story and who seem incongruous with the setting and plot sadly there be very few shot of the film location only one wide shot of rome in fact which could have be use to set the tone much more effectively than all those shadow and candlelight that all say there be many redeem feature the soundtrack be hit and miss but more hit than miss and at least it be never distract the duo of ledger and mark addy be charm and the chemistry between ledger character and william eden play by benno fürmann be sizzle that adversarial relationship should have be the focus of the film rather than sort of easter egg hunt during bit of the second half but it be more than enough for me to consider this movie an hour and half well spent
overlong film put audience to sleep captain america lack humor engage plot and script rely solely on special effect and promotion to get box office honor and to make matter bad it drag on forever it be silent audience for the entire 2 hour not chuckle be hear and when it be finally over the audience just walk out the door with not soul stay for credit or musical score from start to end this be just mish mash of unengaging computer imagery with so many scene of shoot em up violence shattered glass and chaos that it get bore within the first half hour camera work be shaky edit poor with overly long scene and actor either miscast or just read their line without impact and if there be music score sure don remember it and good acting just wasn there the captainamerica actor use faint persona draw from tom cruise who with his intensity and charisma would have raise the movie to high level his strong woman cohort play by scarlett johanson be especially lackluster with her only notable expression be frown occasionally and cast an age robert redford as villain be poor casting extraordinaire redford lack energy intensity and physical presence as an actor if you enjoy watch hollywood style extravaganza with 90 special effect and actor sleep walk through their line captain america be for you even our 14 year old for whom this movie be probably make say we should have go to spiderman
rick and morty the series be very funny in the first three season but in the fourth season the joke become bad and highly anticipate the series lose the thing that be characteristic of it the series be no longer as fun as the previous one if it end in the third season 10 10 the last season would have destroy the series recommend watch the first three season only
a movie too conventional for an unconventional anti hero let me just say off the bat that like this movie overall the action and the humor be both very good and ryan reynolds nail the role of deadpool with that say deadpool the infamous anti hero know for constantly break the 4th wall and just overall be unconventional be stick in way too conventional movie that doesn take enough risk deadpool in this film be very much himself and there plenty of rat humor the usual pg 13 marvel film try to avoid but in the end the film get bogged down by typical 3rd act finale the weak point of the film another forgettable marvel villain in ajax possibly the bad plus the typical support character like the love interest and goofy sidekick it all little too conventional for such an unconventional character in deadpool and the movie suffers
as good as modern invisible man movie can be leigh whannell be not subtle filmmaker at least that what use to think the saw and insidious movie be over the top and shock which be fine and enjoyed upgrade quite bit but be afraid the invisible man would fall into the same trap of shock value over substance thankfully be wrong from the opening scene the movie suck you in with tension and unease cecilia elizabeth moss be try to escape from her abusive boyfriend while he be asleep and with practically no dialogue or exposition we immediately understand the situation and feel for moss character she trap in an abusive relationship and fear for her life it a testament to whannell deliberate direction use visual cue to give us the information we need while slowly ratchet up the suspense the movie be not reliant on jump scare there be few but they re 100 earn and actually effective because we care about the character the excellent score help add to the atmosphere alternate between pulsate ambience and melancholy orchestral bit from the concise write likable character clever direct powerhouse lead performance and genuinely scary villain the invisible man get just about everything right suppose you could nitpick some of the logic but that miss the point it a film about gain freedom from toxic relationship and whannell know exactly how to pace the story so that we don spend too much time dwell on potential plot hole overall gripping and expertly craft psychological thriller
fabulous be invite to screening of this and go expect to be inform and intellectually stimulate which be but didn expect the movie to be so unbelievably entertain it start with the music of pete seeger and end with billy bragg two activist musician who greatly admire but along the way key scene dance its heart out to shirley and company you ll probably have to look that up suppose should have anticipate that since the uk miner strike of 1984 have already generate one great movie billy elliot with its own great dance sequence to rex the magic be there to be tap again perhaps it that maggie thatcher make such great evil queen villain but as shirley sings one monkey don stop no show so urge you to see this and have yourself grand old time this week ve see three movie that might be classify as message movie first love be strange which be all very moving and sentimental but which have so many script problem that at certain point it be really chore to ignore them then la grande illusion at moma which be certainly well script and construct but ultimately for me not very emotionally move this movie be so fast and fun and furious that if there be any problem ve long ago forget them and without doubt the message come through strong and clear and fabulous suppose should warn you that if you get steam up when you can understand every word of an across the pond accent maybe you should wait for dvd with subtitle also if you think of rupert murdoch be great australian er brit er american then this movie be not for you if you think that wild strawberry provide template upon which all movie should be base then this movie be not for you if however you think that kinky boot be not quite red enough there a double entendre there then buy ticket to this and have ball
yes man what disappointment have always love jim carrey movie and good laugh be guarantee but this movie be so contrived that it be embarrass can honestly say do not laugh once if that be what the director call wit then he have take backward step since the break up which be moderately funny the message be good one but it have be execute so badly that it really become cringeworthy at time zooey deschanel be only shin light in this movie but some of the line also make her look ordinary at time save your money hire another flick
would you die already okay everybody know that the movie be way to long it should have be cut to about the time they party make it to the elven kingdom the movie could have save bit of time by let the character die little more quickly but noooo the character have to give their final death line and then another and then another and yet again and then die and do they really have to show all the scene of them walk or run or boat for so long with the camera zooming over every hill and rock follow them like the country side bit it be bit much be fan of the book but have to admit the movie do open my eye about the series its about walking lot and die slowly well the later of the two be the movie not the book personally want my money back plus interest for make me watch all the extra footage that be not need
get out bad movie ever don know why this have 7 7 rating didn want to give 1 star to it
an unnecessarily long saga where lot happen by chance never write review but prisoner get my juice flow in bad way the film be way too long lot of unnecessary shot no real emotion no save the cat moment blake snyder on hugh jackman part and one of the most significant fatal flaw in my mind absolutely no humour not pinch it a gritty film and get it but please give me break an experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that be must from time to time now the inconsistency silly red herring and just plain stupidity why would the child killer go to confess to priest when his faith dwindle after his son die and they wag war against god the priest confirm that the killer be brag so what be exactly the point of go to the priest do not sound like confession issue to me fail why didn they get the priest to do photofit and connect the dot that way if you kill man you sure remember at least something of him why didn the maverick detective think about the old auntie husband go miss all those year ago and perhaps make some sort of connection nah it not good for the plot fail the same maverick detective solve all the case find everything out by chance by chance he see the cable stick out from behind cupboard which surprise surprise be hide secret entrance to secret basement and the priest never even thought of get rid of the body then by chance again the maverick detective shove all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila clue again fail why do hugh jackman character need to beat the retarded alex when the genius detective interview him it seem the phobia of human touch do the job plus keller never get anything out of alex although alex capable when the plot require to utter completely coherent and reveal sentence also everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father try to find his miss child where be surveillance oh my next point the whole police force consist of the genius detective his superior with an office couple of administrative guy and forensic team of 2 get outta here the genius detective do not only seem to have no training but lack in common sense as well why would you not close the first snake box and let the snake get out whilst you re open other box this be just idiotic fail everybody seem to be talk in riddle the girl that escape utters you be there everybody seem to hear it see keller run out like mad but for the plot purpose nobody reacts instead of question the girl who we ve just witness can actually speak they just stand around in friendly circle fail keller go to the auntie house know full well that she a serial killer and one in such extreme situation would gather very dangerous he turn his back to her and mutter threat for what know she could have knock him out with fry pan at that point fail the evil auntie weirdly seem to be repeat every command twice open the drawer 2 get in the car 2 everything repeat twice be the writer short of word what go on fail oh and note to the director try cut the scene down or eliminate the one with people just walk down the hospital corridor may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watch 2 5 hour film the story of which do not warrant this length the list go on yawn enough now otherwise may write into the early hour of the morning
mediocre crime thriller be elevate by good end what so special about se7en as fan of crime thriller zodiac be one of my favourite modern film expect this to be mind blow it a pretty standard mystery that way too long it alright certainly not classic brad pitt and morgan freeman deliver solid performance although it not enough to save this largely forgettable thriller the end bunk this film up to 6 10
some good but too much bad it not rami malek fault let make that clear he come through with fittingly outrageous performance and should be commend especially consider all the mistake take place around him his prosthetic teeth be cartoonish but he pull them off just fine he also pull off the voice the posture and the curious wander eye that that make manifest his burgeon sexuality that slowly become clear to him bohemian rhapsody the movie great problem be that there be no clear message or mean it intentionally eclectic and mixed but this concept work much good for the song than it do for the feature film it never quite reveal what it mean to say if it only mean to pay cutesy fan service to the adore freddie mercury and queen fan of the world then it a job well do if it mean to offer any other sort of statement about sexual expression or friendship or the creation of music then it mostly miss the movie great failure be its insistence on submit constant winking in joke about queen when mike myers music executive character say that no one will ever sing along to bohemian rhapsody while rid in car we all chuckle or at least we re suppose to the crowd around me certainly do but just roll my eye moment like be not as clever as the filmmaker believe them to be the other great failure come from an inability to make moment believable the lip syncing could be overlook even though it awful because no actor can reasonably be expect to make that perfect but it the director issue for not choose alternate angle to hide the mouth bad than the lip syncing be freddie relationship with his father dad be classic conservative who disapprove of freddie lifestyle the singing more so than the homosexuality we re lead to believe and that the entirety of their relationship until the cringeworthy resolution near the end it not even worthy of be consider manipulative because it so weakly execute another thing do freddie really not know he be gay until queen have be smash success for year everyone else seem to know and accept it that seem to be bizarre choice of the writer if you love the music and absolutely adore queen you ll probably like this movie but if you look to poke any hole at all in film itself you ll spring few dozen leak freddie deserve good than this
bob odenkirk make this film great some pretty decent performance but bob really take the cake here fun film to watch with some really cool scene and impressive cinematography it funny it intense it entertain and overall it just awesome
so what leave the screening after almost two hour because do not realize what this movie want to tell yes there be fine act bruno ganz be really great and it seem to be authentic but for what be it good for to watch the suicide of some nazi monster it tell you nothing except that these people remain true to their principle until death it tell you nothing about their crime it tell you nothing about their power it tell you only something about their character what nobody need to know the movie be also tightrope walk because it show the destroying of berlin it show many victim and it show the nazi trap in the führerbunker someone might get the impression all the disaster be come from the ally which try to conquer berlin

french corn often wonder at how much good film make in continental europe often seem to be than typical english language movie of course part of the explanation may simply be that as resident of england one only tend to see the best of european cinema and as if to prove the point here come hertabreaker film whose sole raison etre appear to be to demonstrate that the french can make romantic comedy every bit as drearily predicable as the american all the expected element be here the grand wed the affluent backdrop the preposterously construct plot the nymphomaniac best friend the character who fall in love without mean to the heavy reliance on familiar soundtrack and of course the eventual inevitable choice between two very different men just as predictable be the absence of any real laugh right at the end do wonder if the film be go to surprise me with departure from the normal end for this kind of rubbish win spoil the plot by state whether or not it do but will say that by this point be well past caring either way
a biopic or more like bio epic and fantastic one what night this be go to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazz when saw the first trailer didn think much about ramus malek as freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics be generic and pretty much formulaic back then even consider drop sacha baron cohen huge mistake but boy be wrong malek shin like he never shine before think susie figgis outdo herself as cast director here ever since join the casting industry really start see what it mean to work here how important this part of showbiz that be and how just single miscast can ruin project susie figgis be veteran cast director know for many big and widely love project and she do well here she do extremely well up until the moment join this business pay little to no attention to the actor ensemble with the exception of clear miscasts that just stand out and you couldn unsee it but yesterday just sit there mesmerize gwilym lee do an outstanding job portray brian may in fact forget he wasn him lucy boynton be one of my absolute favorites portray mary austin and her love and devotion towards freddie and ramus malek oh boy ramus be freddie mercury while be sit there in the theatre and staring at the screen didn have feeling be watch actor play their part felt like be watch queen don have much to say about the plot or the costume the set the cast everything be close to perfection perfect balance of drama and comedy exactly how life be be five when my dad come to me kneel put his large and on my tiny shoulder and deliver the tragic news about freddie pass queen be basically the soundtrack of my upbringing so didn take the news too well wept like ve just lose dear friend dad and spend the remainder of that afternoon blast the track we oh so love queen have be the soundtrack of my life therefore it impossible to have an unbiased opinion about rhapsody but must admit have my reservation at first but in the end love it the last twenty minute of the film spend sobbing and wipe the tear and mascara track from my cheek can remember the last time cry this much in movie and don know if it be the music freddie tragic fate or the relationship he have both with lover and his family or maybe it be an amalgam of everything but from the first minute the movie start build up it rise block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story be finally conclude and all the light turn on and it shin like marvelous gem until this day live aid remain the big most epic music event in the history of civilization and it be remember by million and _bohemian rhapsody_ do it justice malek do justice to freddie and leave my seat long after the credit have stop roll the show must go on and it do
it wasn the disaster think it would be after read comment on imdb actually expect the film to be much bad than what think it would be but it wasn the disaster think it would be will admit the film have few really dumb scene but really like the concept the main flaw lie primarily in the execution which could have be do ten time well lindsey lohan performance be average the guy who play the piano teacher in my opinion be actually the bad actor in the whole film the problem with lohan acting be her reaction especially when she suppose to be shock she be completely stone face overall it have the concept but not the execution it could probably have do with good cast and good direction but like it for the concept 7 out of 10 for the concept alone
what letdown it a letdown the fun and charm bit of harry potter be leave out of this film like k rowling work immensely so that hard to say plot wise thing be mess newt and his luggage full of magical creature be side plot to the important thing go on the real story be that an auror in new york be search for powerful and dangerous magical force that manifest within teenager his plan turn the destructive energy the teenager carry into weapon assume enter newt scamander who be try to transport thunderbird to arizona for release back into the wild some of newt other creature escape in new york and he have to round them up all while become entangle with the auror and his teenage target the plot sound sort of okay but it not well integrate the character don add up to much of anything either the sidekick baker be fairly likable though along with his brewing romance with queenie newt a bit thin as character eddie redmayne dialog also tend to come out mumble which make him hard to understand at time throw in few acronym and oddball word like macusa and that make for more confusion altogether the film need more work to tighten the story line and make fantastic beast story focus on newt and his menagerie instead of what we end up with
really terrible background flashing be bad than natural born killer plot be weird and then spider pig show up to make it even less palatable m not fan of the character or animation
fast and furious for people who like good movie movie about car go really fast but every shot look like great concept art and the character all have great development most of the cgi be great but some be shoddy don really care because it work with the cartoony fun of the action don listen to the soundtrack while drive
didn do anything for me under the skin be very poor movie with terribly write storyline and mediocre cast it dosen actually have plot we re just watch woman seduce bunch of men lure them away with her and then something strange happen that pretty much it the character do this to about eight men and the movie be over it suppose to be psychological thriller and it be but it never actually thrill or terrify me mentally which be clearly what these type of movie be mean to do the main character be never develop we aren make very clear of her motif until the end of the film which could have be an exciting thing to keep the audience interest it probably do for some people but have no interest in it whatsoever and simply find her suspiciousness irritate scarlett johansson try her best with this role but she couldn save it it a tedious film that you will leave have understood just as much as you do about it when you start bore drawn out and confuse wouldn recommend under the skin to anyone several men think their in luck when beautiful woman approach them but she have dark secret best performance scarlett johansson bad performance adam pearson
i don usually like these film but if there one film of this type to watch with your girlfriend or romantic friend this be the one m on mission to watch all of the imdb top 250 and be over 50 do when come to this title put it on and expect to have it play on the side while be browse the web but after the first couple minute know stumble upon something special it really be romantic suspense film you want them to be together but at the same time it send message to let yourself live in the moment and be happy with what be go on now without try to extend it it really film you can think about and discuss for long time the exceptional dialog drive the film and you can tell the chemistry between the actor be something special or else it wouldn work definitely something actively recommend to people in my life
spider man into the spider verse and with that the oscar lose the last bit of credibility they have where could even dream to begin on this one an animated spiderman film that sit at time of write as the 41st high rat movie on imdb and win an oscar who have think such thing be possible so the movie have be hype left right center and diagonally ve literally not hear one single bad thing about it but the fact mention above left me stun what could this possibly be to be herald in such way tell the story of young man who be also bite by radioactive spider and develop superpower kingpin late dastardly scheme be tear the fabric of reality apart and alternate universe version of spiderman have all end up in the same universe m sure you can work out what happen next so the animation style be tweak on pixar it play out like comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn work for me the animation doesn flow fluidly it look hokey disjoint and find myself frustrate by it the plot be novel concept and like it the delivery however do not certain aspect make very little sense sure it a spiderman film so m not suppose to think about it too much but do and my conclusion be migraine induce stupidity do say stupidity oh the stupid doesn end there sadly get the multiverse concept of anything be possible but their spiderman variant choice be bafflingly dumb and what you expect from saturday morning cartoon not blockbuster film it try to be heartfelt but come across half assed it try to be funny but come across childish it try to be action pack but the style of animation didn allow it to be do justice okay m slat the film right now so it probably sound like hat it which didn 6 10 be fair rating and suggest its above average and it be but m annoy at the acclaim that it be bath in 8 6 rating on imdb be you kid me and the oscar have lack credibility in my eye for year because of their ridiculous bias and genre snubbing but this right here be the last bit of credibility up in smoke m not say superhero movie shouldn be oscar worthy but this silly cartoon simply isn and neither be black panther but ll resist the urge to rant into the spider verse to me be no different than all the straight to dvd marvel and dc effort we see couple of each year the only difference here be the animation style nothing else set it apart just don get the appeal the good some great writinggreat ideathe bad animation hardly flowsunexpectedly sillyplot hole that be unforgivably stupid

well craft but mostly fictitious film about turing involvement at bletchley parkthis be well make and well act film with an important message however the danger with film like this be that the mass think they be get history lesson but in this case they be most definitely not the film take enormous creative liberty all the way through by add conflict where there none by portray turing as if he be autistic when he be not and by insert number of fiction about turing character and achievement perhaps the most glaring fictionalised part of the movie which will no doubt upset many historian as well as the descendent of those actually involve at bletchley be the lie that turing singelhandledly invent and build the machine that could break enigma code the machine be actually invent by polish crytanalysts before turing even start work at bletchley turing involvement come later when he help mathematician gordon welchman who be not even mention in the movie design new model that look for likely letter combination also want to mention that the conflict between turing and denniston play by charles dance be completely fictional and denniston family have take issue with the film negative portrayal of him denniston pick out turing base on his work at cambridge and turing never go to winston churchill to complain and denniston never try to fire him contrary to what the film depicts turing be an approachable person with keen sense of humour and be well like at bletchley there be many more inaccuracy such as his lack of knowledge of german his dislike of sandwich and the scene about his compulsion regard carrot and peas all of this be fiction could go on but ve point out the main issue want to raise so once again as with so many bio pic recent example be churchill and dunkirk an opportunity be miss and we be present with mixture of fact and fiction fiction that go well beyond what we generally call artistic licence to the point that people live today connect to those war time effort be deeply offended
no redemption for pitiful movie this movie be more of drama than action but that doesn matter because it would fail in either case viewer can accept the clichxe9 of the wrongly convict man but this case be deceptively against the grain our society already have predisposition to acquit any man of murder his wife predisposition to think it be impossible when the statistic claim the opposite for that reason alone this movie be dangerous propaganda and most often lie the character never become believable mostly because of the reason state earlier also because such men don wind up in prison the wrongly convict man always come from different background and class can imagine someone find this movie even remotely plausible in fact the viewer have no idea what the redemption be nothing make any sense 2

hollywood gothic with the spotlight on norma desmond one of the great movie character of all time play majestically by gloria swanson sunset blvd ooze hollywood gothic in story that be as bleak as it be timeless although the script protagonist be joe gillis william holden unsuccessful screenwriter and opportunist the heart and soul of the film resides in the character of old woman norma desmond reclusive movie star of year go by living in the past vain egocentric yearning for return to the camera what make norma so memorable be her singular strangeness those over sized hand gesture eye bug out ghastly makeup grandiose emotion and live with her servant max erich von stroheim in that overblown creepy mansion antiquate baroque and out of beat with the rest of the world crumble apart in slow motion norma and her world be bleak beyond word and yet there a humor in all that bombastic eccentricity and the film theme run deep as it turn on its industry overlord with sting indictment of hollywood suit cruel and heartless spit out actor and writer when they no longer generate money hollywood insider be portray thusly as desperate vain egocentric opportunistic shallow and delusional much like norma and joe indeed the hollywood savagery of 1950 look very much like the hollywood savagery of today thematically the film have not age at all w cinematography capture the story bleakness well set and prop be suitably specific and detail the film score be at time as grandiose and majestic as norma and wild stylistic and flamboyant directorial flourish add to the film supremacy my only complaint pertains to the script the voice over narration be bit overdone and the second half plot give little too much attention to the betty schaefer character it norma desmond that want to see and listen to these quibble aside sunset blvd be one of the great classic film of all time noir drama wonderfully dreary and grim yet funny too and that final sequence with norma descend the staircase address those around her in mannered whisper head tilt back all bug eye and never blink then as she look into the camera just terrific
chazelle fine after watch it million time over still can get why it so underrate it have beautiful plot line and captivate scenery if you love romance and musical this be definitely your cup of tea
fun to watch good for few laugh but way too over my head would say this movie be for certain people who be smart enough to remotely understand what actually happen back in 2007 the big short use comedy bit in which they would get people to explain complex finance to the dim crowd like margot robbie explain triple loan while bath in bath tub ll be honest with you do not fully understand but that be not important the style of them explain it to you be to grab the attention of the people who get screw or just felt screw because the bank screw up and screw us it one of those movie that get the left wing cheer cause it smartly expose something we all already know the best part of the movie be actually the performance of the actor steve carell be know for his comedic acting and he able to take that talent and put it into drama easily christian bale awkward genius be genius and bring some steady humor while ryan gosling be the key element of this movie he be charm and likable even though he be play the guy we should all hate overall it be great attempt by director adam mckay to dress up serious movie as comedy and it be really easy to like cause he exploit everyone harsh feeling on the real estate bubble burst
annoy maybe it entertain for some but can get over the lazy cliche write constantly drunk flight attendant drinking vodka on flight and sleep with passenger really they could have try bit hard as former fa the character be uterly annoy and none of the motivation be believable or really even probable which doesn even let me enjoy the comedy part of it the character especially the crew be bunch of stereotype the music be overly dramatic and the split screen get old
and where boredom dwells while be not fan of superhero movie or marvel in general then still sit down to watch hulk where monster dwell because my six year old son do enjoy them the story in this 2016 animate movie wasn particularly impressive and it be actually border on be ridiculous in my opinion my son do enjoy part of it but even his interest be fail throughout the course of hulk where monster dwell wasn particularly much fan of the art and draw style that they have settle for in this animated movie the line and feature be just too prominent and didn really look good it just lack that smooth feel to it that many other animated movie have and as for the character in the animated movie well be of course familiar with hulk and somewhat familiar with doctor strange and now do have another chance to watch yet another marvel movie wasn familiar with nightmare but for good reason wow that character be bad not just in motivation but also in dialogue and in everything he do in the movie for an animated movie to be enjoyable it need to have good animation which this movie really didn have and it need to have good cast of voice actor and actress for the various role now will say that they people they have cast for the voice act in hulk where monster dwell actually do good job wasn impress with hulk where monster dwell but then again be not marvel fanboy but even my son whom enjoy superheroes quite bit wasn color impressed with this 2016 animate movie either so be set on four out of ten star rating for hulk where monster dwell
don wast time look for love it will find you when you re ready under the tuncan sun by audrey well be wonderful story of people who start their life over after suffered broken heart the italian scenario be spectacular during the whole movie along with the music the house the people the tree and the beach be very fascinating in the movie frances diane lane be middle aged woman who find out her husband cheat on her with young woman during the divorce her lawyer advise her that her husband want the house as an alimony from the divorce patty france friend be very worried about her health she treat her to gay trip to tuscany as gift in tuscany francis spontaneously do buy home and during the process of remodel she gain surrogate family the house become metaphor of the transformation and growth process that happen to her in her life she learn that everything she ever want in her life she already have it
edward norton breakout role this be film that really delve into mentally unstable criminal and if they be for real or fake it and how somewhat idealistic lawyer that actually have conscience try not to send someone who he think shouldn be completely accountable for crime sent to go through the death penalty he be someone that really do believe in innocent until prove guilty system he be the type of idealist that want to believe that there be good in people and he be play superbly by richard gere who be know for play rich or successful businessmen but the performance that really stand out to me be edward norton acting by play these boy scout altar boy with issue his performance be actually very believable to the point you can see why the character play by richard gere would fall into it the detective aspect and the courtroom thriller part of it really do mesh together really well in this and the camera work be shoot in interesting way this movie do start off bit slow but it do pick up later on so for some audience it might need some patience to reap the benefit overall it a very watchable movie but doesn have enough to make it stand out classic movie 7 8 10
season 4 when heard that syfy be cancel the series after 3 season be very surprised since the beginning this show have have an excellent story interesting world building great cast and good production value think it be one of the good series on tv not just science fiction but include all genre be gratify to find out that amazon pick this up and be eagerly await its release well just finish season 4 and be please to announce that the high quality series have return my only regret be that for some reason think this season be 13 episode instead of 10 and wasn willing for this to be over have never read the book this be base on so that have nothing to do with my review will only say that to anyone discover this series for the first time envy you when saw s4 e10 get little sad that it be over season 5 look like it will be fantastic as well
be movie so bad now that film like this be consider great have movie become so bad these day that merely well execute totally formulaic film like the avenger be herald as an exceptional film sure this film hit all the mark and have some good one liner but once we expect film to be refresh and new star war while have obvious flaw provide us totally new universe with its own unique political conflict world and even its own theology the force its first twenty minute be mostly watch the story of robotic english dandy c3 p0 argue with chirp roll trashcan r2 d2 but amazingly enough lucas make that unique and crazy idea entertain the plot of the avenger be just your run of the mill comic book story line compare its plot to that of inception or the matrix or even back to the future or the good the bad and the ugly much of what make those film so great be that their plot be highly innovative you have no idea where they be go you always know exactly where the avenger be go along these same line psycho the empire strike back the matrix etc provide classic twist norman have go insane and have in his mind become his mother the film apparent killer darth vader the film main villain be reveal to be luke father the first half of the matrix turn out to have transpire in totally false reality nobody expect these twist what unexpected occurs in the avenger even its minor twist have appear in other recent film its most significant loki allow his own capture come straight from the dark knight gangster film before the godfather be just pulp the godfather transcend the genre just as unforgiven do with western the same be true about the dark knight the avenger doesn transcend it regurgitate do to death plot unlike the avenger the dark knight be more than comic book film it be entertain compelling yet it explore complex moral idea and its plot go in innovative direction do anyone know that the dark knight would end not with fistfight but instead with battle between the joker and batman for harvey dent soul scene that leave it open to interpretation whether the joker or batman really win in the end scene far more compelling than any sequence of destruction could ever be and do anyone not know that the avenger would end with huge battle with the avenger ultimately triumphant uncertainty about how plot will be resolve be what once keep the audience hook not the continual spectacle of fight and explosion in fact look at the imdb top 250 with how many of these film would you know exactly how they end if you be see them for the first time in fact apart from the cartoon be there single entry as totally formulaic as the avenger be and let not forget do you ever worry that any of the avenger would not survive if not then where be the real dramatic tension one of the thing that make the dark knight so compelling be that one of its two hero not only die but be also believably turn evil before he be kill and do anyone expect what happen to rachel dawes harvey dent girlfriend one of the thing that make psycho so dramatic be its main protagonist die halfway through the film great film serious or fun must make the audience feel that there be something truly at stake and do even have to go into how voting to give the avenger 10 place it on par with the all time great work of film art one flew over the cuckoo nest schindler list taxi driver apocalypse now citizen kane vertigo crime and misdemeanor 8 1 2 manhattan cinema paradiso etc vote of 10 for film like this diminish the worth of these work of art that explore the deep issue concern the human condition though ve bring up some film that be dark than the avenger or more serious that be not my complaint about the avenger at all star war the empire strike back back to the future the good the bad and the ugly be fun movie but they also have plot that go in unexpected direction have surprising twist introduce us to unique character the element ve list here be what make film exceptional and deserving of an incredibly high rating just well do totally formulaic movie like the avenger simply do not deserve the praise it be get of course this film do not deserve 1 out of 10 would really give it 3 or maybe 3 1 2 out of 5 star which be equivalent to 6 or 7 out of 10 on the imdb rating scale however until others don alter their vote to put the avenger more in line with where it should be in comparison to other great entertaining film of history my vote will remain 1 go watch the avenger few more time once you ve gotten use to the 3 the special effect the digital surround sound you ll see that the film be predictable the joke be so so and the violence of the fight and of the long climactic end battle actually get kind of bore if you re teenager still read comic or lover of comic book who always dream of watch hulk fight thor thor fight iron man then this movie be what you ve always be wait for but for the rest of us the avenger be not the tour de force it be make out to be oh wait sec just learn that there a movie base on battleship you know that dull board game for eight year old guess movie really be that bad if you compare the avenger only to garbage like that guess it really do seem great never mind

my favorite movie this be my favorite movie ever love everything about it the cast be perfect the song be amazingly write and perform and the setting be beautiful when first saw this movie wasn expect anything special be absolutely wow be not huge fan of musical but this totally surprised me first of the plot be really interesting it follow more of real life path with the couple not end up together like it do in almost every other movie this feel more accurate which make the movie so much good second the song be amaze could have listen to the playlist over and over again there be huge focus on jazz which be perform beautifully in so many different way not just elevator music also the star do an amazing job sing especially since neither of the two main character didn start their career in sing john legend be great too for his first real act debut and light fire be perform really well the movie start off with music number another day of sun which be choreograph and film perfectly next all of the shot be amaze with scenery that really fill up the set the lighting be also breathtaking with one scene in particular which be breathtaking everything about this movie be perfect
insulting will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly write in some review just add this in order to contradict the hype that have allow this movie to be rank so high in imdb the same have be happen with other movie and that be shame for imdb which be become unreliable want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie be try to figure out how you can invest so much money in script that continuously make fool of the average critic intelligent viewer the story be not complex it be deliberately confuse in order to conceal its stupidity nothing that really matter be explain in the movie and there so many embarrass clichés the recruiting of the team the episode in mombassa the assault of the ice fortress many of the action sequence the average viewer must be disappoint and the dream which serve as the scenario to most of the movie be populate by the utmost lack of imagination finally there the score louder and louder building suspense that be never there for everything be dream and we do not quite catch what there be exactly that can go wrong well all in all the movie be an insult to the average intelligent viewer and have be direct by christopher nolan an ultimate disappointment
disappointment it be quite noticeable that the simpson have be on downward spiral since around the tenth season first of all it clear that every single possible scenario have be play out and overdo the animation have become computerised and boring and their be clear desperation as every celebrity with ant interest in the simpson be pull in to boost rating now imagine all of this and stretch one of those story over three episode and you get the simpson movie the first difference between the original simpson and the movie simpson be that the original be set firmly on take realistic observation and exaggerate them for example take itchy and scratchy this be what make it such classic because it be unlike any other cartoon however the simpson movie be base on very little and overly exaggerate this make the movie seem like bad copy of itself the second criticism of the simpson movie be that the simpson be always the big character and the contributor to the comedy but it be the small character that give the simpson that variation therefore give these character minimal screen time limit the film to only one story line when the film would have be much more interesting if the event be present from the point of view of some of the minor character however the simpson movie as separate piece of work to anything else be actually moderately funny in fact in burst it show some of the creative flare of the original 10 series however as complete film it be just disappointment and should have be so much good
good idea lose in the noise the central idea of inception be an interest one technology exist to enter other people dream in order to steal their most private secret or to implant new idea with christopher nolan of memento fame as writer and director this should have be smart compel movie unfortunately inception be bloat failure the root problem be that nolan replace the fascinating surrealism of dream world with lengthy outtake from james bond movie for example early in the film when cobb and ariadne be sit at café in dream world cobb tell ariadne to stay calm what go to happen be the waiter go to bring her glass full of wriggle eyeball be she go to turn around and see her best friend from high school have sex with abraham lincoln no thing start explode and that the whole movie in nutshell gaudy special effect and endless fight scene as poor substitute for imaginative idea the matryoshka doll plot of dream within dream isn nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine this be largely because nothing of consequence happens at high level once our hero have move on to deep level the high level support actor just fight off bad guy and overblown special effect until it time to bring back their colleague from the depth nolan should sit back watch few of the best movie by luis bunuel and david lynch and try again with one tenth the budget and ten time the imagination okay that never gon na happen but it my dream
great movie and even great performance you don know jack be one of the great movie of 2010 it show the life of jack kevorkian if you remember the 90s than you should have picture of dr jack kevorkian in your mind he be just as famous as any movie star he be the daily subject of medical discussion the movie show what truly be the intention of dr jack kevorkian and how he release countless people from their misery barry levinson direct the movie amazingly and as for the performance every one perform excellent but al pacino truly steal the show he prove why he be consider the great of all time by many he lose over 20 pound for this movie and develop physique so different than what he originally posses its amazing that he be able to pull of such physically demand task at the age of 70 al out do himself with each and every scene john goodman brenda vaccaro danny huston susan sarandon cotter smith and logan all do outstanding job in this epic movie you don know jack have all the element to keep movie fan at the edge of their seat if you haven have the opportunity to see this amazing movie than strongly suggest you see this movie and you will realize why its such phenomenon
fall of the galactic empire well many people tend to praise this sixth installment of the archifamous franchise although analyze it coldly it be the weak of the first three have always like star war movie have never be freaky but as kid as almost everyone like to have the doll of the movie poster and all that paraphernalia so well mount by lucas very intelligent uncle without doubt in when it come to make money in this third installment that concern us we have spectacular start very well do and excite the arrival of both the android as luke himself to jabba the hutt lair to rescue captured leia in her attempt to rescue her beloved han solo herself and who have be turn into sexy slave with one of the most erotic outfit that have be see in the history of cinema all that first initial part until the destruction of jabba ship in the well of the almighty sarlacc be masterful hilarious and unforgettable so what prevent me from give this delivery high grade very simple the second half of the film with the arrival of the protagonist in endor hit tremendous downturn that perhaps many do not know or do not want to perceive simply the whole teddy bear roll be completely leave over because it be too childish and even bore until that time star war have be saga for an adolescent adult audience but the inclusion of these ewoks already downgrade it to movie for kid which do not have to be but of course great public high income lucas be very very smart ve always say it the development well we be tell about the final echo that lead to the destruction of the second death star by darth vader ultimately redeem himself the death of palpatine and the end of the imperial dictatorship make the republic and the restoration of the jedi as guardian of peace in the galaxy all this in spectacular and very emotional climax with melody by john williams during the luke vader clash that freeze the blood phenomenal and very dark like many others prefer the original 1983 version in which sebastian shaw appear at the end as anakin skywalker and not hayden cristiansen mammon which do not stick with deadly tail in that scene since on top the effect be fatal and very force also don like modern fx additive in some sequence simply because they don connect well with the visual aspect of the set but this be just my opinion it be great sequel and conclusion of the first trilogy but due to erroneous decision that have comment some teddy bear make antic and certain high and low of rhythm and not very bright direction of richard marquand tie hand and foot as say by lucas which control even the small aspect of its toy as spielberg once define it make it not so satisfactory and round since it do not have the opera tone of the first two wonderful part
absolutely bore what be wrong with spielberg the post never get go even the part that they try to make dramatic with music and long long pause be terribly bore tom hank continually talk really really fast and meryl streep talk really really slow that the whole movie just save you 2 hour of your life please go watch something else anything

poor the simpson movie summer 2007 watch the trailer be excite the thought of homer cause springfield trouble and have to fix it would be great lot of interest character like moe ground kepper willy and mr burn look to be involve and wild homer scheming film would follow the opening with bart and homer be excellent the angered mob be funny which include abe however the concept be poor and the simpson family escape from springfield be dire the film quality plummet and reach it true low when homer be in alaska the short film mean short and boring story it go strange and take risky turn when homer be with the inuit woman the end be very weak and unimpressive now here how successful simpson movie should go same begin but rather than escape springfield homer marge bart lisa and maggie should unite and attempt to bring the town round to their side and scheme together to break out of the bubble for instance moes bar could play part as headquarters burn could fund it and provide power apu would become supply etc etc these be idea and just my thought think it would be much good than the escaping as it mean main and interesting character be cut out sideshow bob should be involve the secondary run story of bart homer and ned flanders could still be include but would be good and more interesting if they stay in springield great animation and draw some scene weak however and the comedy be average the usually varied comedy include subtle clever adult humour and obvious child gag be weak dull and monotone be very disappointed and be almost tempt to walk out of the cinema be pleased about the usual beginning and unorthodox credit include picture of the character be pleased to here the usual theme tune and opening scene it should of last much longer and include all the idea ve give this would create film worthy of the simpson title believe the writer be below par and poor it be an embarrassment to the simpson series sam carr

influential and unforgettable masterpiece fritz lang highly influential career as film director begin in post world war germany where he be lead figure in the german expressionist film movement and end in the united state in 1953 with the production of the big heat film noir classic perhaps his great film germany 1931 form an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir like the former it use strange and disturbing composition of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner working of the human mind like the latter it more realistically set its story in modern urban setting and blend in sociological issue along with the psychological and moral one even though be lang and germany first sound film many historian cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear follow the introduction of sound into film in the late 1920 while most early talkie return film to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginning and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibility of the medium avoid the failing by skillfully balance asynchronous off screen sound with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue the film edit particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contribute kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling of course many of the film sound effect be also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the film central character the stalker and serial killer of little girl han beckert magnificently play by peter lorre sound be also an important contributor to s rich and influential use of off screen space one famous example be the scene that introduce beckert as shadow against his own wanted poster creepily intone to his next victim elsie beckmann you have very pretty ball not only be beckert shadow bow toward lang expressionist artistic root but it ironically place the murderer in the implied space in front of the image that be among us the human community of viewer of which he be an innocuous appear albeit monstrous member another example of lang use of off screen space be the montage of shot whose common denominator be elsie absence from them an empty chair at the beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which elsie mother search compulsively and futilely for sign of her daughter arrival the attic play area that await elsie return from school most memorable of all and most often allude to visually in other film be the series of shot that indirectly record beckert assault and murder of the innocent child represent these off screen event metonymically via the entry of elsie ball from bush along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wire and off the left edge of the frame never in the history of cinema have something so terrible be communicate through such powerfully understated image beyond its technical brilliance the key to s lasting impact be its psychologically convincing portrait of han beckert twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial unlike contemporary cinematic example of the serial killer beckert be not present simply as grotesque psychopath nor be the issue of how society should deal with him at all clear cut to be sure the gut reaction of most film audience be to root on the underworld mobster and petty thief who beat the establish authority to their mutual quarry capture beckert and bring him to mock formal trial whose conclusion be foregone like many in america today beckert accuser be disincline to listen to insanity plea and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the sure way possible summary death penalty with as little fret about legal right as possible consider the heinousness of beckert crime and the imperfection of legal medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response be hard to resist yet be by no mean an endorsement of vigilantism quite the contrary through the unlikely rhetorical persuasion of beckert unkempt court appoint defense attorney and beckert own impassioned monologue lang strongly imply that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order be symptomatic of the social hysteria breed nazism in 1930s germany that the ruthless killer who head the underworld look dress and gesture like gestapo officer be no accident moreover the letter chalk on beckert back by one of his pursuer not only stand for murderer but also allude to god marking of cain while the popular misconception hold that the mark of cain symbolize his evil it in fact represent god warn to cain flawed fellow creature not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in god hand translate into secular term and literally enter the shot from the top of the frame god hand in belong to the legitimate authority that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try han beckert in the name of the law
appallingly bad have no problem with remake consider how much it cost to make movie these day sell something that people enjoy the first time make sense it a predictable return on the studio investment and it easy to market movie that just like so and so meet such and such so when studio want to remake an 80s buddy cop comedy with woman in the lead role say why not there be enough murphy nolte gibson glover and willis everybody role model out there how could you go wrong here how instead of rip off successful buddy cop franchise the heat have run scar meet the odd couple instead of completely unconvincing pairing of borscht belt ham and tap dancer they ve get sandra bullock playing yet again neurotic tight as and melissa mccarty playing yet again foul mouth slob these two completely unlikable and unbelievable character one an fbi agent who somehow manages to confound detection dog with her ability to find hidden drug and weapon despite complete lack of detection skill and the other boston cop who somehow manages to successfully work undercover in her own neighborhood despite be morbidly obese obnoxiously loud and wear the same clothes for day at time both be deservedly pariahs within their respective department who somehow succeed despite their own individual and collective incompetence and grow to adopt each other most annoying bad habit this movie play to an audience low dumbest instinct sadly it will probably be hit avoid at all cost
worth watch if you can get past the first couple of episode of season 1 it will get well like most show the first season be use to build the storyline introduce character so forth it be definitely worth give it shot be little disappointed that season 5 be be release an episode week after the first 3 episode but it give you something to look forward to each week now m highly disappointed that after amazon pick it up once syfy cancel that season 6 will be the last season but nevertheless fantastic show to get into
hollywood me and my wife figure it out movie for hollywood aabout hollywood outsider will be disappoint
philosophically bankrupt at best and dull at worst it seem hollywood be out of villain to attack so now it go after capitalism sure hollywood have attack capitalism before but now with the occupy movement and socialism on the public consciousness it have become the in thing to stand on the opposite side of the drive economic force that build america and scream how dare you it also painfully obvious that the occupier of hollywood can tell the difference between crony capitalism and laissez faire capitalism cosmopolis want to drive one point home successful business people be emotional corrupt bore with life and evil the premise of the argument within cosmopolis be that in order to achieve you have destroy you have to climb up the ladder off the back of the little man and once your up the ladder it not enough that you make the climb but you have to gloat about it this be why cosmpolis be philosophically bankrupt it doesn draw distinction between the criminal behavior of people that have make their fortune by destroy others on their way and the people that have make their fortune by trade value for value strip away the criminal behavior that be crony capitalism and you have the dollar as representation of value we trade value for value my job pay me amount of dollar to apply my skill set to their company for amount of hour day then use that money my time my life to buy the essential e food vehicle home of my choice if enter into an arrangement with someone to buy good from them trade the money have earn from my time spend at my job for this person good that have similar value to them we trade value for value when force enter the equation we no longer trade value for value force be coercion lie black mail etc this be the problem with cosmpolis its character act like prince or trust fund kid they act as if they ve obtain their wealth by no effort of their own they act like they ve no concept of value cosmopolis have cast of character that be wooden caricature of what the 99 think be hold them down it fantasy with flawed premise it philosophically bankrupt at its very best and its painfully dull at its very bad
not sure what the fuss be about not terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewer would have you believe firstly lot have be make of you need degree in quantum physic to understand the movie not so the premise be exactly the same as his last move inception time move slow the deep you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of black hole don need to be genius to understand that secondly lot have be make of his revolutionary mixing of dazzle science fiction and an intimate human story as for the human story it clunky and at time cringe worthy it dull and not particularly well handle with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the nolan film if you want to see movie where the relationship between father and daughter be far well handled watch contact as for the science fiction d have to say be disappointed part be very spectacular but be not impress by the planet scene iceland yet again and water planet with shallow sea and massive wave be somehow expect more than this overall grossly over rat by the critic yet go and see it all the same
a for sarcasm thought this film be absolutely hilarious and m not just say that because it have literary tie and 80s movie reference sprinkle throughout olive have bad reputation but it not really true she try to do the right thing and like everything else it spin out of control instead of try to be honest with people about her action olive chooses to roll with her new image and go all hester prynne on high school she loose sight of why she say what she do to start with and actually believe what people say about her the best thing about this film be the excellent sarcastic nature and dialogue that it possess olive be play by emma stone who have like the best attitude and sense of humor ever if olive be real everyone would want to be her best friend rather than ostracize her her humor come honestly because her parent be like the cool people ever stanley tucci and patricia clarkson be absolutely amazing as olive parent though the bad guy be really just olive reputation and rumor amanda bynes play the good christian girl to perfection sometimes irony be the best form of comedy like it so you will like it promise unless you don enjoy laughing or fun film which show the hypocrisy of our society then you win like it
overrate formulaic romance why be this film consider so brilliant how can it be classic it be just another shallow formulaic cliche laden hollywood love story typical of pre war hollywood for me this film be almost undistinguishable from that other great romance of the time the nauseate go with the wind at least casablanca doesn go on for several hour the usual plot of old lover reunite after many year once again in some hollywood interpretation of gratuitous exotic location bogart look depressed bergman look pretty and that about all there be to it no depth of thought or character flat commercial act from the lead even flat and more commercial direction and script if you like old movie from the 40s why not watch citizen kane there considerably more thought and originality there and ve never understood why people think the line here look at you kid or play it again sam be so quotably witty
good movie but best of all time hardly be little surprised at first to see this film rank 1 out of all possible candidate in the imdb user rating when think about it though it make more sense this be rocky type feel good movie that doesn really make you think and reinforce what we would all like to believe about human nature don get me wrong it a fine film give it solid 7 out of 10 it just not in my view up there with _casablanca_ and _the graduate_ guess the main problem have with _shawshank_ be the nature of the script and character think about it be there single person in the film who isn a one dimensional cardboard cut out with very simple motivation or hollywood cliche or stereotype we have in no particular order corrupt bigoted prison warden who be religious hypocrite for good measure brutal prison guard man who be wrongly accuse of murder an old convict who know all the rope and can live on the outside and convict who be murder by the brutal guard now where have we see this stuff before only in few dozen movie make from the 20s to the 90s there really nothing new here probably this come from the fact that the story be from stephen king who doesn really do well with complex character problem note as far back as _carrie_ if you want to see good prison picture try _cool hand luke_ from which this movie borrow considerably if you want an escape picture see either _the great escape_ or _papillon_ both with steve mcqueen or if by some chance you want crime and punishment movie that really make you think go with the late great stanley kubrick _a clockwork orange_ couldn stop think about the warden doesn he have family how do they feel what be they go to do now realize the story be inside the prison but wish the movie have make well use of its character than simply as simple mind symbol of evil or virtue m not mr cranky do enjoy the movie but enjoy it the same way do an italian dinner at the olive garden well construct genre product with nothing special to commend it 7
i love this most critic dislike it if have read the critic would have ignore this film read good review in the sunday express and go to see the film and like it lot will give no plot spoiler but if you like tough but not dumb crime film you will like this one it do not have the big budget or the big action sequence but it be good film the plot be fine but the film also benefit from good location and talented cast see this if you get the chance think you will be glad you do

declare triumphant in the field denby of the new yorker herald pixar animation as example of moral fable and damn the old disney one as mere psychological fable mark by cloyingness and malevolent overtone well up be full of cloyingness and weirdness and the latter part of its adventure have its fair share of malevolence up be hugely overblown fantasy whose point be lose in endless violation of the law of biology and physic pixar have its ups and down feature different writer and director and to typecast them be dubious what they have in common be technology and look the look be mainstream as be the sensibility if you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous you ll go to french animation like persepolis or fantastic planet or ear of the dark the triplet of bellville blow away the similarly dark american film coraline eastern european animation have fresher look the world of japanese anime be rich fantastic and frequently very adult or sexual it seem to capture the original fantasmagoric world of comic book well than american comic base film like the batman franchise likewise graphic novel film like frank miller sin city go far beyond the tame confines of pixar or disney an adult animation like waltz with bashir be in another league it a bad start for up and not step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you re force as you may be to watch up in 3 the glass on top of your own weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed image with the planar level they create be as flat and fake look as your grandmother stereopticon slide this fifty movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic spec be unconvincingly herald as the great new technology it didn do much for the creepy coraline the fascistic u2 3d still less for the slipshod jonas brothers the 3d concert experience and it only detract from zemeckis watchable beowulf 3 be suppose to look incredibly real but even grant this dubious claim why use it for up which flaunt its unreality its digital figure be like paint toy its paradise fall look unabashedly like paper mâché rock and fake foam the pixar image pop out at you without the effect of 3 image the color be brighter and the experience be more absorb why not let us use our own imagination there some thrill of adventure in this movie and certainly the titillation of swoop flight and dive through space as well as the time honored animation scare of teeter on precipice and go into free fall only to be magically save but this compare to the best pixar film get lose in its gimmick at the cost of meaningful tale of course travel yarn be just one thing after another anyway and there no harm in an adventure with the moral of good deed attack to it but that just what it be though attach and how much rich be the world of wall ratatouille and the incredibles up have less to offer to adult than they do
earth to echo echo echo echo echo love it wish could leave the review at that it can be classify as found footage it more of home movie which be good sign that some people be look at the genre and find way of put actual creativity into it it be reminiscent of t and just like the film that touch my childhood imagination this film do so to my adult imagination the titular character echo be cute and have nuance that reverberate with me long after watch it you could call it modern day remake of t but just because it have similarity in theme and plot element doesn make it so echo have life of its own and out of the 60 movie have watch in 2015 thus far may the 6th this one have come out in the top five and doesn look like budge
definitely not my cup of tea this movie isn my cup of tea couldn watch it all since lose interest but form what saw it just wasn good just find it bore with pretty bad acting and plot that be all over the place it a russian make movie the second have see now the first one be nightwatch didn like that movie either it also have plot that doesn make lot of sense at least in my opinion anyway mirror war start off promise enough with some scene of jet fighter do maneuver which look pretty impressive after that though it not so good wouldn recommend it myself but if you like nghtwatch you might like this movie for me mirror war be 3 10
the view be beautiful and the director pay attention to every detail it be pleasure however after spend nearly 3 hour watch this film could not tell any meaningful thing from this movie this be story about person normal life except this person be get young not get old maybe the director want us to let thing go when they become out of control we need to face them and accept them peacefully what be more really don like brad pitt how little acting skill he have anyway this be neither good or bad movie expect something more before watch this
i appreciate the nostalgia of the film watch this film in level medium study because we be study the sci fi genre metropolis 1927 be where the sci fi genre really begin at the time metropolis be the most expensive silent film ever make and its clear to see why it be clearly well ahead of its time with visionary idea the special effect be amaze for there time but be now obviously very date the problem be that the film be quite boring after while and only recommend to watch for nostalgic reason rather than for excitement and entertainment
it do have its moment well be not really of think see this film but friend tell me it be good movie go to see it with some friend its not the great live action movie have see but it do have some good moment the story be about yogi bear and his friend try to get people food at the park and always end up get into trouble like they do in the cartoon have not see the cartoon before hope its any good because this movie be bit disappointing film but all theo tom cavanagh have save this film not lot but he save some of it this be probably an underrated film but its an okay movie thats it think imdb be bit harsh on this film because some of the moment give lot of the time to think its an okay movie and to me its an okay kid movie because it be quit silly and bit disappointing but okay this movie be probably an okay movie for kid but don expect any thing great an okay it do have its moment give it 5 out of 10 okay
fabulous wow this movie as so good mean jennifer garner be the best actress ever to play elektra man you get to see that movie it rock mean the fighting scene be just genius and can believe they do it with real weapon the story be so great with abbe try to do like elektra such fun plus the guy be cute expect something really boring since people seem to think it be bore and not cool at all but it be well than daredevil and really do hope they will be another elecktra because this one be so so so so so so so so so so good you get to see that movie elecktra outfit be way well than in the previous movie and the way she use sarcasm and the old man omg he so philoshophic with everyone though didn like elecktra kiss another guy than daredevil but in the dvd in the deleted scene we see ben affleck daredevil come back for elecktra
unique but not good look be fan of chris nolan or at least use to be his movie be always different and like them prestige be the first movie that watch of him and love it the dark knight be the movie that have the high expectation and it do not let me down know there be 10 thing not to like the dark knight but for me there be 1000 thing to like but this time be disappointed inception be like the cutest car that can run very fast it have its good look but no good plot and million question about the concept there be few simple rule about science fiction movie or story when you watch one there be thing you feel right or not you can use your wild imagination but at some point they have to make sense this film certainly do not feel right this be like low budget science fiction which start well but lose it after while except for this be big budget movie well there be few thing to like about this movie it have good concept good graphic and good acting if the plat be well and few more thing make more sense this could have be the masterpiece everyone think it to be
crap in 1990 we have several crap film this be one of the film where govinda take break from his non stop comedy and do an action film though they be comic role too for him the film be another double role by govinda one be serious cop and the other be rajnikant fan who copy him the film be typical action film with lot of nonsense like the entire climax where the goon make funny sound when get hit even the way govinda kill the villain be hilarious there be several more stupid scene direction be awful music be bad govinda do well in the cop role and do well in the rajnikant take off role too but overact madhoo and shilpa be as usual amongst rest shakti kapoor and all the goon include ishrat ali do their routine
animated movie of the year winner 9 10 mile the main character portray it role so wonderfully honestly the one thing think hold the anime genre back sometimes be the storyline but this one do so fantastically you ll be hook within the start stretch funnily the movie be fill with introduction of all the spider creature which be bit repitatve but safe to say necessary for the storyline this good animated movie don come much offen so what be you wait for grab some popcorn and take leap of faith
surprisingly bad go into this movie with semi high expectation after love the cartoon series in my childhood and this nearly wreck that love for me jason lee david seville in the film be horrify understand it can be easy to act with cgi character who aren actually there but really find his performance atrocious along with all the other non animate character the chipmunk be adorable yet sometimes blatantly obvious at move the plot of the story along and therefore do not tempt me to stay in the theater for long than half an hour into the film if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most it be not worth eight buck to see it in theater unless you like good laugh at the horrible acting
why be this movie make this film be pointless exercise in waste celluloid researcher find an imprint on typewriter ribbon and decides to investigate his discovery apparently there be these area know as zone which can cause the dead to rise and attack the living it hard for anyone to prove since no real zombie actually show their rotting face during anytime in this painfully slow yawner there be little aftermath violence where we be witness to the slaughter of research group but that about it in the gore department nothing get resolve and the end feature the strange choice of sound effect have ever see in horror film as die hard zombiphile rate this film as the bad zombie movie of all time perhaps the bad horror film of all time well yet probably the bad film of all time please check out film direct by george romero lucio fulci lamberto bava or jorge grau for movie that actually have zombie in them
annoyingly predictable queen be decent actress but this show be waste of time and talent of her and chris noth the original series with edward woodward be good the film with denzel be good this incarnation be not all the scenario have be run don waste your time
start well then go downhill rapidly plot hole be ridiculous and bearing in mind the trouble that occur in belfast historically you have think people would lock door and windows thankfully it only 17 episode long so doesn eat up too much time to watch
claustrophobic and long wind kill bill volume 2 isn really sequel grant it be call volume 2 but really it be one film that have be split into two this volume be technically complete follow on from the first one so it be highly recommended to watch the first one and then possibly straight into this one didn take on this recommendation so it take me while to remember the pivotal point in the first one in order to catch up with the second do yourself favour if you be plan on watch this film and watch the original first volume 2 begin with the shoot out at the wedding chapel where the bride thurman be leave for dead by her former team of assassin this be what send her on the journey of kill all those involve in her betrayal in the first one we see her destroy many who be involve and partake in many huge fight sequence in this volume we continue on with her journey with the only three leave to be kill budd madsen ellie hannah and bill carradine her first target be budd who have be warn by bill that the bride be on her way budd put in plan to stop her in her track and when his plan seem like it be work it be very disturbing basically he begin to bury her alive her next target be ellie and obviously eventually bill the man who ultimately betray her on route we see some flashback that tie up several plot hole of the first film and to just why and how she become the big assassin that she be claim to be win indulge too much into what happen m sure you be all aware that she will plough through them and have her face to face with bill but it be the way she gain her revenge that be the shock there be not as much action and violence as there be in the first film but when the action do kick in it be rivet the bride and ellie standoff in fantastically choreograph fight sequence and there be some nice touch when the bride be taught her kung fu by her master all pay homage to old school kung fu movie as well as have action also find this film slightly scary sound weird as it isn a horror but there be moment that be quite frightening claustrophobia be bring to the max here and that be what be scary at one point the bride be bury alive and her reaction make you believe you re in there with her which would make it even more claustrophobic the sweat drip off her head help you feel the heat she be also feel tarantino do great job of highlight all this by use minimal light and some tense camera angle this scene be uncomfortable also there be scene with poisonous snake which jump out at you this be frighten to me as hate snake watch it slither across the floor and attack helpless victim really spook me out the final scary moment be one that will make you grimace fight scene culminates in an eye be gauge out this also feel claustrophobic as you can just imagine the pitch blackness this person have be plunge into to me this be horrific it isn suppose to be scary but find it to be at certain point as can really remember the first one be struggle to really decide on how good this film be it be alright at time but at other time it become slow and have lot of talk and tell us what be go on this though be typical tarantino and lot of his film do have much time give to character talk not that this be problem but at time it cause me to drift out of the film much of it keep me on the edge of my seat but other part lose little interest the acting be good in the film carradine be excellent as bill and thurman as well as look gorgeous really bring the character to life the plot be over strung but the acting and camera work help you to ignore this this be typical tarantino film and if you love him this will be big deal if you don then it will probably just be average
philosophical and poetic if you be go to watch this movie you need to give yourself adequate space to do so this be philosophical movie and not exactly easy to watch it come across more as visual poetry than anything else and therefore win appeal to mass audience which be partially the reason for rather low score on this site in my opinion it deserve more the reason for this be that firmly believe movie have to be critique on the basis of it type you shouldn judge this movie on the basis of all movie but other movie of this sort which be close adaptation of novel pack with dense dialogue and philosophical themed subject matter the question you re look for the answer to be should watch this movie and yes you should but curb your expectation to what type of movie it be in it genre find it thoughtprovoking and streamline it a limo slowly be cover by graffiti something cold perfect and seamless be torn apart from within you will find no typical storyline and no lovable character at several time think to myself that these character be in fact portray computer assess and process information and various symptom of the human condition people do not talk like they do in this movie the movie be very well execute and absolutely worth your time if you be interested in this type of movie that be and if that the case it will likely leave you inspire in some way because you be constantly think throughout
aside from any morality issue this be just really bad movie look through the review of this film it seem some people give it bad score because they disapprove of the subject matter but it doesn look like anyone just give it bad score purely as cinema so let me be the first sometimes you know movie be go to be bad from the first 15 second and this be one of these film begin with long artsy shot combine with tedious minimalist modernist score the film try to scream important and succeed in scream pretentious the movie then play interview over recreation of scene those recreation be tedious and uninteresting the movie also doesn begin by tell you what it about m not sure when it do get around to that because after few minute know there be no way could get through this decide to fast forward and see if the movie ever get anywhere and kind of get the impression that by the halfway point they be still talk around what happen could be wrong since it would be insane to do that especially since most people watch would have some idea of the subject matter but anytime slow down and take look it be just more tedious banal talk about nothing in particularly over arty cinematography this seem less of documentary than of muse upon subject normally if ve only watched five minute of movie don rate it because think it unfair to effect the movie overall rating if don know what m talk about but m make an exception for this one because it pretentious student film maker approach be just too utterly agonize to give pas to why be no one else say this the only review saw that take the filmmaker to task for any of the bad film make mainly be lunatic diatribe against liberal and homosexual horrible movie can believe it get such high rating
nothing special maybe it be milestone in the film history however from the present point of view the story be neither attractive nor surprising so the proper grade should be 5

well it have style don know absolutely love the look of the movie but find the plot lack felt this movie could have be call death wish 2000 swear if there be any justice in this world charles bronson would have have stupid cameo in this movie film consist of murder rock musician come back to avenge his death and his girlfriend assault watch him kill one of the guy who have attack him then watch him kill another and another see him rip cheesy guitar solo from atop an apartment building but again at least this movie have great set design unlike the death wish movie which have almost nothing go for them
two scoop of pretentious cup of mediocre and dollop of crap have never want 2 hour of my life back more than do when saw this movie everyone know saw it before me and after all the hype couldn wait m huge beatles fan and think the idea of beatles musical would be awesome mean hey cirque do it with love and they succeed the movie have to be good right wrong want so badly to give it chance but within the first half hour could tell that the plot be severely lack character like prudence be horribly underdeveloped you could ve take her out altogether and the only thing that would have really change would that you couldn include want to hold your hand or dear prudence and speaking of the former that number be just one of the many example where in the movie you think they be try to lead up to something and then they drop it altogether they include random and stupid thing just so they could use few more song and why do people buy into this crap because they re too distract by the music to care the cutting edge graphic as ebert call them be among some of the bad ve see in year they be quite obviously fake and cheesy and you could argue that it mean to be as such because it a hallucination or whatever bs you want to throw at me but if it really be hallucination it should at least be believable after while all of the garish color and pompous pseudo artsy camera angle make me nauseous that not even half of it and haven even get to the music yet know nothing compare to the beatles but they didn even try the music be so halfhearted and some of the spin they put on them just back off helter skelter be ridiculous and want to slap that actor for ruin revolution there isn a single song enjoy in all wish have never go to see it don waste your time or your money on this pretentious bull

kind of mean spirit not all that entertain and strangely out date to boot most of easy 2010 end up come across kind of mean spirit especially in regard to its minority group it perpetuate some pretty out dated stereotypical ideal surround the need to fit in even if you fake it and the outsider status that apparently come with any kind of non conformity these element both feel decidedly out of place in 2010 picture consider that society and even high school itself have already move past that kind of thinking for the most part at least there also an issue with the flick playing into the sub genre wider problem of sexualise teenager which be normalise somewhat since adult actor be portray the young character and the sense that the film add to the problem of gender imbalance when it come to the perception of sex itself it a good step forward that the picture have female lead don get me wrong but the way it handle its subject matter almost seem to do more harm than good there be few more specific story problem with the keenest of which be that our hero proactively get herself into most of her own trouble without much development do to explore why which make it slightly difficult to empathise with her or some of her action at least and reduces wider audience investment the end itself also isn so much solution as brush under the rug and hope nobody notice overall the feature be just not funny or all that entertain either and it pretty difficult to see what the point of it all be aside from push few generic and frankly unfulfilled moral that should be obvious to begin with 4 10
one of the bad movie ever love to bring up this movie in casual conversation someone say that be pretty good movie but after point out 2 or 3 thing they usually admit that it not good movie in any way the plot have hole big enough to drive mack truck through soldier who die in declared war have their death cover up why everyone in the world know here they be and what they be do man be keep in prison for 30 year with no charge and no conviction and no one notice dozen men can steal dozen weapon of mass destruction include missile in 10 minute with dart gun seal can figure out how to open locked door you get the idea can get through 3 minute of this movie without shake my head in disgust

there be no need for the distract love triangle be excite to see film that portray 1930 england and ralph fiennes and carey mulligan be proven actor that bring unique presence to their film archeology might be tough sell for the premise of film and it be these actor that draw me in the first half get it so right it just about the time period and character dig while become excite as they unearth the past it rather simple yet these actor have no trouble keep you interested in fact it be refresh to see english people present on screen become excite over find evidence of their ancestor and past to this ancient land give the current hostile attitude towards the english and celtic people by particular political group and medium company who like to remind us we have little culture and heritage then suddenly it as if the writer think viewer would become bored and in come new character rather modern behave liberated female with her control husband insert into the plot to remind us how woman should really behave in the current age as if we need remind the key character become background noise and you have this love triangle develop the film take on different purpose d rather see more character development between the man who discover the relic and the museum try to take credit from the little man
bilge what an awful collection of clichés and bilge this be the character use the term loosely be hysterical and each in possession of several tic of personality they don interact they merely display their own idiosyncrasy with no reference to anyone else it really be that bad like most american film involve the military there be virtually no indication of any professionalism at all people lose temper shout go ballistic for no reason and play the maverick which be either the true state of the american military or the hollywood take while sean connery be competent here nicholas cage be most deservedly not perhaps in an attempt to keep up with connery professionalism as an actor cage shout all the time and overacts terribly in every scene the two share the result be cage look like an amateur don bother to watch this

disappointing and without laugh as longtime fan of the simpson myself eagerly wait for the movie to come out as early as the mid 90 when the itchy and scratchy movie episode come out whose ideal felt would make their way into an eventual simpson movie over the year it have seem unfortunate that the quality of the show have be decline joke that lack luster and feel that the show be attempt to compete with bit lower brow show family guy at level that it didn seem to ever belong waited with anticipation hop that the movie would rise out of the past few season and be laugh riot it start out well enough with an ichy and scratchy short but fail to even bring out laugh during the entire movie few others in the theater be laugh either few moment bring about smile but for simpson movie it seem promised that tour de force of the different character and perhaps few more guest star would be involve in the plot maybe be expect too much but after more than decade it seem that the movie be big letdown weak humor mediocre plot and spider pig that overall bring little to the comedy of the movie it seem like it could have be well write into 30 minute show make this movie almost waste of already huge theater price it wasn plot well enough to provide many inside joke for the long time fan although springfield gorge come up but it be also difficult to newcomer to really understand the outside character and their personality wait for the dvd d say fan of most more mature theme animation comedy simpson family guy south park the venture brother and aqua teen hunger force whose movie haven see yet the simpson have be an all and out favorite for many year but after see the movie it clinch think that perhaps the end of the series wouldn be as horrible as it may have seem few year ago as south park episode once mention the simpson have do everything and that seem to be the case it be good attempt that be reflective of the past few season if you re into that sort of thing but for us fan of the 90 simpson it be just disappointment thanks for many year of laughs simpson but you re just too wear out
refresh when first read slew of positive review in 2013 about oculus really want to check it out really enjoy the horror film genre however it a real cynical bunch of viewer not scary enough not enough gore this have be do before and with the review come down like never see anything like this be interested and skeptical oculus be slow burn it slow and keep to this pace throughout the film this isn the conjuring which be pretty much fast pace this remind me of mix last exorcism of emily rise and perhaps the orphanage you will either get really interested in how creepy the film get or not you will either really dig the layer of how thing work in the horror realm or try to poke hole through everything ex 30 ft safe radius the genius of oculus isn the concept haunt mirror but the screenplay of disjointed story telling and flashback mix into coherent and perhaps complex story think of it like tone down inception it effective because you eventually feel and question what be reality and not this be above mediocre but perhaps not for the mainstream it a great refreshing horror film
