bore movie think it be completely different unsatisfactory in the treatment of their hand go in the first scene will put marble treatment it be scene of marble do not need after all ambiguous word be describe in only symptom but not bear when have talk to usually lose any stuttering be not enough variety to image unknown intent but keen to get on the elevator scene also subtly laugh truly boring movie good movie would be short can not feel empathy in that it rely on lot of event happen or even that of big brother to become king or of conflict much to overcome in certain sense we have to or mixed with little train scene also show how to show it to be able to become speech be not felt feel he have become somehow even to frigidity of disease here but will have another movie heal catharsis be the movie of the mystery be entirely enclose within do not fit or to overcome terrible and then go to the next scene the last minute rather than the depiction that be terrible speech almost slip
a spiritual masterpiece hail the woman be one of the most moving film have ever see in my entire life watch it twice in row and sob my eye out this silent film masterpiece deserve much wide view audience unfortunately the sole surviving print be so badly scratch that most people win watch it all the way through and they will miss the gem shin underneath the rough this film could use digital restoration to help bring out its beauty but doubt it will get it from anyone since its main theme be spiritual restoration before christ of the family unit and this be not politically correct these day however it remain powerful theme for those whose heart be hurt from the pain of broken family relationships the cast be magnificent especially florence vidor who literally glow as judith the daughter ethereal madge bellamy as nan the poor girl who get pregnant and be cast aside theodore roberts as the crotchety old domineering father who destroy everyone around him through pride and handsome lloyd hughes as the son david afraid of his father but really of life itself this be nice film to watch at christmas especially you will not regret be patient and view it in its entirety despite its deterioration
what so good about it go to see the movie because so many like it even win golden globe oscar nomination but really fail to see why such fuss over it the plot wasn bad but the pig spiderman be bit much
i think be watch different movie this be silly comedy star the monty python troop where they play king arthur and the knight of the round table embark on journey in search of the holy grail while encounter silly obstacle at first thought be watch different movie but the gag during the opening credit really catch me by surprise and send me laugh out loud very eager to know what the movie hold the plot start out slow from the beginning but slowly pick up steam as the movie approach the middle from the king and his knight holy grail search to the comical bloody sword fight and funny witch hunt there be smack of slapstick comedy here and there but it be the dialog and human interaction that will make you chuckle you also need to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild to enjoy the film the special effect how ever low budget they be be do pretty well the cinematography and color be also good and the acting be ok little wooden at time it be nice to see john cleese in it the only actor recognize in the movie overall it be worthy comedy ve see funny thing though you need to know and appreciate british humor to enjoy this movie grade
beautiful what beautiful film think it too late to say this one it a must see don mind the negative review
great vanity and presumption than quality this film be the end of trilogy that start very well but end up derailing quickly extremely ambitious and very original it be difficult to keep the flame burn throughout three film this film in particular be the immediate continuation of the action of its predecessor and suffers from the same problem and flaw although it be slightly well in my opinion the film continue to look cool and to rely heavily on the style that it create right at the beginning of the film the action and the strong special visual and sound effect be still there and continue to make everything look incredible but it no longer surprise us and it just isn the same anymore the same go for the soundtrack which no longer have the power felt in the first two film the script continue to tell strange story but that be still not the problem the problem be that the film seem to want to bet on everything without actually do so and so we have for example the merovingian reappearance without this bring any positive additive to the film ie more than cameo this be just to give an example of how strange some of the script option be the film also have dissonant and uneven rhythm that make certain part of the film drag as if they be die the actor continue to look good and think they seem to me much more human in this film than in any of its precedent the problem be some of the dialogue which just don make any sense think the director of the film let themselves be carry away by the success and the recognition and at certain moment they think they be make gigantic masterpiece of the cinema and that this end up be reflect in the film give the feeling that the film want to be more than it be and that be always boring instead of do job that could match the quality of the first film the director fell asleep under their own laurel
how on god green earth do this work so well the world of superhero movie and superhero comic be not as similar as they seem on the surface currently film studio be all about the extended universe see how many different title and character they can shove into one franchise avenger men justice league making for an easy way to squeeze few extra buck out of their lesser know property comic have this as well of course however they also have something modern movie haven really tap into yet story one offs chance for storyteller to create unique tale and not be constrain by the implication on or from the large universe spider verse get to do just that while playfully take on the fun if convolute absurdity of extended superhero universe listen hear you how could we possibly need another spider man movie spider verse understand that question and have take on it yes peter parker be here in fact there be two peter parker there also spider woman noir spider man an anime spider girl robot and spider pig at the center though be mile morale an afro hispanic brooklyn teen who must help these other spider people get back to their own plane of existence he fight with his cop dad he adore his shady uncle hate be simply the smart kid in the room and just want to do something that matter be spider man wasn his idea but hey when radioactive spider give you power what choice do you have look don have any sort of hot take on this movie it look great the humor pop with surprise the voice casting be beyond perfect it simply stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre and sometimes that more than enough

the feeding machine scene be unsurpassed saw this as child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene be so wild that have never laugh so hard at anything again in my entire life literally slide out of my chair to the ground gasp for air the whole film be absurd and brilliant crisply realize by comedy genius but for me that one moment transcend even greatness and touch the sublime where be poetry and god see the feeding machine again as an adult there be tear mixed with laughter to eat be to live it be the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm be so arrogant and pompous that it frighten me lot to see how far it have go as they regulate our speech our food our sex live accord to the late pc doctrine of nice chaplin would not have recognize this new world of ours where the working class he represent here be rule by progressive billionaire spout inanity
good the movue be good and music be also good but be disappoint with the end but the movie be good
be we there yet journey of reawaken in country like ours gore vidal call it the united state of amnesia the absurdity of the behavior in the southern community even the kind one have jar effect viggo mortensen be sheer perfection as the all american italian the opening of his heart and of his mind be total joy and mahershala ali provide another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic character but what make this film fly so high be the humanity that mortensen and ali infuse their character with love them and green book provide me with one of the most satisfying ending of 2018 it leave you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we re not there yet but that we be on our way happy new year
mildly entertaining but nothing more and ultimately boring never be take much with kung fu panda as with lot of reviewer on here dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animation over the year though my favourite be shrek 1 and 2 but the company just isn in the same league as pixar anyway kung fu panda find mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying don get me wrong chuckle at few part throughout and jack black put in an incredible effort of bring lot of charm to po the cast be great include black with dustin hoffman shifu angelina jolie tigress jackie chan monkey seth rogen mantis and lucy lui viper they all lend good voice over to the character and even the story be ok but couldn connect with many of the character the fight sequence if you can call them that be choreograph surprisingly badly the script wasn sharp enough with the comedy as the joke weren all that funny and the animation wasn as impressive as previous animation despite that though it not the bad animation ve see and it be at least try to entertain you and the bottom line be kid will absolutely love it anyway but it not movie would care to watch again
more of an exercise than an experience hate to be the resident party pooper but be leave feel cold by the end for me the gimmick wear off and be leave with bunch of really sad life particularly the lead the entire relationship leave me puzzle don know about you dear reader but when they first meet and he look 70 something and she about 7 just sort of felt that be awkward and not right there be some nice humor sprinkle all throughout particularly from the aged resident of that house and with the early scene that introduce us to benjamin but as the relationship between benjamin and daisy transforms in the second half it be hard to accept this big block of hollywood cheese their scene as they begin to get closer in age start to feel strain to me there be scene where benjamin visit daisy in new york and it just stilted and force really want to care more about this film but feel like it be more an interesting exercise than real experience that leave us with something for me 6 be where movie go that like in some way but that be near miss and all the thick laying on of melodrama and bittersweetness finally just do the picture in
powerful and stirring must see educational material to promote awareness about the true origin of latino community in us it be incredibly important that the new generation watch this documentary as it be inspirational and informative my personal reaction be of immense emotion from the beginning till the end could relate and fully understand the pain of the latino immigrant even though come from eastern europe hopefully enough progressive mind educator expose the truth about the so called immigration problem and fully utilize juan gonzales book to further build lesson and course on how and why the most dangerous enemy be not each other but the great wall of ignorance between us thank you wendy thompson and eduardo lopez for your courage and strength to produce this film despite all obstacle
i be logophobic the good fella at webster dictionary define logophobia as the fear of word may just be logophobic for no word combination scar me more than when at the beginning of film credit contain the word produce write and direct by and be follow by single individual name think about it there be carpenter electrician and plumber but so few jack of all trade even the most seasoned of director like speilberg and scorsese rarely take such control of their film but there be all nestle in my theatre seat popcorn in hand and about to watch the order when hurl at me like nolan ryan fastball be the word produce write and direct by brian helgeland whoa be film buff knew of brian helgeland as writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 year would be graph like dotcom company stock price in 1998 there be as many theatrical unpleasantries assassins the postman conspiracy theory as there be critical and award winning successes a confidential mystic river they seem to alternate one good one bad so know that his last film bloodwork be one of the most wasted effort in clint eastwood career take breath and hop for the best in retrospect should not have exhale the order star heath ledger helgeland a knight tale as alex bernier priest in an order know as the carolingian who be summon to rome when fellow priest be kill under circumstance that the arch bishop deem curious meet up with father thomas also of the order and play wonderfully by still standing mark addy they set out to piece together the riddle leave behind in the wake of the priest untimely death complicate matter be sub plot involve mara sinclair play by shannyn sossamon who have escape from an institution that be the result of her attempt to kill alex during an exorcism alex have feeling towards mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience they travel to rome together nary good night sleep go by and alex be confront by william eden benno fürmann who claim to be century old sin eater sin eater as we be tell be those that eat the sin of die individual when the church do not thus allow entrance into heaven william as luck would have it be tire of life of heal and look for alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duty alex be reluctant but after the death of his new love mara alex resort to the ritual of the sin eater to save her and the transformation be complete alex then search for answer to his many query while father thomas unveil the vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator the order be not terrible film but it be terribly bore there be ridiculous special effect and no connection with any of the character even in the most dramatic scene that of alex walk in on the die mara be pale and bland and leave us with no emotional response towards the couple plight everybody seem to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat line and smell salt could have be administer to keep me from try to grab quick nap in the middle of the film so mr helgeland plead with you not to try this again share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in direction that be not so narrow mind and self serve until then there be nothing emanate that show you be capable of anything more than fail grade two star
overrate movie not that the actor be bad but it turn out that the film be make to make you cry exaggerate the scene be surprise that they didn kill nemo sheep
austen on speed just like the 1940 version this one seem like it on speed there rarely time for breath grant they ve take complex novel and condense it into 2 plus hour but every bit of dialog seem rush there little time for anyone to respond much less react what really mind most be the choice of leave everyone but elizabeth bennet keira knightley out of the story we see nothing of her sister jane little of her interest in bingley none of the caustic wit of bingley sister none of wickham dalliance none of lydia stupidity in fact saw so little of darcy that wonder at any attraction some of the change from the novel be disturb why be charlotte lucas an old maid instead of someone who simply wasn romantic what with all the chicken in the bennet front lawn for this to work the viewer must understand that there be incredible prejudice on everyone behalf not just darcy that lady catherine be just as embarrassing as mrs bennet but unfortunately there doesn seem to have be enough time for any of this shame really because there be moment to be enjoy
great hope great disappointment the imagination be rich but the plot be too thin it kind of fascinating at first but the second half be naive feel that the director and the screenwriter want to create work as good as sen to chihiro no kamikakushi but they be not good enough the film become mediocre and naive
overrate mental disorder eye candy have friend that own video rental store who be huge fan of the graphic novel when heard watchman be be make into movie he be ecstatic so have high hope this would be good but first time saw the trailer think huh that pretty odd superheroes that look like power ranger think this be for adult hop the trailer weren do it justice after few more come out that look well start think this might actually be good movie sadly that be not the case the preview before the movie be the highlight of the 3 hour and 30 minute spend in the theater the whole movie drag on after the first scene where an old hero be murder rorschach be the only likable character and the best part of the whole movie his fight scene be the most intense his attitude actually fit the world of watchman the rest of the character have no redeem quality nothing to attach any real emotion to one be geeky rich kid whose only apparent purpose in the film be to create unrealistic gadget and be part of an unnecessary force love scene another be an average look woman with zero emotional depth wear an extremely poor look costume and whose sole purpose be to strip so the guy watch have something to drool over like nude sex scene don get me wrong but this one be obviously just for show it have no passion at all these two character big fight scene happen in jail house the choreography and style be reminiscent of power ranger their stance how they jump the way they fly in the air none of their punch or kick look to have any power behind them but anything they hit go fly insanely away keep wait for them to call their zords the only redeeming quality of the scene be not use shaky cam as so many movie use for fight scene these day the last character worth mention be the blue man the explanation of his power be he get trap in vaulted door machine that send bolt of electricity at him but what the machine purpose be be pretty much disregard as he get trap group of people just stand and watch guess they never heard of an emergency shutdown the character special effect be great but his explanation be lack any depth he end up with near god like power the ability to teleport himself and others to see his past and future telekinesis in the extreme and genius intellect after his change he begin disassociate himself with humanity although the exact reason for this be shady at best but he keep girl friend until he cheat on her guess even god who be above humanity still get horny maybe he greek he even attempt to develop technology that will stop global nuclear war but again they portray him as uncaring and beyond humanity the entire movie it be like yo yo care no don yes do no don as though the writer have split personality each take control at different moment and want different story it didn make sense the highlight of his disassociation be when he be make to believe he be cause all the people around him to get cancer and die yet the time line it happen in doesn make sense so he freak out and go to of all place mar because he doesn care yet it upset him while there he wave his hand and magically create pointless eye candy clock like thing which serve no purpose but to look cool another pointless aspect of him which be do solely to look cool be the way he go around blow people up pop them like balloon full of blood as apposed to teleport their gun away or knock them unconscious even remove limb would make more sense and be more logical otherwise he just walk around nude the whole movie there be no real explanation as to how any other character come by their power there be however long unneeded sequence at the beginning of the movie that show previous bunch of superheroes who be almost identical to the current bunch these hero act like bunch of degenerate rap and beat each other as though the entire bunch have bipolar disorder one of the so call hero even go so far as to try and seduce his own daughter in way it as though the movie be an allegory as to what if the people who run hollywood be superheroes the end make no sense what so ever the hero allow million to die because they be too crappy at be hero to save the world and the whole idea be that an american which the whole world be afraid of and be why they be about to go to war then blow up half the earth but this be what cause all the other nation to decide to disarm their nuke be ridiculous its like say well the s bomb the entire world and themselves so we be go to just forget about the supposed nuclear war we be just about to have cause this be different since it be do by u citizen that we be all suppose to be afraid of because the s might have him use his power against the world but now that he do we aren go to retaliate like the whole premise of the movie be in the first place wtf do we lose track of our own convolute plot could go on for day about how bad the rest of this movie be and all the problem it have it be no where near as epic as the preview pretend and fan of the graphic novel claim unless the film butcher the source material in which case feel sorry for fan of the novel the idea of anti superheroes with adult theme may have be great but the story be ridiculous and lack logic if you must see it save your money and wait to rent it at least then you can fast forward through all the needless dialog and shoddy explanation of nothing if you be into eye candy pointless passionless love scene poor dialog convolute plot and zero explanation you will love this film

force one to root for the snake except for jon voight character didn find any of the actor character in this film likable just annoy voight be hardly role model either wind up root for the anaconda ice cube jonathan hyde jennifer lopez all play people with chip on their shoulder sorry but rapper with attitude or snobby englishman aren entertain to me in here too be the all too familiar cheap shot against christian in which they show the bad most despicable person in the story and then zoom in several time to show you the cross that sleazebag be wear they always want to make that association and they make it obvious every time what make the movie tolerable at all be the great brazlian swamp scenery and good special effect with the giant snake yeah sometimes the snake scene look bit computer generate but more than not they be just plain scary few of them be downright jaw drop as when it fly through the air swallow human being or swim while on fire this be nice on dvd with rich visuals and very good surround sound if only the people in the movie be half as good as the scenery
not so bad read and heard lot of negative thing about this movie before go in while be not say it be great movie it be definitely fun popcorn movie the character dialog and story be bite over the top but this be comic book movie if you go in expect more than comic book movie you will likely be disappoint so the story be that elektra turn into an assassin after get kick out of good guy martial art school she end up return to the good side and help out young girl and the girl father the bad guy be the hand they send assassin and then they send goon squad with super power my main complaint be get to be my standard complaint with action movie that the action be often not visible shaky cam too tight zoom and quick edits disguise the action also would have love large role cary hiroyuki tagawa who be one of my favorite bad guy of all time
blech have never understand the popularity of this movie terrible act stupid storyline unlikable character and no it not generational thing because m the same age as jennifer grey it just ridiculous movie plain and simple that all
a perfect 10 and here why can not recall piece of work like this in my 40 year of film view there be absolutely nothing be sell to you here it be what it be and it leave almost entirely up to you to make what you will of it hence the 10 10 there no way can critique or score this on any metric d normally use as they re simply not relevant this film critique and score you not the other way around kubrick well indeed that guy movie be riddle with cold unemotional matter of factness that leave them embed in your mind for decade afterwards but this be on another level entirely be set in wintery scotland didn happen by chance it match the film tone perfectly and if you can it worth try to watch it in cold environment that the level of immersion on offer here but only if you can handle it few will how on earth this film ever get make don know there no way in hell it would ever get green light in hollywood so you have to give it up to all concern as it an absolutely stunning achievement scarlett johansson put in pitch perfect performance and for one be glad to see some female nudity portray by someone who look like she eat proper meal recently all the more reason to give her credit in my opinion in an industry obsess with horrific stick thin woman that wasn lose on me and think it be very brave of her to do what she do here don like it when actress do makeup and perfume advert as feel it diminish their credibility as artist and promote them as just another paint wh re and be disappoint to see scarlett in one of those but she more than claw back the respect with this effort if you like only god forgives then try this for size but be warn it make that wonderful film feel like an eddie murphy effort
cosmopolis late evening kviff view complete full house but the film doesn live up to david cronenberg esteem which come across as big blow since have watch all his film since naked lunch 1991 with the exception of dangerous method 2011 and this late nihilistic post modern parable have be his bad so far self indulgent endeavor with deadly hollow format the film actually be one day journey of young tycoon an asset manager to be specific whose routine basically include converse different character in his stretch limo include daily health check meanwhile he be desperately in need of haircut and eventually he end up with man who intend to assassinate him inside sombre building leaf me bewilder and vex not only the storyline never quite form any plausibility in solidify the grandiose milieu the episodic conversation be detach from any possible connection from its first perplexing then dismay audience robert pattinson have exert himself determinedly to enforce his dominance in almost every scene but to no avail most of the time it seem that himself be not convince by the word utter out of his mouth so be the star stud support cast each one occupy his or her own paragraph which doesn worth their faculty although samantha morton and paul giamatti be among the most impressive pick to enact theatrical analogue performance unfortunately the overall resonance be way too absurd and condescend to be take into any in depth consideration the screening receive the most boos and early leaf during my kviff sojourn it certainly can neither do robert pattinson good turn out of his vampire pale complexion nor render mr cronenberg his belated apogee in his grotesque career trek also doubt how the north american market will response to this one dangerous method hardly make end meet hope it will not be major setback to both mr pattinson and mr cronenberg
i hope lilo kick chihiro butt call me old fashion but little thing like plot and structure still mean something to me when m watch movie perhaps these minor little detail simply get lose in the translation perhaps they be spirit away yuk yuk yuk if so then commend albeit with heap of skepticism everyone who praise this movie for their cultural aptitude if not then shame on you for promote this hapless drivel yes the animation be breath take but be the only one who didn want to shoot cute little chihiro and everything else after the first five minute come on people who with me be the only one who wonder why haku the boy dragon dog river whatever be almost kill by that flock of what look like rabid confetti and what be up with the bath ticket and the giant monster baby should have get high before see this movie don know something tell me that it would have make the experience bad lilo and stitch all the way baby
most overrated movie ve ever see interesting movie explore contrast between fame celebrity prestige and artistic integrity it do have some good scene but the character be so pretentious and ego centric that they be not sympathetic the scene where michael keaton lock himself outside the theater and have to run gauntlet of fan musician and doorman to get back inside the theater in time to do his line that be the highlight of the movie for me this be about midway through the film still have high expectation for some kind of big moment of self realization or high drama by the end of the movie sadly the movie do not improve but become increasingly nonsensical to the point of be dishonest and manipulative towards the audience ve see similar movie that explore the creative process that be much good than this one the big picture 1989 and live in oblivion 1995 in way this movie remind me of my dinner with andre critically successful movie that can only be well understand by theater art major with knowledge of obscure work that most people have never hear of we all have to pretend to like it because we be tell by the critic how great the movie be
really really really bad can believe all the good review just saw this dreadful movie mind you m movie buff and love all type of movie this be not only bad would say it be one of the bad movie have ever see and for scarlett johannsen fan she look so ugly so fat so insipid that it must hint at the fact that her career isn go where it should be can believe she would appear in such piece of trash sorry this be so bad that don know where to start saw her on broadway few season ago in cat on hot tin roof and she be sensational be really surprised because ve never really cared for her yes she have sexy lip but her voice be so flat and one dimensional that d never understand all the uproar about her supposed incredible talent in don jon she be suppose to be shrill witch and she do the part very well so thought yes the woman can act but now this just don understand she must command very high salary and must be able to pick and choose her assignment so why would she waste her talent on this and especially look so hideous with that ugly black wig and as state before with belly and love handle that perhaps the director want her to have terrible move ludicrous premise horrible act horrendous filmography mamma mia non capisco niente
just awful the only reason rent this be cuz my wife express interest in see it really have no desire but watch it anyway what waste of 2 hour plus usually don comment on movie here but this be without doubt the bad movie ve see all year and watch several bruce campbell film the acting be horrible and the story be just stupid there be far too many problem to address all of them the end be totally cheesy wow whole nation be gon na put on mask and stand against the evil empire corny and cheesy even the action wasn that great saw it the first time the brother do it in the matrix movie please tell em there wont be sequel ugh just awful and 8 3 average so long as it have big explosion at the end that warrant high rating guess so the movie view public be obviously devoid of any ability to adequately criticize movie
an entertaining bore draw zidane un portrait du 21e siècle offer an unusual and surprisingly thoughtful experience provide sense of the frustration and isolation of legendarily talented footballer but little more the film begin with silent first 15 minute observe zidane skill and movement it feel rather like you re watch the skysports player cam and as such be little disappointing couple with the initial jumping back to the perspective of viewer watching at home then return back to the high quality camera pov it leave you somewhat restless as the director try to create hyperbole of space and reality however you soon become aware of the human ambiance zidane heavy breathing foot drag on the grass like stag before battle the visceral crunch of hefty challenge all create very tangible texture in moment after the referee wrongly give away penalty which the opposition score zidane approach and speak the word you should be ashamed zidane tone and presence make this emphatic condemnation almost papal there be time in this film when one find them self check the time remain on the dvd player whilst be able to appreciate zidane awesome touch and effortless ability the footage be repetitive and too enclose to really gather true sense of zidane perspective those audience who make it past the 15 minute mark be reward when mogwai splendid soundtrack kick in and be compliment by zidane subtitle monologue here you really appreciate the fact that they didn choose an english footballer as their subject the delicate manner in which french translates provide poetic and cinematic syntax we english be very wasteful with our word and m sure if we be hear david beckham thought we would be more spurious at the lack of numerous mention of obviously you know and fantastic at half time the film installs context to the game display both violently move image together with trivial incident apparently go on elsewhere in the world whilst the game take place the intriguing suggestion be that the match tie with fate be pointless and memorable like all thing in truth after this point the film have complete it goal and as such drag to the finish the camera work seem dizzying and whilst the intention be to make the viewer feel zidane experience it ultimately fail whilst we empathise with his irritation and patience we be not reward like he be with the thrill of be on the pitch there be an absence of space and vision which would truly mimic his sensation zidane exit be practically welcome when he be send off ten minute before the match finish but he leave with poetic sense of irony after game of fisticuffs his hot head land him in trouble like it do at world cup 2006 we be leave with an emotive sense of futility his send off metaphor for mortality leave the pitch to hero applause think the film could have benefit from more subtitled speech from zidane and with the extension of the soundtrack last from start to finish but what hamper this film be it lack of create the true experience of space and vision in football game in truth the attempt to re create zidane frustration at not receive the ball on time and have his pass clumsily lose be overwhelm by our frustration at the sense of claustrophobia and detachment
a classic that leave cinematic and intellectual wound on religious poignance zakhm 1998 brief review classic that leave cinematic and intellectual wound on religious poignance have watch almost all top rat film of ajay devgn and this have to be the most impactful and powerful classic of him can say the same for mahesh bhatt as be yet to see some of his known classic but zakhm should stand in top 3 for sure bhatt make the film after 5 year from riot event and he be busy make commercial film by copy from other industry then he decide to write this fresh script and deliver one of the fine product of his career zakhm be not story of one hero or heroin it be story of one peculiar family and somehow of our society to some extend religious identity of woman didn let her live married life she dream but her death become wound for her childrens and create some difference due to political propaganda helm by some opportunist don see any mistake in the writing it a top class piece of solid writting wood there be conflict that will force you to think there be some scene which tell lot about religious issue and how the hatred be not good for human and at last the love angle too be fantastically drive watch out for the scene when sonali bendra realise the meaning of true love and the scene when ajay devgn reveals about her mother religious identity mahesh bhatt have make one complete package of so many thing and wonder how accurately with zakhm ajay devgn set standard of act not only for himself but also for other bollywood actor he deserve the national award but feel he should have have more scene and more space but he be stop by the writing which include important portion from his childhood pooja bhatt shine equally she do great job consider the kind of unconventional role she play nagarjuna sonali bendra be good enough with their cameo role support cast have do nice job and kunal khemu akshay anand saurabh shukla avtar gill ashutosh rana definitely deserve mention musically there be ups and down gali me aaj chaand nikla be the only memorable stuff but others song be situationally effective zakhm have get some unforgettable and hard hitting dialogue maa aur desh badla nahi karte maa ki koi jaat nahi hoti these 2 can never fade away from my memory mahesh bhatt direct the film without add any masala or useless stuff and this be something which will be remember for year not only for the great script but also for his brilliant direction honestly feel that there should have be more intellectual portion in the end which be miss and that final scene of pooja bhatt and nagarjuna in heaven be totally unnecessary because it clearly indicate that director focus be still there at love story when the film have go through some terrific religious tension by that moment one more little scene on social message there and zakhm would have be masterpiece for now classic be not less though must see rating 8 10 by samthebestest
another blumhouse cash grab know it silly to expect any kind of realism in movie about an invisible man but every movie at least have to make sense within its own universe this movie have so many plot hole and logical inconsistency which be horribly distract so the boyfriend pretend to have commit suicide something which his brother and executor of his will prove to elizabeth moss with photograph where the boyfriend be clearly recognizable his face isn mangle or anything he have just cut his wrist so who pronounce him dead and how do the brother show up to the police and the coroner with photo of his brother and go hey here my dead brother let get start with the execution of his will what do you mean evidence just trust me bro apparently the boyfriend be some optic wiz work with refractive projection and multiple camera something which be explain in six second insert of an article about his suicide nice backstory bro actually there be zero backstory in this movie we have no idea what the relationship between moss and her boyfriend be like guess we just have to take her word for it there be zero character development the boyfriend be just crazy apparently can really call him character at all he just plot function why do the boyfriend build this suit at all be it only to stalk moss in case she ever break up with him and why be his brother in on his scheme and thought for quite while that her sister and the black cop be date but apparently not what be his relationship to moss that he allow her to move in with him and his teenage daughter just friends the way the suit work be inconsistent when the invisible man hold gun the entire gun be visible but the cell phone he use to take photo of moss sleeping be nowhere to be see guess he waddle out of the room like duck after stuff it someplace safe where the sun don shine and if the suit be build with camera and projection why isn the ground or carpet under his foot completely dark what about the inside of his thigh and his armpit where the camera be just film one another would it be visible or video feedback loop and how be the suit fool more than one spectator at time view it from different angle m get die another day flashbacks if the movie be engage these be probably not question even would have though of but here we be but say we buy all this the main problem be that as horror movie it isn particularly scary there be no real sense of dread m not talk about jump scare those be startle and cheap not scary and m certainly not talk about gore either and it far too long this movie have no business be long than 100 minute the kevin bacon version have two thing work in its favor first of all there be motivation for the invisibility and why he go insane secondly it set in limited and seclude location where the character be trap for the most part in the 2020 version moss be roam all over the place all she need be an uber
a masterpiece of video art design music and dance after an intensely screened screen feature nervous suit deliver in limousine and gentle but firm gentleman control the ticket flow to assure certain target group would be test for their age predilection and proclivity and wand wield security guard frisk patron for any sign of record device include cellphone enter what we be tell be the first ever in the world test market screening of the taymor beatles extravaganza across the universe thought of peter frampton in sergeant pepper haunt me but my admiration of taymor and well be actually kid in the audience of the sullivan show on february 9 1964 be even in band that appear on mtv in their first hour robin lane the chartbusters iattended my share of protest work with reverend daniel berrigan get psychedelic and well enough about my qualification to review the movie it seem still don fit the intended demographic it the first time ever lie my age downward so despite that the studio may change some thing here what saw at this stage of tweak the film without quibble over loose plot point and misguided scene as they seem to be still tinker with those thing and there be there be several out of place and unexplained scene ve rarely see such feverish work of persistent video art in the service of great music these be not small music video wrap around questionable plot taymor vision as director seem to borrow from everything her story ideally want to conjure up the not just the frolic but the frenzy and passion of the 60 there be what look like jan svankmajer in stun industrial dance scene in draft board as civilian be turn into soldier another scene have giant puppet pageantry straight out of peter schumman bread and puppet theater and resurrection circus there be joyous location street dance scene and breathtaking technicolor composites one such scene be dreamlike vision do entirely in the psychedelic solarise color of richard avedon beatle portraits her set design be at time so clever and colorful you laugh at the unrestrained joy and dare she begin with glorious reinvention of the fifty musical and careen into pure psychedelic delirium the cinematography be rich and vary to the purpose of each scene and dance sequence explode into place the film move from the innocence of small town upper middle class america to the nascent hippy scene in the village to sort of hallucinatory garden of eden with too much but amuse bono as ken kesey merry prankster guru type it move to romance and onto the danger and volatility of the anti war 60 all this be render through constant flow beatles song deliver amidst magnificent set design and video composite for the most part the music be respectfully and tastefully rearrange and without the pavlovian shamelessness of the beatles as they be use in be sam ballad version of want to hold your hand movingly reinvent the song don know if the actor actually sing but you could have fool me it be all carefully synched up even the drummer and strummers be always in synch the actor be charm but once again as she have do in dig to china to down in the valley evan rachael wood rivet the film it would too much to believe she could also sing like the angel but darn if her throat isn in sych the voice be beautiful at time song and sound collide like the beatles in number nine the collision of war protest at columbia university with helter skelter over dear prudence be brilliant taymor have edginess that match the sixty zeitgeist and avoid the vacuous cotton candy fluff of luhrmann moulin rouge think it would be wise to address taymor strength which be the darker political vision the film intented audience ought to be as angry as they be in the 60s marching in the street and stand up to an arrogant and corrupt administration with their trillion dollar war the parallel to today be obvious the time be right for such film with such politics it shouldn get comprise by too much gooey and gratuitous romance overheard two young girl afterward say don know why they have to redo those great song whereas much old couple be say this be great very artistic fun it really catch the feeling of the era hope the handler in their infinite wisdom don sell out the ability of this film to be politically relevant as well as beautiful character and situation that obviously echo janis joplin and jimi hendrix the weatherman the weather underground abbie hoffmann ken kesey draft card burn 60 club in the east village café wha become café huh and other sly reference be fun to pick out though assume detail be undergoing revision for clarity don think this be just film for 20 somethings the kid sit with remark this be important stuff for our generation to remember taymor darker sensibility be what the film really need to keep it from be perceive as so much razzle dazzle and romance there a subversive edge to this story visually it be unquestionably masterpiece of video art its final judgment may be that it can speak across generation
give this film chance it be well do for american audience after watch the original first then this film would recommend it to anyone especially if you haven see the original thought spike lee do good job of keep the original essence of the film and make tweak to appeal to american audience think the acting and fight scene be well do why not give this movie chance don let the purist ruin it for you it a well do film base on great original idea if you have see the original girl with the dragon tattoo then watch the remake would liken it to that in the aspect of keep it quite similar but make the appropriate tweak
one of the ten bad movie ever can only imagine that those who like this film find appeal in the violence it certainly isn 39 in the direction or story tell it 39 an incredibly badly write and episodic piece full of irrelevant scene without which it would only be an hour long what be relevant make no use of the medium character be not introduce through telling action but by introduce themselves in some kind of criminal job interview tarantino 39 39 genius 39 seem to be habit of have the low sort of people engage in violent pursuit converse as casually as lady at tea it 39 a trick he use and re us in all his film maybe reservoir dog be mean to have deconstructionist element la from dusk till dawn but think it 39 just what it appear to be really bad film br br william bell
i wish read some review before watch this be complete illogical mess from begin to end be so mad to have waste almost two hour of my life over this most of the scene and dialogue be so cringeworthy this rival redline as one of the bad movie ve ever see and ever make netflix need to do good with their movie most of the show be great but it like they don even bother with some movie
decent entertain enough not bore this be short charming and nonsensical movie which really enjoy there be lot of good laugh scene and the plot keep move at fast enough pace there be some cute quirk in the story line itself that make the movie and character even more enjoyable despite the rest of the plot be fairly predictable michael caton who play the mad animal doctor be absolutely hilarious rob schneider do really good portrayal of marvin the goofy wannabe police officer whose life be save by get rebuilt with animal part after big accident he definitely funny actor who pull off this type of roll well and with impeccable time marvin love interest play by colleen haskell deliver her line ok enough but the chemistry didn really seem to be there between the two the rianna character definitely have the potential to be one of the more interesting character but most scene with her in it have marvin steal or save the scene all in all this be really fun comedy and delivers laughable view experience of course it completely unbelievable at time but that just add to the amusement if you let it don expect it to make sense just sit back be entertain and get ready to laugh
an enjoyable film that you may or may not find annoying and unnecessary m not go to bother recount the plot direction of the matrix reload there be two reason for this first it up there in the plot section and second it actually not relevant to whether or not you like or will like this film allow me to explain watch on its own merit reload isn terrible dare say it quite good it even have little glimmer of genuine brilliance the extraordinary backlash against it be less because of its actual content and more because of its existence at all the matrix be such standalone unit in everybody mind that any sequel could only have felt like clunky shift from single film to serialisation test my own intuition on this by ask myself what would have constitute good non disappoint sequel to the matrix and realise that nothing would have meet the mark we be always go to feel that one of our modern classic have be violate to some degree there much that good about reload not least the exposition and development of the inner working of the matrix and ai smith character get work over and becomes if possible even more interesting the unsettling discrepancy between him and the other agent and his relentless unfathomable even to him desire for freedom from his own system and nature be pick up from the first film and flesh out so to speak there a much broad cast and much of the support acting be excellent anthony zerbe as the head councillor in zion stand out for me his small quiet scene escape my notice entirely at first because first time round be impatient to see more relevant thing happen but on repeat viewing they re welcome change of pace however there be teethe problem tank marcus chong everybody favourite operator in the matrix and generally fantastic character have no appearance his replacement be link play by harold perinneau who d previously encounter playing michael in lost he annoy me more in this film than in that series because whereas lose shoehorn him into the angry black man stereotype for long time before give him some real characterisation reload seem content to ignore his ability as an actor entirely and use him primarily for comic relief during tenser moment someone narrowly escape death back in his control room link squeal with relief that sort of thing it a matter of personal taste but could have handle him be more serious character can only talk about act for so long before mention keanu reef and it that time again keanu be all over this film he ramp it up here with love scene meditative dialogue in which the aforementioned anthony zerbe among others sort of draws attention to keanu by out act him considerably and small handful of one liner if you have serious keanu allergy you simply win be able to enjoy this film whereas in the matrix his stiff quiet style be in character for the stiff confuse pre enlightenment neo reload have him take centre place as the hero of the film and if you can stand watch him act then it probably not worth your time personally he start to grow on me mention love scene romance play big part in this film which for my money be bad thing because it never really be the wachowski brother forté the first film have kind of weird relationship with relationship with neo and trinity ostensibly fall in love after few week of tense brief exchange in car and between gunfight reload continue their bizarre silent courtship the subplot of their relationship be central to the story so it pop up again and again but it never seem to bring the film well moment wherever love be concern the script seem to take break and most of the romantic dialogue feel clunky and force you may experience it differently but just so you re forewarn you will hear keanu reef utter the phrase love you too damn much on happy note there be ton of new antagonist all of whom be extremely fun to watch morpheus take close to centre role again get lot of the screen time and do awesome thing with it and though it probably doesn need mention the action sequence be joy to watch car be crashed lorry explode bullet fly door melt in slow motion and it generally action fodder of the high calibre the sound effect team go little overboard with every slight movement of sword be punctuate by shhiinng and that bassy bullet time noise fill roughly half the film the rest be fill by over the top orchestral climax but it not experience break ultimately though these be secondary concern your ability to enjoy this film will hinge on whether or not you feel the matrix need sequel the comment hear most often about reload be that it just didn need to happen if that how you feel about it you ll probably find reloaded annoying and disappointing at least at first despite the fact that it really quite good if that be your experience at the cinema and you haven watch it since though give it another chance
sign of thing to come the final installation in the original star war trilogy and culmination of an epic story about galaxy in peril about the battle between two ancient faction about the battle between good and evil control and passion personally think it a significant step backwards from the previous two movie the story doesn flow as smoothly the end climax isn as exciting as the two previous one we have to blow the death star again the character be not as good as they use to be and the new stuff which there be still lot of to the film credit be not as good as in the previous one in this film we see for the first time the sign and phenomenon that would come to haunt us in the prequel trilogy to go over few of the highlight we have the ewoks now apparently they be suppose to be wookies which would have be amaze chewbacca be fan favourite and we would have get to see his people his culture more laser crossbows all that good stuff instead we have the elite troop of the galactic empire be beat back by an army of teddy bear m not the only one see the problem here right plus the character luke han and vader be still very good and especially vader have some his best moment in this film especially near the end but leia for example have be relocate to complete support role to the point that she really have no point in be in this film she a far cry from the nail hard snarky blaster tot space princess she be in the first film not quite on the padmé level of chickification but head in the same direction ian mcdiarmid also have his screen debut as the emperor in this film and while he be amazing and will pretty much carry the prequel film alone with his charisma here his over the topness be bit unsettling because you re already wary and look for flaw because of the ewoks then again the effect be still amaze the battle scene be excite the final confrontation with luke vader and the emperor be one of cinema fine for reason the space battle of endor be good one and the story be by no mean bad one it just isn as good as the two previous one which be two of the best adventure stories ever put on film so go ahead and see the film if you ve like the trilogy so far it not as good if you ask me but it still fit conclusion to the saga
best movie of 2007 be look forward to this film when the first time heard about it because m huge simpson fan and now it be great to have movie after about 18 year of tv series that entire wait be worth it the film be soooooooooo funny that have sore stomach there wasn a single scene be didn laugh and everyone in the cinema hall be laugh there head off the simpson movie be make so well and have an interesting story tell in stylish format m not surprise that it already on the top imdb top 250 hope it always stay there ve see lot of film of 2007 but the simpson movie be simply the best so far and don think there will be good film in the year it start off really good with the itchy scratchy show then all of sudden homer say boring in the theatre then he say what the point waste money it on tv for free don know which the best scene be because love every second my verdict be 20 10 because it be well than expect and it truly an unforgettable film when leave the cinema hall be constantly think about it on my way home when arrive be talk to my family all day about it and the movie make my day definitely the kind of film that can be watch again again want to get it on dvd the first day it come out
good than expect be big fan of the hit man game be fairly worry when heard that they be go to make movie base on it because movie base on video game don tend to be very good movie but after see it last night must say be pleasantly surprised it be actually quite good movie it may not win an oscar or anything but it amaze to see agent 47 up on the big screen timothy olyphant do surprisingly good job of portray him too the love interest be bit awkward to anyone who know agent 47 nearly complete lack of emotion in that department but despite what the trailer may lead you to expect it really doesn go very far outside of what you ve come to know in the game and what happen when she try to seduce him be absolutely hilarious and very much in the agent 47 tradition it be indeed violent movie and 47 be as cold blood as you expect him to be see it tend to make me wish other movie hero have the same level of gut just to shoot the bad guy in the face instead of let him live or anything silly like that the fight scene with the other assassin from the agency be also very well do and quite treat to see all in all it quite good movie definitely worth pay to see in the theater hopefully there ll be another one
yes m talk about tv review await further instruction there be device which sit in the corner of our lounge kitchen bedroom and possibly even in our car which many people say destroy our interaction with each other because when this device be in use all we do be stare at it or even just have this device on for the background sound the way people may sit for hour on end staring at this device and believe everything it tell them it as if it be worship yes m talk about tv this film be to be see to be believe absolutely love this film from the slow start and building the tension up until valuable lesson learn this be in my personal opinion an absolute gem and if memory serf me correctly be loosely base on an episode from fox mystery theatre season 1 episode 13 child play neuclear war so if you be look for genuinely scary film because it be all too real then this be one for you rating 9 out of 10
great superhero movie in history saw the preview at the end of thor back in 2011 have to wait almost year to experience the global phenomenon first hand the theater experience wasn something to forget all in all the title of this review say it all marvel the avenger be quite possibly the great superhero movie in history the combination of hardcore assassin widow and hawkeye reclusive banner arrogant iron man leader cap and the norse brother thor and loki mix itself together into concoction of personality and superpower which guarantee to impress marvel have set the bar high for themselves since its release only select few superhero movie have compare to it and all of them have be marvel

i like it well this be fun it like cross between an 80s sex comedy and those disney movie from the 70s where kurt russell gain super strength or intelligence from science experiment go wrong it feel like it might be parody of those movie be you junkie son although keep see people say it a take on carrie assume that because of the climax which be clearly spoof carrie little the movie team scott baio and willie aames year before their charles in charge glory baio play nerd who gain the power of telekinesis from lab accident aames be his horny friend who doesn hesitate to exploit this new power as much as he can baio be enjoyable and aames be lot of fun even though his character be kind of scummy at time the support cast be terrific with old actor like sue ane langdon scatman crothers robert mandan and the great lawanda page provide many of the movie laugh highlight include the star trek scene marijuana einstein dream the cheesy montage when baio get lay and the baseball game where scatman crothers make fat kid eat booger all this plus sexy heather thomas and some corny sound effect love to death because m simple like that it a fun movie and really wasn expect it to be obviously judging by its score here it not well love by most guess can see why but do like it so would recommend it to anyone thinking of try it out provide you be prepared for it to be somewhat odd mix of corny and vulgar
ok but nothing to e this be fun to watch but where be the sharp wit and irony so prevalent in the novel the father especially be great disappointment his ironic comment from the book be now utter in dull ogre like way this darcy be nothing to colin firth he lack intelligence and gorgeousness that make elizabeth love for him understandable in this he just stand there dumbly for the most part and elizabeth sudden love for him seem base purely on her favorably impression of the magnificent pemberly knightly be dynamic elizabeth and aside from the irritatingly dingy fringe of hair at the nape of her neck she be lovely again though she lack that tireless wit that jennifer ehle display so believably jane be by far the best character in this movie her beauty and little bit of silliness make her endearing and exactly what jane should be
the performance that beat jake gittes lenny bruce and michael corleone pretty schmaltzy road trip movie that star art carney in an oscar win performance as an old man who evict from his apartment and go off on late in life voyage of self discovery carney be win and likable but the film tread too softly and safely for it to be truly engage indeed come across this on tcm and spend the first 40 or so minute wonder if even want to watch the whole thing only decide to once so much time have pass that it seem silly not to if you re interested in it for some of the other actor bill in the cast like ellen burstyn be warn that no one but carney get more than some very short cameo burstyn herself have maybe five minute of screen time see this movie if you want to see the performance that inexplicably beat jack nicholson chinatown dustin hoffman lenny and al pacino the godfather part ii to the oscar otherwise you re not miss all that much grade
pretty bore stuff have no idea why this movie have receive such good rating itxb4s an average prison movie without any highlight typical hollywood stuff there be hundred of good movie around the movie drag the actor be average itxb4s just this typical heartbreaking stuff and far away from other movie up on this list 2
good acting and story try too hard on visuals honestly do enjoy the acting and could tell the cast be serious about their role the story be solid and convince what ruin it for me be the visual effect please note saw this in 3d so it may be good visually in 2d the cgi pop out way too much it be almost as if the effect be layer hovering over the picture this issue be notable in the rocket exhaust storm and breath vapor another problem be the soap opera effect the movie at time look like soap on daytime television actually laugh once during scene where astronaut be suppose to be weightless in space station it look way too fake also there be time that it felt as if scene drag on little long than they should have
a muddled movie that could have be so much more there should be so much to like about this movie and how the director manage to create the incoherent mess it become be mystery it be disjoint and wander the first 20 minute be interest in the mountain etc then snap new location with no apparent connection which immediately disconnect you from the film then it start to build into an interesting urban myth bogeyman movie then snap change its mind to an earth end lovecraftian plot the plot could have make sense if tell with some sort of flow but it become so disjoint by the end really didn care

genuine originality let down by poor execution wyrmwood be aussie take on the popular apocalypse zombie genre it a very down to earth production that incorporate lot of very australian cultural element mateship australian for friendship plain talk love of beer fast customized vehicle and the handyman can do attitude be frequently employ in this film the zombie action be reasonable and the story line do include some genuine originality wyrmwood be however somewhat let down by failed attempt at humour stunt character development and no real direction in term of where the story be suppose to lead us the end result be rather disjointed lifeless film no pun intend that leave you feel it should have deliver more five out of ten from me
a special gift only open spoiler when la la land open with cliché of people sing on the street couldn help but think of bollywood and how can help to cringe bit but la la land make me forget this very fast it very hard to describe you find yourself root for both main actor and their success not only because they be such likeable character but because you re never sure you can predigt whats about to happen when finish la la land want to rewatch it immidiately think ve never have this urge to rewatch movie that fast again many thing speak for this the scenery be unique likeable character engage plot etc the big reason might be how wished this be videogame with different ending it funny because the movie have message for the viewer how freedom and chase for your dream be important it give me this feeling of freedom that think can rewatch it again and change something in the plot so get another end so why do want to change the end in term of send the message mention above the end be perfect very very strong and meaningful one it just that have soft spot for likeable character in movie and want them to have everything in perfect way imaginable
it magical carefully craft and beautifully portray love the movie it go at the right pace each character be carefully choose and help build the story the theme be unusual but worthwhile if you be go through any relationship issue cinematography be attractive and set be wonderful how the situation turn around after the fallen marriage could not have be say in good way the takeaway for me be build the nest the family will come and keep the childhood innocence alive
almost 40 year later this movie lame and bore this movie might ve be interest for 20th century audience but that probably only because the technology and visual effect be all new and thrill back then to those from the 21st century who ve already be expose to much more exciting improve technological effect several time this movie will be waste of time to me besides the fact that the graphic that have be enjoy by perhaps billion in the past be nothing in comparison to the graphic of the average 2010s sci fi movie this movie be horrible because of the fact that it lack reasonably good plot the plot be all over the place at time difficult to follow but mostly just downright bore even if you must watch this film because you re devote star war fan you re probably not enjoy this film lesson learnt movie doesn need to be good just because it at the top of the imdb 250 list if you re interested in sci fi d recommend watch more recent film like 1 interstellar or 2 the matrix or even something animate like 3 wall
not recommended period just come back from the movie it wouldn be enough to say that the movie didn live up to my expectation it wouldn be enough to say that this be by far the bad pixar movie have to say more have to say that there aren many redeemable quality in car 2 but if have to select the major problem of this movie be that pixar have fail to its primary audience this be movie with story extremely difficult to follow and on top of that illogic this be movie with dozen of explosion and shooting this be movie with duration of almost two hour you don need to be genius to figure out that long complex illogic movie full of machine gun be not the best fit for the intended audience leave the theatre think don these guy run focus group how do they come with failure like this just year after produce what regard as the great animated movie of all time they have prove many time that what they know what they do so in the first car which like there be compel story it be about transformation maturity and life perspective it be funny too everything rotate around something profound it make sense in car 2 someone at pixar think that script around mater as an unintended secret agent would be worth of movie but sadly the circumstance be never upgrade to become concept leave the theatre empty car 2 have be big disappointment
my favorite movie ever for over 25 year now have cite blade runner as my favorite movie of all time after see watchman may have to reconsider first m glad go to see the movie alone ve hear so many comment focus on blue dick or the length of the movie or some other such nonsense that m sure watch it with someone would have be constant barrage of commentary and complaint and no that not javier bardem yes the movie be long nearly three hour but unlike the dreadfully insipid titanic at the end of this movie wasn ask for those three hour of my life back and as with all such movie you must be able to look beyond the literal watchman be iconic and iconoclastic deconstructionist and revisionist laden with allegory and allusion consider for example the character ozymandias m wonder how many people who view the film ever even heard of percy bysshe shelley poem by the same name the character even quote the poem on plinth in his antarctic lair the allusion be amaze here the full quote and on the pedestal these word appear my name be ozymandias king of king look on my work ye mighty and despair nothing beside remain round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sand stretch far away clearly one must see the allusion to the work in this case of superhero who hop to leave mankind lasting legacy but realize in the back of his mind that everything be eventually lose in time ozymandias be the first poem ever examine from an expositional point of view and be blow away the use of it in this movie be equally impactful then there be dr manhattan name of course for the manhattan project which yield the atomic bomb his character be an allegory for god and his relationship with man mirror the apparent detachment with which god see suffer in the world he create the deity reference be reinforce often and one think of oppenheimer citation of the bhagavad gita in which vishnu take on godly form and say now be become death the destroyer of world in an expository scene in the second act dr manhattan have sort of recollection of his life his account be dizzyingly elliptical since he do not see time as linear the way others do this scene have the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction alan lightman almost unbearably beautiful einstein dream and the reference to einstein can not be ignore but the real beauty of watchman be the moral diversity of its superheroes each be flaw in different way allow us to inhabit different ethical perspective intellectually at least and witness their consequence everything from rorshach refusal to compromise which make him doomed fugitive to the ultimate compromise envision by ozymandias who can dispassionately evaluate scenario where million of life be sacrificed call into question our most cherish belief where do it leave you well that for you to decide from purely entertainment perspective watchman be stun the visuals be state of the art and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection have for some movie that present too many special effect to swallow at once as reality and watchman doesn suffer from hollywood apparent fascination with camp in comic book movie camp work to some degree in spiderman since he a somewhat humorous character to begin with but the excess of camp render the fantastic four sequel unwatchable watchman prove that superheroes can use more subtle form of humor such as irony without devolve into camp for cheap laugh and the music oh the music if you didn grow up in the 60 and 70 you will surely miss some of the impact but don worry even second hand recollection of such iconic tune will suffice be remind of the painfully awful across the universe which couldn even pull together decent movie build around the great catalog in modern music watchman do it in spade lol i cry the people in the theatre applaud at the end vow to wait 24 hour before write review to see if my euphoria pass it hasn
over rat and overblown perhaps m miss something here but grow rather bore with dog day afternoon find the film to be overblown nonsense and irritate al pacino make far good film during this decade like the first two godfather instalment scarecrow and serpico his character here come across as be buffoonish and totally ineffectual find the setting to be wrong as well the only redeeming quality about dog day afternoon be the cast the fine character actor charles durning be very good as the police officer there be plenty of 1970s american film that overshadow this one
the dark knight confidently direct dark brooding and pack with impressive action sequence and complex story the dark knight include career define turn from heath ledger as well as other oscar worthy performance tdk remain not only the best batman movie but comic book movie ever create

what so great about this have hear all the raf reviewer say you ll want to watch this movie several time because it so complex really want to see it then do my wife give up after less than half of it force myself to see it through because hoped there be something to redeem it well there wasn complex nothing worthwile be reveal after the first half actually the thing be pretty much clear after the first scene never mind the sordid detail reveal later doen add anything for me an uninteresting unbelievable unappealing story act out by character one can not get oneself to care for so it tell backwards big deal ve see similar thing before do much well no short term memory try winter sleeper that idea be use there much well act the character have to look bewildered and smarmy in turn not great range in my opinion my conclusion don bother with this one
more or less underwhelming for vendetta seem like it want to be provocative and although it do somewhat succeed it more or less fall short it certainly timely relevant film bring up issue like medium manipulation censorship national surveillance religious hypocrisy fear monger torture prejudice etc but despite that it be mostly underwhelming to say the least the script write by the wachowskis felt like it be slightly revise first draft the plot be convolute and the dialogue be half assed though for vendetta do boast some striking visuals and imagery the cinematography and lighting be ugly and jarringly bright respectively during the first act natalie portman performance as evey hammond be mostly hard to watch but late in the second act she be give some dramatic flare stephen fry be one of the best thing about this film
up have watch this movie few time and find it interest every time
no redemption the film e bleek no redemption no story arch it be so terrible be yves bet there be moment of pure professional glory but guess be gay be what be most important thing about hike in his personality at least that it be portray his sexual life in our face fashion and milestone 0 5
informative and somehow interesting first of all don be fool by other review this movie be neither crap nor masterpiece it have lot of technical term and jargon from the world of economics and despite the obvious effort to explain thing include break the 4th wall e talk direct to the audience while look into the camera and cameo appearance from movie star like margot robbie and selina gomez you will probably fail to understand in depth the mechanic of what be happen the world of bank fund bond financing and the stock market will remain mystery for most of the viewer big name of hollywood star in the big short include brad pitt ryan gosling christian bale and others they play real person who have an insight on the global economic crisis we probably still experience as movie it have its own style something of documentary comedy sometimes but essentially drama since the crisis cost 8 million people their job and their home people who be impress easily might tell you this be masterpiece believe me it isn but recommend to see it even well at home where you can pause or rewind the movie to understand good it be lengthy 130min but you win get bore it need some patience though especially in the beginning and not to be disappoint when term like cdo payouts etc be start to emerge
the mcdowell version of porky a movie that could only be make in the early 80 it have very usa up all night with rhonda shear vibe to it except with lot more nudity it very much porky redheaded step child as the entire plot be 5 high school guy try to see high school virgin name purity boob mission that no man have yet to accomplish yes that be the plot there a scene where they go strip bowling and the stereotypical typical nerd get his member stick in one of the hole couple girl get him all work up and he shoot the ball down the lane for strike why do give this movie 3 star again
dumb but honest like golden retriever cover in ketchup cameron diaz do what she can with what little she give to work with in james mangold brainless hyperactive and utterly rote spy romance thriller knight and day pair with the increasingly wooden increasingly off put tom cruise as half of pair of mi match adventurer on the run with valuable macguffin fight off arm dealer and cia agent alike she seem to be the only one in the flick that get half inch worth of ambition diaz be ask to play one of those uniquely stupid hollywood committee take on modernize cute woman in peril who learn to handle her own uzis tough talk bostonian who raise her younger sister and be totally girly and cute and goofy and likes boy but wear boot and fix up muscle car cruise plays agent roy miller the agent go rogue who swoop into her life and together they have series of absolutely predictable kung fu fireball escapade across series of scenic european rooftop knight and day attempt to enliven its muddled characterless story by kick thing off with the zenithal version of one of the tired hollywood trope character meet cute and it succeed well enough in its early stage where diaz be allow to stretch her cute chop talk to herself in an airplane bathroom while cruise miller wreaks havoc outside it all downhill from there though as cruise robotically manufacture performance that at best be reminiscent of the cocky aggressive charm he could exude in decade past the film trade in its early attempt at characterization for repeat slapstick gag and hard to follow plot twist all of which it then try to paper over with breathless action and hokey romance to be fair the film doesn shoot very high it wear its low brow goofiness right there on its sleeve and it mostly achieve its goal of be light hearted dumb as rock summer action movie which be more entirely than can be say for say ashton kutchers repellent killer see it in good mood with low expectation and you might be well enough convince that it light rather than stupid fun rather than ridiculous charming and cute rather than manufacture and plastic that last part be probably stretch though
groundhog day with slasher mystery twist saw happy death day as somebody who be fascinate by the concept find the advertising interesting and good enough to warrant view and who appreciate horror when do well see it just before halloween as part of my halloween celebration will admit to not be as bowl over by the film as would have like but enjoy it good deal as surprisingly interest as the advertising be and there have be some dreadful advertising this year notable recent example be the completely mis market geostorm it be also mislead one would expect truly frightening film judge from the trailer but actually happy death day happen to be much more than what be indicate and wasn what one would call terrifying or sleep with the light on for week the good news be that happy death day actually make the most of its concept refresh have see film recently that have concept that they didn do anywhere near enough with the not so good news be that as enjoyable as it be it do feel like something be miss it be easy to see why lot of people will like and have like happy death day it be just as easy to see why it will be and have be let down for others my opinion have shade of both lean towards the former happy death day may be somewhat standard while the concept be pretty unique one some of the story element aren superficial other than the lead character the character be develop very flimsily and some part don make as much sense as they could and feel unfinished be expect more from the killer twist reveal which be not as clever and surprising as one would like and the whole end felt rather silly and rush to me the killer motive also come over as really trivial for an elaborate set up little slow to begin with too it once the concept kick in when happy death day properly come to life and maintain that energy for the rest of the film for all those fault though happy death day be also refreshingly self aware almost very much aware of its standard ness and superficiality and acknowledge it and manage to be lot of fun creepy suspenseful and surprisingly think provoke gruesomely funny sum it up very well happy death day be long way from amateurish visually the photography be stylish rather than slapdash the editing have suitably unnerving moment and the lighting be atmospheric christopher landon never let it get too heavy while not dilute the fun or scare and the at time haunt and at others time funky soundtrack add lot when it come to the script happy death day be full of know humour and never remove its tongue from its cheek instead keep it firmly intact throughout which prove to come off really well it also really make one think the story execution be not perfect but it never dull and have some neat twist and turn that stop it from be predictable and repetitive jessica rothe should become big star after her excellent lead turn here she have be act few year before this but this be the first time where she really hold my attention and allow me to take proper notice of her israel broussard be also very believable and the two have great chemistry together the acting on the whole be solid but essentially it all about rothe and she be one of the main reason why happy death day be worth view overall long way from perfect but quite enjoyable 6 10 bethany cox

start well but quickly become unrealistic well do initially but as the first season progress the drama pile on like twister player completely unbelievable by the end the final straw be when the parent decide to have baby in the midst of it all yes that definitely the way to cope with the recently depart grandparent the co parent with substance abuse issue and the five teen or tweens several of whom have have serious behavioral issue in the past year one of whom be recently adopt and one of whom remain in gray limbo zone of foster childness complicate by her ongoing attraction to her alleged brother to be yep perfect time to have baby
not as powerful as have hop platoon do well to portray the hopeless and wild emotion of us soldier as they face war that seem random pointless and inexplicable think it focus little too much on the random and pointless put low emphasis on the confusing emotion that the soldier probably felt that make me occasionally feel like the movie itself be pointless rather than allow me to sympathize with the men so think the film miss the mark for me
to avoid be take away to nurse home an old widower try to fly his home to paradise fall south america along with boy scout who accidently lift off with him so that what this movie be about and all this time one of my friend tell me it be an old man fly to south america to pay tribute to his deceased wife turn out the movie be about oldie mcfart refuse to stay in probably comfortable nursing home m glad he get trap up in the sky with that boy and that dog give this one star and blame my friend
not quite sure about all the hype don get me wrong it be suspenseful at time insert suspenseful music here and be support by an outstanding cast though it be just very predictable from the start we see that mill be weak rookie detective who make the most simple of mistake even when be plead not to so we know he will be victimize at the conclusion of the film how hard be it for me to take wild guess and say that the press guy attempt to take photo at the scene of the crime be in fact our serial killer john doe not very hard must admit the fact that the director have to bring to our attention that mill wife tracy be pregnant and hide it from mill tell us that something gruesome be go to happen to her or the baby in the end and all it do be create little more suspense but yet still easily predictable the only reason finish the film be the slight hope of something unpredictable happening and unfortunately never get that so waste about two hour feel for anyone who be logical thinker that watch this likely the only person this film could catch off guard be somebody 70yr old grandmother
a beautiful movie garden state be the perfect blend of comedy drama and romance in my opinion it a bit of tragedy but not it fill with hope and sadness it will make you laugh and cry the acting be wonderful the directing be wonderful as well especially for first timer this be the exactly the kind of film could watch over and over again highly recommend
it be ok not terrible ok so borrow this movie from buddy and watch it by myself wasn expect much when start it and didn get much just lot of booby but that have to be the only good thing about this movie there be hardly any plot for it and what little there be just dissolve towards the end of the movie as for the act it not great but watchable it a real shame that rob schneider be do movie like this now but anyway if you just want movie with large amount of nudity in it then just watch this give it 2 out of 5 enjoy alex
indiana jones and the comedy of error visually with henry jones junior he be rarely call indiana or indy in this film swim in his baggy grandpa pant and shock of grey white hair peek out under an ever crisp rarely dirty brown fedora you really don get the feeling that you re watch anything historic but few of the old john williams refrain drive something primal bubbling to the surface of those of us who grow up idolize indy the reason that the music be the first thing to be examine here be that it one of very few thing that evoke that sort of reaction in the kingdom of the crystal skull movie fraught with misstep and an obvious misunderstanding of its own audience it exactly the type of summer blockbuster develop to make money at all cost thing blow up there alien and nazis well not nazis so much as russian with grey shirt and jackboot an unnecessary youthful sidekick to bring in the teenager you see and little something extra borrow from bryan singer abominable superman return to ascertain that you know it a spielberg picture the russian be never subtitle see also every arab in munich or about 90 of all german in any film except schindler list this way the evil character can be thoroughly and literally dehumanize the film ooze 1950s russian spy nuclear test screening of howdy doody and dr jones on sort of academic blacklist all take place in the first ten or so minute of the picture as do sad to say the high point of the film for me cameo appearance by neil flynn friend of ford from the fugitive who be best know for his portrayal of the janitor on abc sitcom scrub the filmmaker have discuss at length how while the early jones film be an attempt to capture the magic of 30s and 40s adventure film with contemporary feel the kingdom of the crystal skull will be 50s style action romp with some science fiction sensibility throw in for good measure questionable choice to start as many of those film eventually end up as mystery science theater 3000 fodder in an attempt to capture that feel you have some campy dialogue some stock character and shia laboeuf as arthur fonzerelli there a fairly generic soda fountain brawl initiate by laboeuf and set to the tune of shake rattle roll which solidly plant this film in its era this be an interesting artistic choice because in the previous indy film even with their date stamp the adventure that take place be largely relatively timeless the other aspect of the film that be bind to turn some head it already have both in pre screening and on the internet as eagle eyed fan dissect the trailer be the role that extra terrestrials play in the picture as in spielberg classic close encounter of the third kind there be no dialogue as such share between man and his visitor but their presence be strong and pervasive particularly in the second half of the film use roswell as jump off point it be reveal that the good dr jones have be use as government agent in variety of capacity since we last catch up with him he be colonel in the army apparently and also have work with the cia mi6 and as spy against the russian in the time since hitler autograph his father diary for him in the early 40s the adventure sequence in the picture be hit or miss while some of the car chase and fight sequence be good and lot of the side joke be on the mark there be time marion be injure while drive but mysteriously get good that it hard to follow visually what go on as they try to pack too many character and subplots into fast move sequence many of harrison ford comic moment be on target but other diversion such cgi render prairie dog and laboeuf own private army of monkey bring to mind some of the more artistically questionable moment of return of the jedi and detract from the seriousness of consequence face by our protagonist dr jones also doesn get very much solo screen time henry himself have also become little more cautious in his old age while everyone around him seem to have become more like indiana jones mutt and marion be decisive and powerful figure while indy often find himself sit on the back of motorcycle or behind them in the car shout no don do that it dangerous as action hero go indy have be turn into great family man in case cia agent of dubious allegiance kidnap ex girlfriend and her tagalong son weren baggage enough indy spend most of the film cart around an octogenarian in semi catatonic state who may be the key to find the lost city of gold in the same way that his father be key to the recovery of the holy grail ultimately indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull be film that while not entirely bad be nowhere near worthy of its lofty pedigree as generic action film go it may have provide some level of entertainment in the vein of national treasure it the attachment of indiana jones to the title and the involvement of harrison ford george lucas and steven spielberg that raise expectation and standard to level that none of those individual each shadow of his former self can meet any long it will doubtlessly open at 1 and secure the kind of critical and financial success that guarantee it sequel if all involve want to make one the question really be whether or not they should

please excuse me while commit cinematic sacrilege as it be clearly demonstrate even in this forum many many people love this movie just finish view it myself for the first time and frankly can say that agree be nut maybe all know be d like to put my two cent in for what it worth for an espionage tale like this would have prefer an approach more base on grim realism instead the narrative seem bit too convenient and contrive as if old hitch be try to make the end meet at the last minute somehow never felt the taut tension of his other film that ve immensely enjoy dial for murder rear window psycho the wrong man vertigo to name but few it certainly doesn help that the film contain too many scene that verge on the fantastical level for example there a scene in which gun go off in the living room of house eva marie saint come out of her room and ask what be that noise to which james mason reply we be just wonder about that martin landau just give little shrug and all be forget mean come on d say it pretty hard to mistake gunshot for say somebody drop glass on the floor as mention there be many more scene like this during the course of the movie and every single one of them act as decelerator of the narrative also the overall performance of the cast strike me as rather underwhelming especially when we re talk about some of the fine actor ever to grace the silver screen james mason in particular sleepwalks his way through though can blame him give the fact that his character be so painfully underwritten the bit when cary grant act like he drink be pretty difficult to sit through humor be fine when it work on again believable level like the idea of have normal joe get tangle up in case of mistaken identity international espionage also it do feature some memorable scene especially the famous crop field airplane sequence it really do deserve all the praise it have receive but again it just prove to me that even seemingly sure fire combo like ernest lehman alfred hitchcock can still come up short on the good the second 007 adventure from russia with love receive some hounding because people think it be basically rip off of this movie there be some obvious similarity but in this madman humble opinion from russia with love be the one that achieve good telling of spy story

great concept but need tighter end communism be also be force fed this movie really have me intrigue in the vein of others like the circle snowpiercer etc it have good cast dark atmosphere and feeling of dread and despair throughout it be great for futuristic sci fi fan horror fan gore hound mystery lover or dystopian fan most people will be draw in to the basic but puzzle premise however as so many other film of late it be obvious that the globalist message and communist manifesto message be hard at work to plant themselves into your brain in fact early on the man cellmate even say to him what the hell be you communist know that more pc brainwashing be in store for us from there still will give the writer credit for show some valid reality about world history and society which be somewhat inevitable in human existence thus far even with the best intentioned communist there will always be hierarchy just as in orwell animal farm some animal be more equal than others guess that be the most disturbing fact that worry about most people not comprehend they be return to some lust for socialism communism cultural marxism and the belief that government of man can solve all human problem and inequality while stamp out and silence the evil dissenters the problem be that humanity be infinitely flaw and corrupt regardless and these supposedly universal and benevolent system end up flip on the mass just like capitalism monarchy or any other previous system they rail against at least with capitalism and free market you actually have chance to do good and have somewhat of voice and free will whether you make it or not the past century have clearly show us that capitalism be far superior as be give the public incentive to earn wealth and barter as they choose it be not perfect but neither be humanity communism in its modern form be really just another mean for banker to liquidate and control the wealth asset and life of the sheep for the elite party at the top it be not the grassroots worker movement for equality it masquerade itself to be for more on this study the russian revolution and how it be widely finance and associate with banker western sympathizer and secret society with other goal in mind all that aside the movie be still good but could have be much well with little long runtime that develop the plot and end with more satisfaction as it wind to close it seem to run out of time to wrap up the story and have to rush to disappoint plot hole conclusion they didn have to reveal all of the mystery but have few more detail or reveals would not hurt and some of the plot hole around the asian lady and the kid be bit unfulfilling say 6 or 7 but the first half be more close to 9 just don get catch up too much in all the hollywood echo chamber nonsense and globalist conditioning to the point you sign your wealth and success away to elitist overlord who will simply turn the table back around on you themselves
disappointing after see the trailer for inside out be pretty keen to see it the movie look like it have lot of good idea and all of the people work on the project who know about like this should have be great movie experience for me but instead it be disappointment after move from minnesota to san francisco eleven year old riley kaitlyn dia have to adjust to new life with the help of her emotion joy amy poehler sadness phyllis smith fear bill hader anger lewis black and disgust mindy kaling when joy and sadness be accidentally purge from the control tower along with riley core memory which make riley riley the two have to find their way back as joy and sadness try to do that fear anger and disgust be the only emotion riley have leave to control her in their journey through riley brain back to headquarters joy and sadness come across riley imaginary friend bing bong richard kind who help them find their way through riley brain bing bong be not introduce at any point before his reveal so he just show up out of nowhere without any buildup or previous mention then he become one of the most important character of the whole movie when it come to the character most of them be understandably define to one personality trait happy sad scar angry etc but even the character that aren emotion don have much personality to them riley have as state by the movie five thing that make her who she be and the only one that really add any personality be goof ball her parent diane lane and kyle maclachlan be blank slate their emotion be blank slate who somehow don even show their one emotion and even bing bong lack any real personality along with that joy character arc make little sense she learn of sadness importance to riley but for all we know sadness have only do one thing right that help riley while joy and the other three emotion control her seem to be work for the most part there be no lesson that really need to be learn from the get go of the story because sadness be only need to solve the problem that she start in the first place the story element be lot of the same thing over and over again joy sadness and bing bong try to get to the control center but each time their method of get their be destroy by the accidentally and unknowingly by an emotion or an exterior event like riley sleeping or the brain worker outside of abstract think then they have to try and find way to start everything up again or find new way to riley brain it just go on like that for an hour and thirty minute grant there be some creative element to the movie and some genuinely funny and emotional moment but they be overshadow by the large problem the movie have d say this be the bad pixar movie have see even bad than car and great disappointment
mislead marketing actually make this bad ok first off the link to denzel 2 gun be non existent second despite the cover adkins be in this film for about 15 minute without the false pretense cause by the marketing department this movie could be 4 or even 5 it ok not great but ok the 2 actual lead be watchable but because you come into this expect something else it never really get chance you end up feeling robbed

great theme but alex be member of the carolingian fraction within the christian church and be send to rome when high stand member of the order be find dead during alex investigation he confront by sin eater one who give absolution outside the church who want alex to become the next sin eater the theme premise of this movie have lot of potential unfortunately it isn that well exploit and quickly becomes bogged down due to very disinterested lack of pace and sense of mean while the portrayal of the sin eater idea be good and the carolingian order be nice touch it all seem bite hastily put together without much sense of direction the effect be very good and feel right the acting be generally good heath ledger do lack some with benno fürmann be the best but peter weller also do well while the plot idea effect and act be very good the movie unfortunately isn which be very big shame since the theme have lot to offer but somewhere in the directing or screen write something have go wrong the order only get 5 out of 10 with 4 out of these be for the plot idea effect and act alone
do the director go on holiday for the last third of the film and hand his direct duty to 12 year old kid this will contain major spoiler so reader beware fast and furious 6 just go off its rail scrap that it completely fly off its rail this film turn utterly ridiculous to the point where be leave thinking why there be no need for the film to pan out how it do the first part and should point out main bulk of the film be enjoyable try to track down letty whilst work alongside the very man try to stop them previously hobbs offer something new and interesting and it make for some interesting moment this part of the film felt be good even if they do practically ignore the car side of thing it like they try to force some stuff in there about the car but then they never even show what the car actually where or anything about the flipper car which be actually quite interest the first car sequence in the film they all use bmw 5 series this be major spoiler from now on why if riley be shaw girlfriend would she be order practically to her death throughout the whole film there be whole massive fight scene with letty and herself surely if they be work together that fight just didn need to happen since no one be even there but those two see it so they just have fight for no reason why would riley chase letty so vigilantly she could have let her get away without get herself thrown down some concrete stair they force this twist in the film for some reason then for the main car chase in the film action sequence shaw team capture convoy which be just truck and two jeep can fathom how stupid this actually be because not only do this tiny convoy have hugely power tank inside it also have the chip worth billion and be danger to everyone etc yet this convoy of military personnel be incapable of protect this vital piece of equipment men train in warfare be treat like pawn which the criminal just shrug off with ease do mention the military be aware shaw team be there shaw team notorious for their driving ability and capture of convoy and yet this tank and lorry be just casually drive along with what may as well be no protection at all why why didn they make the convoy seem strong and actually include some intelligent action here for the capture of the tank then they actually capture this tank and shaw team be now military expert who know exactly how to control this tank they needlessly kill dozen of innocent people by crush them to death and no one even seem faze by it now if tank be capture in this way who would come in to stop it not dom and brian the rest of military would utterly ridiculous but accept that be how the film work so don hold that against the film too much that be just your typical mindless action movie stuff it would have be much more interesting if the military get involve alongside the team though then it happen the corny moment have ever see in any film ever letty be catapult over the edge of huge bridge she be fly through the air to her certain death but wait dom then catapult himself from the other side of the bridge there be gap in the middle catch her in mid air and land perfectly onto car to break their fall why do this scene have to exist it awful from this moment on the film go rubbish this moment be where think the director producer writer go on holiday and no longer care they capture shaw at this point and he then reveal his team have take mia hostage fair enough that a decent end and seem like it have set up for the next film perfectly but no hobbs pull gun out and tell everyone how they be go to put load of other life at risk to save one person mia by give shaw his chip and let him go the film then move onto what be quite possibly the most unrealistic action scene ever record in hollywood shaw have casually organise cargo plane to pick them up from this military base where the hell do this cargo plane come from an unauthorised huge military cargo plane shaw just happen to have ready and also access to military base runway this scene be mean to be about shaw get away m not too sure on the science here but if be drive at 150mph onto plane move at 140mph will my car nice and gently stop when get on the plane ramp or will my car suddenly shoot forward from momentum and smash into the inside of plane honestly m not too sure but anyway they kill gisele for seemingly no reason and no one even care they don even rush back to find her they just accept she be dead likely she be but if you be han in this situation do you stand there and accept it shouldn he be get in car and rushing to where she fell to find her not to mention this huge plane explode right next to everyone and no one be even that bother by it just everything about this last scene dislike probably because it be just so unnecessary to begin with they should have just end the film with owen shaw be capture then have ian shaw statham break him free at the start of the next film instead they plonk this last ridiculous action scene in there just because the producer felt like it need it it really didn film start off good then just go off the rail 5 10
instead of this try read orwell for vendetta be weak attempt at political commentary and simplistic illustration of revolution couldn help but laugh at the end with the firework and people think m go to make movie that harp on people ignorance and emotion m go to fill it with image of death for shock factor make knife fly in slow motion instead of bullet like they do in the matrix because can think of anything original and make my protagonist hero terrorist speak so eloquently so that the movie seem smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather come from behind that mask the one thing be impress by be hugo weave ability to recite his line natalie portman be garbage as always character all 1 dimensional the action be generic and predictable when it come to imdb rating some people jump to say that this be the bad movie ever and give it one star that be silly as anyone with brain can see that there be tremendous difference between it and superbabies baby genius which hold bottom spot on this site however it be not even close to worthy of top 250 berth 6 10
just not the right character nothing much can say just disappointed
good but not great don think it be the definitive vietnam war movie indeed that movie probably hasn be make the real issue that stone didn get to be the one the generation that fight wwii recognize which be the futility of war only lie with the foot soldier not with the high echelon in the chain of command war be an end to political mean no matter whether it be righteous war or not this will always be true and be the reason even radical islamics be wag the war they be wag against the rest of the world to achieve their goal of islamic domination same old story new era the issue be that the character of chris and the others in his platoon hold out hope of living when soldier like barnes have already recognize he be dead which allow him to function as soldier need to in war that be the essence of barnes statement when he ask the men after pull the knife on chris killin what do you know about killin think some of the drama be very predictable and contrive as well the idea to put the american soldier in bad light in many instance mean how can you point up some atrocity commit by american if you aren go to show the atrocity they endure no

what lovely day the rationale behind the success of fury road predominantly lie with director george miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he be develop since its first outing in 1979 be evident throughout and it pretty obvious that he know how to craft damn fine action sequence without this passion the film would have likely stoop as there not much else in the way of plot or character development even though theron try her hardest to give us an enthral new action heroine to be revere aside from the aforementioned writing setback fury road be powerhouse in the technical category with stunning contradictory cinematography from john seale give us post apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical mute tone heart pound score from junkie xl and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an oscar one of six for its spectacular vehicle design

i be number four be an absolute bore an excruciatingly awful film my god word can not reiterate how terrible this movie be didn go with high expectation didn expect oscar win performance or witty and sharp script etc thought if could give it five or six out of ten at most would be satisfy with some great action good special effect and reasonable acting but it didn even have that seriously the reviewer who have give this high than four have seriously delude themselves m not teenager which this film be aim for but even then it so badly make even they shouldn like this before critique this film brief synopsis from what can gather teenager john smith alex pettyfer from storm breaker who be an alien from another planet lorien be fugitive on the run from his enemy the mogadarians who have be send to destroy him after kill three other kid before him with the same ability change his identity move from town to town with his guardian henri timothy olyphant john be always the new kid with no tie to his past in the small ohio town he now call home john encounter unexpected life change event his first love sarah dianna agron powerful new ability and connection to the others like number six teresa palmer who share his destiny the first problem of this film be the screenplay which be horrific mess the synopsis have to cobble together from family friend who be fan of the book but wasn of the film it be very loosely explain during the movie at different point with huge plot hole if these mogadarians want to destroy earth why don they straight away why kill these teenager who be part of the legacy how be the legacy and mogadarians create why do the mogadarians want to destroy earth think heard something about resource but what maybe this be explain in the book or subsequent one don know but for someone who hasn read them thing should have be explain and more clearly it no excuse also when john save sarah from her ex boyfriend and his friend pester her at the fair she see him use his power his hand light up to deal with the guy but she dosen say anything what the heck then later she suddenly find out this sort of thing just reeks serious laziness on the hand of the writer either that or during that scene sarah go temporarily blind could go on with several other plot hole but you get the point the structure of the film be terribly put together with certain scene just feel so random without them be link together maybe the fact the film just suddenly decide to introduce new information in convenient way like those weird creature who guard the legacy include dog that turn into the creature and the others for the mogodarian or whatever and while we re on the subject of the mogodarian as villain they be ridiculously laughable and not scary in the slight all the character be bland with little back story like we find out literally nothing about john past or his parent with that you just don care about them as they be little more than cardboard cut out particularly when henri die in one scene with sad music we re mean to care but the character be so shallow and boring we just don care and the whole pathetic scene just come across as sickeningly insincere of course the character be bore also come down to terrible performance alex pettyfer be just unbearably plain and look and act bore he hasn get the slight trace of act ability just like in stormbreakers none of the cast fare any good they be all unconvincing and give some of the bad performance ve see in film even teresa palmer who adore in the sorcerer apprentice could not save this she look great but barely get enough screen time to make an impact with little dialogue couldn judge her act as such though her voice when heard it sound like she be try to be sexy with sore throat the trollop scriptwriter who put in the embarrassingly awful and very cheesy not funny script that she should speak like that need slap be number four try to come across as romantic sci fi action but it have little action for teen boys only about ten minute and even when there be the camera jerk up and down with shock lack of continuity felt dizzy and couldn make out what be go on so as result there be no excitement you feel in watch the action michael bay who be the producer of this and still hasn learnt from transformer 2 and little romance for teen girl with little romance or action the film just pointlessly meander itself sluggishly from scene to scene in term of the romance there be no chemistry between john and sarah and even the special effect be very poor and look too obvious the film be way too predictable with stereotype across the board which you will notice straight away make it unimaginative and repetitive like the rest of the film pay 6 20 to see this abomination wish hadn this be the first turkey of the year ve award for film suppose it be only matter of time this be just complete rubbish and would not advise anyone to see this travesty there will be sequel unfortunately but certainly win be sign up to see it would rather throw up thanks then put myself through see another one of these trust me be number four be that crap would seriously advise you to skip it it be one of the bad film have ever encounter
agonize or brilliant after hour doesn leave much middle ground director martin scorsese do coldly cut comedy sort of like prankster with joy buzzer that really zap you the effect be both rude and sadistic yet some may find irony in this low ball humor luckless griffin dunne chance to meet cute flake rosanna arquette one night in new york city but follow up date be fraught with calamity and character apparently just sprung from nuthouse the attractive supporting performer include teri garr linda fiorentino john heard thomas chong and cheech marin be not use to balance out the craziness in the material with their star personas everyone on screen be just little bit batty than the one who come before and once you ve become attuned to the movie intentionally bumpy rhythm the cinematic equivalent of bumper car the rest of the picture can be very funny lark however with so many cipher on display and absolutely no mercy show from our director be too aware of the material as gag comedy it never less than well do and have an amazing full circle finish but there nothing substantial about after hour all the requisite scorsese style be waste really on piffle

it a shame what they do to these poor animal it a shame what they do to these poor animal in this show train bear multiple cow and horse who get abuse in rodeo it just heartbreaking to watch which don do and don understand how sich show can survive in the 21th century
disappointed warning spoiler read the book before watch this movie get it book for my birthday and be absolutely amaze read it in 2 day literally and after ve heard about the movie normally be excite and expect so much oh boy be wrong matt damon and all the other actor do an amazing job but what didn like be that they stretch out the movie and also they miss some important part of the movie like for example they didn show at all how he spoiler change the rover and how he have problem with the drill they miss the sandstorm part they miss the part where the rover flip and that may not be critical part for the story but think the movie would be so much good if they add that also they could ve work so much on the main character he be show zero emotion he never talk about how he miss his family wife nor anything on the planet earth he didn care too much if he survive or not he realize that he have the chance to survive but also have chance of not survive and be not to shock by the situation from the very begin he be very calm don think that a realistic scenario mean he just wake up on deserted planet with satellite antenna in his chest and he just walk right back in the habitat and just stitch himself without show much shock or any other emotion they make him so relax that he even start make really bad joke would be lot good if you do the whole just wake up on mar and don know how will survive part well sorry but that a big problem second thing that bother me science fact this be minor problem but the movie be crowd with scientific fact that didn bother me but think that it not really suitable to use some of the fact and science talk when do movie that aim to the general audience there may be lot of people who didn understand some of the part of the movie because of that that my personal impression now don want to be too negative so also want to add couple of bright side of this movie film edit special effect be really impress by the filming have to admit overall m not satisfy so much potential yet they blow it would compare this movie to the movie gravity such good story yet they didn meet the expectation of the general audience
moby dick meet dragon in right medieval muddle be actually sort of intrigue if somewhat dubious but no matter how bad think it could ve go honestly be not expect it to be this bad almost dungeon dragon bad be not go to detail how far it deviate from moby dick you can tell from the plot summary it be go to and be go to judge age of the dragon on its own merit age of the dragon sadly doesn have many good merit if any at all the landscape and scenery be reasonably good in scale but dully lit lack true sense of wonder the editing be choppy while the dragon effect be not bad as such but nothing to be thrill about either as the dragon themselves actually aren used very well at all the music lack sparkle and feel sluggish but it be the story character and especially the script that sink age of the dragon further the character be more irritating than engage and have resort to fantasy clichés rather than the complex character of the original story the story be slow and predictable with the action scenes the anti thesis of thrilling and the fantasy element lack imagination the script be terrible one of the bad script of any film recently consist of corny stilted dialogue and just very humourless and stiff in tone the act fare little better the main female be small bright spot because she be hot and her acting doesn rely too much on it vinnie jones however be very bland while danny glover other than the premise the main selling point of me see age of the dragon in the first place chew the scenery to piece and in the end it be painful to watch him overall right medieval muddle humourless unimaginative predictable clichéd and dull everything fantasy adventure movie should not be 1 10 bethany cox
bad in so many way that almost walk out something have never ever do be amaze that most of the post review be so favorable much too long much too melodramatic no character development no motivation really riddle with anachronism and remarkably unlikely happening shallow and sensationalist at the beginning have hope for joaquin phoenix character and the story arc of ewa and magda but those just petered out into emotionality plot twist that could have add depth to our perception of the character and event be hide until near the end when they be just lose in the climactic excess of emotion and aforesaid melodrama have now have lifetime surfeit of marion cotillard look angelic and tearful or fearful why couldn they give her something more to do also though phoenix turn in predictable tour de force performance believe he be capable of more better but ala think it would have to be with different director guess it a good thing that there be so much polish speak but it really didn add anything to the movie just to the director ego suppose they could have use those effort well in make sure the english be appropriate for the time and place suggest you not spend your money on this one watch it if they put it on tv it colorful and maybe they will cut its run time little and that will improve it m sure m give it 2 instead of 1 because it be still professionally execute it the material that the problem
okay bore slow sometimes good okay bore slow sometimes good special effect good some good action scene start off very slow boring no character development johnny depp character seem to overdo it the movie be more about event and it forget to infuse human element and character into it okay little good than average for summer movie the set costume and special effect be good than the movie itself
brilliant stunning and disturbingly entertaining few film be as sensational or infamous as stanley kubrick a clockwork orange it impossible to sit through aco and not have reaction whether it be shock disgust or amazement the savage tale of brutal young droog and his subsequent reformation by the government be as shock and thought provoking as ever while the film depiction of violence and sex be what it most know for aco work on far deep level the disturb portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of government attempt to create good society be brilliant but the most fascinating aspect of aco be the question it pose about good and evil while the crime alex commits at the beginning of the film be atrocious what the government do to him be bad the film present the absolute bad aspect of man but show that even these be still favorable to man without the choice people can denounce the film because of its brutal content but the importance of the question it pose can be deny equally excellent to the film content be the effort by the crew kubrick perfectionism pay off well as aco in one of his most visually striking film malcolm macdowell be nothing short of amaze as alex kubrick use of surreal imagery and set piece as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on screen action create world that perfectly reflect the protagonist behavior and the government policy clockwork orange be by no mean an easy film to get through as many will be turn off by the scene of violence and rape but this masterpiece be far more complex than simple romp through world of youthful violence it a rare example of film making that demand that the viewer actually think real horrorshow all around oh my brother
gyllenhaal at his best nightcrawler from the very beginning be not traditional hollywood film it certainly do not follow the narrative of one and even though it have the three act structure we be all familiar with it spin them around this be particularly evident in the third act incredibly suspenseful with brilliant almost anti climax suspense be the main key to this film success it build and build to the point where the last twenty minute of the film be completely unpredictable dan gilroy in his directorial debut here have show real understanding of how to keep an audience engage and follow character who isn an easy man to spend great deal of time with gilroy screenplay be fast paced and one of the fine this year the script focus the audience on the character louis bloom particularly yet the supporting character be just as impressive by bill paxton and rene russo alike it doesn follow the rule of typical script we be introduce instantly to criminal and this man be suppose to be our protagonist yet what become clear be that there be not protagonist in nightcrawler jake gyllenhaal louis bloom be the antagonist he can be describe as nothing less than psychopath and his portrayal by gyllenhaal be one of his great performance he be very gaunt here lose lot of weight for the role however that be not the main reason for his impressive performance gyllenhaal be an actor who continue to impress me his work in enemy from earlier this year be just as brilliant he have choose excellent role in film such as zodiac prisoner and end of watch the cinematography be also fantastic night time la have not look this good since 2011 drive all these element come together to make captivate piece of filmmaking film expect will be discuss more as time go on
epic fail we watch this at home as rental the pacing be okay and there be enough plot point to keep the viewer watching and make it interest it be largely predictable but not in particularly annoy way my husband and discuss several possible twist during the film finally decide on the scenario that turn out to be correct even so it be decent film until the very end when my rating go from 5 to 2 be willing to accept the private detective who give unrealistically timely and incredibly incorrect update what win accept be that the police don follow even the most basic of crime scene procedure after the shoot the most inept coroner would notice that tony have not fire any gun and cursory swab analysis of sarah hand would show that she have two different powder on them be not compare this to the unrealistic standard of an episode of csi bone or criminal mind where the world supposedly best forensic mind have access to the world best and sometimes futuristic crime scene forensic technology even overwork ny city cop would have do swab in what might seem an open and shut case maybe especially in this case as cop tend to be suspicious by nature
brilliant movie awesome sci fi worth wacthing it edge of tomorrow be an unique installment on the list of the top sci fi movie of all time as every movie it consist of 4 stage the first act introduction preparation for the story the second act action scenes the third act final climax and the final act resolution end the director doug liman do brilliant work with the first and second act of this film however the third act be bit different and not as climatic as would want it to be moreover expect it to be boring movie beacause of the fact and we would be watch the same day over and over again thankfully be wrong every loop and repetition of this day be different than the others in an unique way this make the movie very interesting to see how doug liman manage to acomplish this director challenge all in all it be an awesome movie with brilliant plot and good actor hope there be sequel which keep all of the advantage and turn the disadvantage into more advantage and be sure that doug liman will do so to sum up it be worth watch movie with clever characteristic in it every frame feel like loop worth sit in must see movie however be as always cautious not to have very high expectation in order not to ruin good movie

some new animo in the horror genre when you expect kind of the exorcist variant with person possess by demon ranting and rave while be chain to bed vomit green slime recite incoherent fragment of text in foreign language that he she doesn master and spin his her head around in supernatural way then you re waste your time with at the devil door because this be not that type of film but if you be lover of the more subtle horror genre with nasty undertone and sinister menacing atmosphere create by the use of shadow move object and constant palpable threat then this be must see of course there will be grumble about the lack of depth of the character and of real scare firstly think horror isn always successful by use irritate artificial fright as in the quite one where they use deafen sound effect or by excessive use of gore element to me horror be brilliant when even if these element be apply to the minimum and it still have nasty and devilish atmosphere and you don need profundity to create that suggest you watch shakespearean drama when you re into that you also don expect scary moment while watch romcom it all start with teenage girl call hannah ashley rickards who make the mistake to accept the invitation of her boyfriend to play an innocent game and as reward get 500 for do that in ramshackle caravan somewhere in the middle of desert an eccentric horrid guy play cup game with her and come to the conclusion that she be choose and she should go to particular intersection and speak out her name so that he will know her when the time be right to call her year later we meet the real estate agent leigh catalina sandino moreno who go to sell an abandon house which later appear to have be the parental home of hannah together with her sister vera naya rivera she be suck into demonic game where evil be try to nest in human society at the devil door basically cover the same theme as told in goethe work faust the closing of pact with the devil and give your soul in exchange in this case it not really voluntary but it kind of the same idea the scene in hannah bedroom suggest that it will turn out to be typical horror about possession and that an accumulation of clichés will be the result nothing could be far from the truth the story very slowly unravels sinister plot while use the principle of less be more this paranormal horror in which mix of the exorcist and rosemary baby be interweave with little family drama make sure you haven get clue where it lead too in addition there be some surprising twist in the story which sufficiently compensate the lack of some decent fright there be some extremely strong fragment in it like hannah bedroom scene the little red rid hood type of girl who turn babysitter night into hysterical experience for the concerned parent leigh confrontation with evil and the ultrasound the possession flash through my head for second simple and unspectacular portray subtle and exciting at the same time the two main player catalina sandino moreno and naya rivera be two outstanding actress and beautiful at the same time for once they aren like most girl in horror film run around screech and be slaughter by some demonic power they be intelligent go getters who defend themselves they both have very different role in this film and divide the whole into two additional episode and the little girl ava acre who play the girl at the end have such minimal role but play it in such terrifying way most will call the end weak and disappointing personally think it fit the entire movie and make it pretty open end so sequel isn unthinkable all praise to nicholas mccarthy who try to create some new enthusiasm in the horror genre more review at http opinion as moviefreak blogspot be

poor movie don know why other people think this movie be so great think they re happy that tolkien classic have be bring to the big screen cinematography and special effect be only average story be to me rather bore character be artificial and lacked believability so why the high rating saw this movie in the theater with my girlfriend and after see this movie be rather apologetic to my girlfriend because she didn enjoy it and know that didn enjoy it it an epic give it that but most people in this movie just have sad expression or no expression at all just couldn get any energy out of this movie the movie be such disappointment that cancel my plan to see all its sequel the only reason didn give this movie 1 10 be it be well than catwoman and could tell that the director and actor put in sincere effort into make tolkien classic come to life
a magical story behind the poorly direct film everyone who deeply interested in folklore as dare to say be know the story of the fairy of cottingley it one nearly epic story of the two girl who inadvertently make half of the world actually believe in magical creature don count child for they do they do and they will believe and that wondrous and the best part of the epic be that they have never straightforwardly confess that they ve forge it just not to ruin people glimpse of faith in magical if that what this movie should have be tell about then it certainly do not the job despite the wonderful and believable acting of florence hoath and elizabeth earl the incoherent screenplay and direction ruin everything and only shadow of the childhood magic remain in the dark corner push away by the social drama clichés they even manage to insert there villain and the goddammit comic relief and the top notch cgi doesn help out there more magic even in ghost story movie such as lady in white or the changeling worth watch but only once deeply hope that some day someone will make movie worthy of this story spiritual background so you understand why some perfectly sane people believe in fairy even without the photograph one of my favorite book be the collection of narrative tale record in the middle of the 20th century among the siberian villager mostly in the chita region by p zinovyev and the thing really love and adore in those story be that those people actually believe all the folklore thing they re speak about it grievous that there be less and less such people live in this world of that kind who believe because of the purity of the heart not because of fear or passion some call those people dark and unenlightened some laugh at them but the thing they actually have be the faith whilst everyone else have only ghost of it that who know can not believe

don be fool by the cinematic excellence downfall be dangerous as far as film go downfall be excellent the acting by all concern particularly of bruno ganz as hitler be inspire the reconstruction of hitler bunker and of the atmosphere within and without it in the last day of the war so far as anyone can judge be very realistic and convince the script which draw on two separate historical document record hitler final day be well construct and the directing of the entire film be on the whole be immaculate however some film be more than mere vehicle for entertainment downfall be arguably one of the most important world war ii film ever make for one simple reason it be german film that german director should finally decide to tackle this subject be itself commendable but the resulting film though excellent in itself leave much to be desire in fact it be potentially dangerous downfall have win world wide acclaim and audience around the world be move by the portrayal of the nazi high command as vulnerable human being and not dehumanised monster unfortunately by allow the film to do so audiences around the world be be dupe into believe one of the most spectacular myth post war germany have concoct about the relationship between the german people its army and the nazi party lead by hitler while not excuse the german support of hitler the film be mean to make the german people feel well about themselves by spread the myth that hitler be mad the army and its general heroic and most of hitler staff either ignorant of germany inhuman war crime or somehow conflict about their role in the war this utter nonsense shy away from take responsibility for the true horror of wwii german film focus on the war could have focus on any part of it do the director choose to depict the rise of the nazi party to power do he choose to portray the horror of crystal nacht and the rise of institutionalised anti semitism do he choose to focus on the unprovoked invasion of poland or the final solution for the problem of european jew no the director choose to focus on the final day of the war when the nazi may be portray as vulnerable and as confused band of misguided dreamer who put their faith be madman who lead them to destruction this view of historical event be not only disturb but frighteningly worry come from german director even though it be predictable the only way most young german today can cope with their past be to convince themselves of this myth to convince themselves that their grandparent be all young traudl junges sweep into the nazi mania out of ignorance fear poverty and sense of national shame after the surrender of world war which incidentally the german also start but just because the german need to believe in this to get on with their life in modern day europe doesn mean the rest of the world have to buy into it just like the memoir of miss junge on which this film be base the result film be just that subjective impression colour by guilt denial and self loathing to hail it as historically accurate objective and self examining be reckless and foolish case in point be the portrayal of speer speer be one of hitler closest confidant and key architect of the final solution he be rabid fascist anti semite who lay the architectural plan for all of the third reich future center of power during the nuremberg trial speer plead ignorance of the nazi death camp and claim he be only an architect of building while the other caught nazi be execute speer receive light prison sentence he be eventually release and die of old age in the comfort of his home historian for long time since then have expose speer lie it be well establish fact that he hoodwink his captor and get away with what very few of the nazi do but the film embrace speer benign and false self portrayal as mild mannered sympathetic man who attempt to convince hitler to surrender and be really little more than an over zealous designer of building downfall be very good film but audience should not be fool by its oblique propaganda move on and allow modern day german to cope with their past be one thing but to promote the idea that the entire war be the fault of one very unstable man be dangerously absurd one of the film tag line speak by the real life traudl junge be that be young be not an excuse well that just not good enough it be only when the german look themselves in the mirror and confront the harsh reality of their history that the rest of the world could maybe one day move on and forgive while never forget
tough solid crime story think saw the 1994 re make before ever check this movie out the re make be so sexual and violent expect less of that stuff in here because it be make 20 some year earlier well there be less sex but think the violence might even have be heavy in this movie this be pretty rough film and it interest to note the pg today this would be rat at minimum pg 13 also contrast between the two film language wise back then you hear lot more usage of the lord name in vain nowadays the word be more popular good guy steve mcqueen in here never utters bad word and be still tough no nonsense kind of guy the rest of the character be the same there be no talk before shoot hokey scene or people miss from point blank range mcqueen be great as he usually be and the rest of the cast be pretty interesting too from sleazy sally struthers pre all in the family to love story ali mcgraw to old timer ben johnson and slim pickens al letterei be also good in here his name isn familiar to me but his face be with either this or the re make you get solid crime action story with the getaway
worth watch the film be about cop name nishi that have have lot of bad thing happen lately and be down on his luck his wife have terminal cancer and when lash out one of his fellow cop get kill and one get paralyze when he off the force he decide to rob bank pay off his loan shark and go on trip with his wife until she die the loan shark keep bother him after he pay them off so he have to respond with violence throughout it a good idea for movie than an actual movie in my opinion think lot of it may be translation issue or cultural difference many time throughout the film they say thing too exact and it doesn feel like actual people would talk like that like m cop and you be yakuza so we be enemy that not an actual quote but that the right idea

great 80s fun there be many film about vampire but one that be almost always remember with shy smile on the face be definitely the lost boy as one of the best remembered film of the 80s this movie have become part of pop culture and defining film for that period as it showcases most of what be cool or hip in that decade while its status as horror classic have lot to do with the nostalgic factor it an entertaining film on its own right and its modernization of the vampire myth along with its tongue in cheek humor still make for charm and funny session of pure mindless entertainment the movie begin with lucy emerson dianne wiest as she move to santa clara california with her two teenager son michael jason patric and sam corey haim after bitter divorce in santa clara michael become involve with local gang of bikers who have dark and mysterious secret while sam becomes friend with two weird boy who claim that the town be be invade by vampire and its their mission to get rid of them as michael begin to act strange sam suspect that his brother have become one of the undead and begin to take his friend seriously direct by joel schumacher the lost boy be movie that effectively combine cool and attractive look with simple but entertain plot result in successful and charming film the story modernize classic element of the vampire myth and adapt it to its time with intelligence and definitely tongue in cheek humor in fact this self aware comedy approach be what make the film enjoyable and it rely more on fun and laughs than in actual scare the plot be rather simple and lack some character development but it make an interesting although also quite simplistic analogy between the trouble of youth and become vampire visually the movie look great although by now it have that date nostalgic look of past decade still the flamboyant visual composition fit perfectly in the film time and context and it be one of the film big asset schumacher fluid and energetic camera work make the movie flow at with nice rhythm and the movie never become dull or bore the cast be very effective and everyone make great job corey haim be remarkably good and while he may not be good actor in this film he be perfect for the role of sam jason patric be less lucky and he be overshadow by the very talented kiefer sutherland who steal every scene with his charm and presence jami gertz give somewhat forgettable performance but veteran dianne wiest and edward herrmann be both excellent in their role and have some funny line the lose boy suffers lot from its own self referential nature it look old and severely date by now even when it 20 year ago when it be release for the first time the cleverly write plot be very entertaining but somehow the lack of character development and the comedy take on the story make it to never reach its full potential the premise be quite interesting but the lost boys theme be never fully explore leave at nice but bit shallow experience definitely most of the charm of the lose boy be due to nostalgia as the movie be now basically time capsule of the 80s however it be hard to deny that despite be what one would call popcorn movie in its time it be an intelligent original and fresh take on vampire while it may not be landmark of horror of life change experience the lost boy be one of those film that will definitely deliver what they promise healthy dose of mindless entertainment
a very enjoyable movie contrary to lot of the review ve read so far think this be very good movie in almost every respect can actually think of criticism the acting be excellent by the entire cast the cinematography flow the mood be sustain the main character be strong independent and the film describe journey come of age many corner be turn by several of the cast felt the story have great heart character and relationship be explore the script be sharp and perceptive there be much to read in between the line what can say the film have sex in it big deal it be only the backdrop it as if some reviewer be disappoint there be no moral opprobrium not enough grubbiness be we to be unimpressed because the film doesn have negative take on the porn industry this seem to me to possibly be reflection of prior expectation isn there room nowadays for film which don necessarily wring their hand about porn it not as if we be gon na come away and think the porn industry be all wonderful
pull the most out of an okay story ratatouille be major step up from lot of last year 39 animate fare and vast improvement from last year 39 oscar winner for best animate feature here we re discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story tell technique of pixar and here 39 the kicker no heavy hand message hammer in with drill but there certainly be message and it 39 deliver with subtler grace despite some flaw although aspect to the message be borderline confuse if you over analyze the reality that occur in the film but the film doesn 39 scream for over analyzation in the same fashion as quot find nemo quot for me the animation slightly overpower the story and that 39 not necessarily bad thing the film be direct camera wise with the same interesting technique as quot happy foot quot but the film have more in store we get to see the world mainly from remmy 39 perspective and it 39 visually excite the camera work be what make the film 39 physical humor work so well more on the artistic scheme the film look really great particularly the light stand out the color be very lush and detailed very accurate toward real city scape then the rat 39 fur be very impressive it move against the wind and get wet very much like real rat hair don 39 let the detail in the clothes get past you either the film manage to find balance between superficial realism and animate character the character design for the human be marvelous bird seem to get much humor out of the small villain as see in the past quot incredibles quot and the non pixar film quot shrek quot and the rat while move lot like real rat still have acceptable personality and animated form so we feel like we 39 re enter an animated world that be fleshy and real speaking of such other animate marvel be the organic form of the food as real as the food in the film be the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursue it introduce the viewer into the world of fine dinning and develop something rare in today 39 animation bleed heart br br story wise that 39 the only area where can detect any trace of criticism felt at time dare say it that the emotion be little bit forced there be just certain time didn 39 understand certain character 39 frustration also felt uneasy about the film unusual balance of fantasy and realistic theme such as how the reaction to rat be carry our toward the end of the film and how it blend into the film major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrence that lack of coherent continuity give writer lot more flexibility in how to tell the story in other word it 39 kind of shortcut but it 39 an observation that be make up for by other success in the film the film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional theme with little more depth to truly enjoy it 39 recommend erase the fact that rat often carry disease from your mind it 39 cute without embarrassingly force it and unpretentious the very fact that what make it work may fly over the head of small child isn 39 a reason to condemn it it 39 true though that feel that young kid may get little restless halfway though and not just through my own experience at the theater however this be another great film for an old audience to enjoy simple well told story as for whether it will have that last effect that pixar film usually carry only time will tell
a weird disjoint dishonest bore the brief existence of the sex pistol and the making of this film after the controversial groundbreaking english punk band break up both happen before be bear however start listen to their only album never mind the s here the sex pistol in 2003 when be teenager and quickly become big fan didn see the great rock roll swindle until 2006 but saw it couple time that year and think it be pretty good certainly not great but pretty good even if could only remember bit of it and didn see how it all connect see it third time nearly three year after the second didn care much for it at all m not even sure what find so good about most of it in the first place can remember now this film be mockumentary in which sex pistol manager malcolm mclaren tell his side of the story of the band and its member guitarist steve jones credit here as the crook drummer paul cook credit as the tea maker bassist sid vicious credit as the gimmick and john lydon k johnny rotten credit as the collaborator mclaren claim that he create the band and even the genre of punk rock as scam to make money he tell much of the story to helen wellington lloyd k helen of troy in various place where they go together it basically hodgepodge of mclaren talk pistols song live footage of the band fictional scene often silly strange one several cartoon sequence etc all put together in one film to tell the pistol manager side of the story in bizarre way it have be well prove that mclaren be liar know many have already point this out include band member themselves he be not the drive force of the band he didn create them nor do he invent punk rock and the sex pistols weren even the first punk band though they be unique the band member be the one who make the band what it be the filth and the fury much more believable film about the band from julien temple who make this film be tell from the point of view of the band member who contradict mclaren claim however the dishonesty of the great rock roll swindle be not my big problem with it if it be actually entertain which use to think it be to certain extent would be able to overlook that like obviously use to be able to do during my third view apart from sex pistol songs some live footage and at least one mildly amuse cartoon sequence it be pretty dull find the who kill bambi song mildly amuse at first but it get tire very quickly be this mockumentary worth watch for sex pistol fan it seem good number of fan would say it be not to learn about the true story of the short live but groundbreaking 70 punk band but for entertainment that be once my opinion on the great rock roll swindle after the first time watch it couldn remember thing mclaren say and by the time saw it the second time be aware of what the pistols manager be use this film to imply but could still barely remember anything heard him say obviously other aspect of the film be what find impressive now after my third viewing can definitely remember some of the thing mclaren say but it still wasn 100 clear like most of the film guess his word be not that memorable probably because of the way they be present if you re pistol fan guess it wouldn hurt to give swindle try but to me for the most part it just an incoherent boring mess that try to be funny but fails
they should have call it something else have watch the trailer be so look forward to this film and even take my friend as the bible account of noah can fit into page of a4 obviously the film maker have to add lot of plot to fill it out to feature length film indeed there be lot of scope to do this noah wife and his three daughter in law be hardly mention in the bible not even be name so the film maker have to develop their character and could create interesting sub plot around the various relationship in the film noah have series of dream about the flood now this be not mention in the bible but it be certainly one of the method god use to communicate with men so it be an addition rather than distortion and add bit of excitement and give them chance to show off their skill with cgi but to call the film noah surely require that they leave the basic story line intact but they didn the angel who come to earth because they fancy the woman be turn into bizarre stone men very uncomfortable for the woman but they didn go into that as consequence the bible description of what happen to their offspring have to be abandon instead of take three daughter in law onto the ark they take one girl friend who noah thought be infertile one of noah enemy manage to sneak onto the ark without noah knowledge perhaps the bad thing in my opinion be that god be leave on the side line and couldn even make the decision himself to preserve human or not so leave that decision to noah so whether or not we agree with the personality they decide to give noah be matter of individual taste drug the animal so they didn interfere with the film may have be cop out but we could have go along with that but play fast and loose with the story just seem unnecessary who be the film aim at all in all very disappointing bring back cecil demille
highly overrate simply can not understand why this film rat so highly the best part be emma stone act but other than that there be virtually nothing worth praise if this be an attempt to revive the classic film musical of the forty and fifty it fail utterly in my opinion the main problem be that emma stone can sing and ryan gosling can act another problem be that in many of the other musical number include the opening one in the la traffic jam you can hear the lyric as an actor ryan gosling reminds me of sixty actor david jansen who play richard kimble in the fugitive tv series he have one or at the most two facial expression overall the story be fairly boring too m write this review about two week after see the movie and have no desire to see it again m probably be generous in rating this 4 10
ok action philosophy flick not exactly sci fi this be not really sci fi movie like the first two it ok but the philosophy in this movie be more philisophical double talk than serious philosophy like in the second movie be hop for return to the action sci fi flick the original be where they actually provide explanation for what happen and cut the b but that not to be find in this one you will leave the theatre wonder why anything happen in the movie
memorable film of jewish oppression during wwii this film be for those old than 16 it be not chic flick nor family film it be think provoke film deal with the jewish oppression in wwii the film capture your attention and hold it throughout the film the actor liam neeson ben kingley and ralph fiennes do give stellar performance however it be the support cast which make the film work would have rat it high if the film could have stay within my 2 hour bottom limit although memorable film and film which deal with such politically charge subject feel that be not so entertained as be educate even though it be work of fiction not film for those want entertainment it be think provoke film that all should watch at some time
not my cup of tea admittedly under the tuscan sun be not really my type of movie go home for weekend to see my parent and my sister really have no objection to see this movie like the old saying go don knock it until you try it because some movie may surprise you well under the tuscan sun didn really do that for me this isn necessarily bad thing think my mom and sister enjoy it particularly the joke about the butt facial toilet my dad and chuckle but we weren really bowl over the scenery be pretty nice and imagine this movie be great for people that either want to go to italy or have fond memory of vacation there didn fit in any of those category so that wasn much of big deal to me really the only redeeming factor for me in this movie be diane lane she be definitely one of the most beautiful actress around think can watch her in about anything no matter how bad the movie may be as long as diane lane be in it that movie wouldn be complete loss in conclusion don feel can slam this movie too harshly because be definitely not its target market think it do have great appeal to certain audience out there but for me it wasn anything special my imdb rating 5 10 my yahoo grade flaw but worthy

too strange to hold much meaning unless you re historian sadly m not big fan of surrealist film zerograd or city zero be film that feel like it take place in strange unnatural world it have some grounding in the fact that the main character seem to recognize how everything be strange so he go on this journey with us but the lack of any cohesive story structure be more than could bear do recognize that there be purpose underlie all of this because zerograd be make at particular time in russian history when thing be change dramatically and the filmmaker be try to make point about the strange new world they be experience however since don have strong connection to that time and place in history the film felt like nonsense not only do it feel strange but it also have somewhat frustrating storyline because the protagonist be be mistreat and force into an unfair position by the end without spoil anything be more annoyed than ever and it leave me feel hopeless m confident that for those who might have live through these event or those who be interested in explore the history of post soviet russia zerograd could be an interesting film to explore and analyze for me however it be merely an oddity that mean very little while there be strange and humorous moment that ll never forget that didn make for story that engage me in any fashion
room show that live in one room all the time be bore this movie have appeal mainly to woman and feminine type base only on emotion br br the strength and devotion of the mother toward her child be well portray however and the boy do great job of act like spoil and over protect child the mother 39 love in spoil the boy give the terrible circumstance be quite loving and appropriate though br br the movie be boring as would be live in small room for 5 year without ever go out that be the essence of this film br br naturally the critic and those with more emotion than intellect be gush over it br br watch it and find out if be wrong

bemuse sorrow don know what people be expect from this movie think everyone be expect something different to happen everything that be suppose to happen that be say be go to happen in the other film happen do people not like the way it happen everything feel like everyone be capable of do more than their character do like neo for instance he mostly have the role of fight and he always do it really well but yet it feel like he be about to make break through to something else but never do this movie revolve so much more around everyone else other than neo it worth watch everyone struggle so much passion in everyone so much love in it with everyone you can really feel it that make me feel happy in sad way the last fight scene by far be the most beautiful thing ve ever see in live action movie but win give it 10 just because of that it be like watch an anime beautiful very well do anime still simply feel like ve be hit over the head really hard with something not hard like bat but more like bulky big back pack and don feel like say anything back to the people that do it because it felt good in way but not really it just like you walk away cause you cant stay behind you simply have to move on can just say wish this movie have be well although it be pretty good wish could love it but cant
overrate colorful movie do not say this be pixar best movie that an offence to pixar itself coco be visually please animate film with stunning color nothing more be disappoint really thought pixar movie on the day of the dead could have great potential but that potential be waste rather than celebration of mexican culture what have see be celebration of the american perception of mexican culture in respectful way at least this be no surprise though what make it impossible for me to enjoy this movie be the way the plot be sacrifice in order to deliver the be who you want to be lesson the first part of the movie focus so much on this one idea with so many clichés it even make me consider leave the theater but as say the color make it pretty film and be hop d be enjoy some of pixar excellent humor at some point that never come this movie will make you chuckle couple time but that it it lack pixar magical combination of plot humor and feeling they come up with one or two good idea and death be depict in really nice way but the plot be so scarcely developed some event remain unexplained completely useless element be give lot of importance within the story while the truly interesting bit get very little space coco simply didn seize the moment
really cartoon cartoon be you serious this be awful waste of time

surprisingly lackluster on the surface gary mckendry killer elite have all the making for fun action pack popcorn flick even with talented actor like robert de niro jason statham and clive owen killer elite fail to be grip or thrill due to the stale subject matter and flat direction there be surprisingly little fun to be have with the mediocre act from our lead or the dull and forgettable action sequence killer elite rarely realize it potential for fun action flick and end up just another forgettable and completely disposable bore because of it it really be hard to criticize killer elite for it dull subject matter as it claim to be base on true story but the story tell here be nothing we ve never hear before the story be simply recently retire agent blackmail to do one final job even though it be base on true story it still feel recycle and uninspired although there be actually one aspect to the story that be fairly interesting and quite enjoyable the contract that be to be carry out by the team must be make to look like accident and these short hit scene be admittedly quite awesome while these scene be entertain and clever they only make up small portion of the film run time make the rest an increasingly tedious slog there be noticeable lack of substance that plague killer elite as it struggle to generate any interesting idea or plot development even some of the action scenes lack adrenaline or excitement due to the shoddily choreograph hand to hand combat and gunplay killer elite be certainly watchable but there be very few redeemable quality to make you ever want to watch the film again the story aside from the assassination be mediocre the character be flimsy and the action be unimpressive and dull even if you be just look for fun and disposable action flick killer elite only manage to be completely disposable an uninteresting story be play out by seemingly uninterested actor make the entire experience feel cheap it impossible to recommend killer elite to anyone as the lack of substance make it mere skeleton of the film that it could be additionally on less relevant note there be something noticeably off about 68 year old robert de niro wield machine gun
nowhere near as good as it think it be this smug little kaleidoscope of low life have lot of potential but like lot of its writer work have age horribly as it can no longer corner the market on movie with zany style and now must view in term of its substance not just its style the meandering nature of the narrative really have no narrative there be no intrigue or sense of development it not an anthology movie but it almost be and therefor each scene can only really be enjoy as thing in itself without context and so lacks both the ground work and the sense of consequence that would make them classic it sort of sad to watch it desperately just try to produce iconic or quotable moment after moment rather than apply itself to something real back bone it sort of enjoyable for its sheer bombasticity but it get old really quickly with no character want to root for which would be fine if only there be some sense of pay off on any of the character fat some people jack themselves off to this movie freshness but think this be another case of something that be fresh for its time age horribly and its endure cult status be mixture of nostalgia emperor new clothes and people not willing to look behind the make up to see what pander little flick this really be it have its moment but it never seem to aspire to more than sequence of moment rather than movie in the familiar sense you could argue its meditation of fate and consequence but that just sound nice way of say it wasn think through well it not just tedious for long stretch it kind of annoys me
the real star here be the car have mix feeling about this movie do prefer movie that be little more intelligent per say but still feel go in sixty second be quite underrated actually my big complaint be that the movie be too short there be simply too much story and way to many character to fit into the movie time frame the basic story be about car thief cage who have achieve legendary status and then retire his younger brother try to be like his brother fall into car boost too but soon get in too deep and end up on the hit list of ruthless crime lord after he mess up very important job now the only way to save his brother life be for cage to come out of retirement and finish the job strealing fifty high profile car in one night together with many other top thief they set out to do the impossible while the cast be truly star stud with big name such as nicholas cage angelina jolie and rober duvall most of the acting and character aren that sympathetic the movie simply have too many character to really get deeply into any of them delroy lindo do fairly engaging job as the old arch nemesis of the protagonist and cage be good as usual but the rest of the cast be nothing special except perhaps for the mysterious coroner who never talk sphynx but the movie be still worth watch for the suspenseful action and the truly incredible chase scene at the end be there anything more beautiful then that shelby mustang gt nickname eleanor roar down the street of los angoles there be many other exotic car in this movie too from very unique hummer to lambourgini diablo don go into this movie expect deep and involve dramatic story while it do attempt at this it doesn necessarily succeed but the action be suspenseful and although tad unrealistic at time it be great kick to watch this movie be well then the average action movie true classic for the car chase genre my rating 1 2 out of other recommendation bourne supremacy the italian job 1969 smokey and the bandit
this be great stuff with hidden gift the topic seem puerile so ignored this film until notice good average rating from critic then watch and at first felt bore but stick despite it miserable pace pedestrian production value and cliche realize there must be some redeem value because it seem like religious hate speech barely mask with good intent be confuse little at first by its handful of laugh out loud moment that arise from naive character say stupid thing for example one character start rant to friend with some mixture of shock and relish at tell disturb secret about disgust scene in partial birth abortion film she be show in class and her friend cut her off say don ruin it for me laugh out loud truly fool into suppose this be clever satire rather than see it as deceptive portrayal but this film be terminally wound and the joke reveal as pitiful attempt to portray every catholic they be all catholic as mislead through either naivete or stupidity and mire in juvenile cowardice that eventually mature into institution lead with willful blindness and cruelty direct by senile nun with poor eyesight it become clear by the end that the average of approval by critic must be proceed in part from their approval of this religious hate speech the bush administration be genuinely concern with help child as theme for it time in office no child leave behind and consequently it investigate sex abuse in school what it conclude be that student in public school be about one hundred time more likely to be sexually abuse than be student in religious institution and about one hundred less likely to have their assault address as crime that ought to matter you should have be tell someone really ought to have make film about it don you think there may be quite bit of truth in the proposition that girl and boy be mislead by poor religious model but that not crime it just an avoidable tragedy that result too much from religious hatred polarizing and isolate child religious hate speech be crime sexual assault be crime and willful ignorance be on us
boring and forgettable while margot robbie be good harley quinn the character be not give enough arc the plot be predictable and mainstream especially due to lack of strong antagonist the main antagonist play by ewan mcgregor be not develop and hence do not add significant value to the plot story although some of the fight scene be entertain the film as whole be truly forgettable
i wish they go far with it for film depict some of the crazy people and moment in the history of rock and roll it sure do play it safe the dirt be pretty formulaic rock biopic about the notorious motley crue as fan of the band be definitely interested in see their debauchery detail on film while there be some fun to be have enjoy the music and craziness the movie just doesn go far enough in cover their absurd exploit there too much condense into too small of window machine gun kelly be perfectly cast as tommy lee and the rest of the cast be decent wish that the filmmaker put little more effort into realistically showcasing the story of such an infamous band
a lot of good almost as much bad don 39 get me wrong lot of surprise and good writing have come out of this show and even some unexpected surprise nobody could have predict however the big problem be truly believe they make episode much to slow to ever go past 10th season at this rate the girl play summer will be in her 40 39 by the time shoot wrap and justin have already have his time in the sun he 39 a brilliant voice actor but be already handle to much with his new show which be what make seth macfarlane 39 39 family guy 39 crap out from exhaustion predict 2 more good season leave to come before it turn into parody of its former self believe there 39 not enough want and need to make this show like south park which in only its first 2 season have surpass in write quality and quantity which only get well with age believe the best episode have already show or will be quick to pass and from this time on rick and morty will encounter to many problem to stay afloat here in the next few year

that official carrie fisher be joke of an actress the same with mark hamill the good thing good concept nice plot very good sfx though not as good as in 2001 at least in my opinion good score though willams be generally overrate and act of harrison ford and especially alec guiness now the minus 1 the dialogue childish 2 logic when you look at the empire soldier you wonder how be it possible that with bunch of such unskilled stupid and poorly trained idiot it manage to defeat the republic it a mystery lucas could hire stevie wonder or ray charles and at least then would understand why none of them manage to wind any of our hero come on it not that difficult rosie donnel would be bad target they be suppose to be the best soldier in the galaxy believe owk say sth like that 3 and now for the acting mark hamill be just an annoy piece of wood but carrie fisher arrrgh the best part be when alderaan be blow up the reaction of leia be not will kill you you s nooooooooooo no cry no despair it just ahh or sth like that come on lady it not as if darth vader say you can go for date go to your room or no m sorry can give you my car tonight daddy need it your home planet have just be destroyed billion of innocent people die your family be probably there show something curse shout cry spit at his face kill lucas that would be the best idea burn the empire flag as sign of protest but for god sake don act as if somebody have just buy the dress you want now hope that the plan for the remake of casablanca will change as ben and lo should rather try in this one they definitely win hand down and finally can believe it 9 in top250 especially when you see so many incredible movie below empire strike back 15 matrix 33 2001 58 alien 64 blade runner 80 to mention sci fi only but those didn sell so many poster toy sticker etc good watch empire strike back instead 5 10
hear me out hear me out disclaimer ve not see the original so that probably affect how you will perceive the movie it wasn that bad it be charm in weird weird way sure the cat effect be jar sure it be little surreal bit of uncanny valley but once you embrace that it funny it fun it campy the story wasn perfect but honestly have good time watch it there be part that be unsettle to look at very uncomfortable and have me say be this really happen right now and it be oh believe me it be but as long as you don take it seriously it kinda cute like see an animal so ugly it start to look cute it not great no no no no it silly look but would dare say watch it again
don believe the hype have high hope for this movie after the stellar review start roll in but to be perfectly honest this movie be extremely boring one of the only action scene in the movie be the air flip over the car you see in the trailer the other be the awkwardly short climax at the end seriously it over so fast you win believe it really over it felt like the director just want to call it day and be do with this movie ultimately feel really cheat after how amazing bp be in civil war take pas on this one the critic be lie
a great film but 2 great film and one that shall be add to my collection at some point but 2 one user put it very well when they say that the film essential message of the human spirit conquer all be very uplift an everything but sound too much like fortune cookie homily there be several film that deliver the same message just as well if not well jim sheridan in the name of the father spring immediately to mind that film have similar theme to this one wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to term with it but be much good film imo what even more heartening be that it also true like say m not diss the film it be great from what can remember all the performance be nicely judged freeman be excellent but then what new the direction be perfect because it so unobtrusive to the story and the film in general be uplift just think it nothing particularly new and it have be do well maybe my viewpoint be bear out by the fact that it only become huge success on video release give it an 8 to me this fact prove that love the film just not as much as everybody else seem to think this adaptation be on par with the short story which be also excellent honestly can agree with 2 on the top 250 list though be it just an american over reaction to the movie or be every other nation as awestruck by it please feel free to mail me for discussion on this or anything else for that matter 2 of 250 don think it would make it into my top 50 film ah well life all about opinion 8
manages to be both pretentious and uninteresting another reviewer describe this film as sophomoric and would have to concur like the recent screen adaptation of kerouac on the road this movie make excessive behavior of youth look as dreary sad and unappealing as in retrospect they be there very little nuance here figure of the establishment be present as little more than caricature and most of the artsy folk in opposition to them too full of self importance and excess to evoke sympathy the only truly enjoyable aspect of this film for me anyway be dane dehaan performance warrant the three star give up this young actor have sort of incandescent magnetism that command your attention and eclipse everything and everyone else on the screen ben foster be always interesting to watch as well but daniel radcliffe reasonably competent as boy wizard suffers in comparison to these great talent in the central role of ginsburg
meh the first season of this show be pretty decent but quickly decline after season three in my opinion jennifer love hewitt be gorgeous girl but it be super irritating that she be usually half naked e breast always fall out of her top her hair be never do differently when she cut her hair off it sure grow back fast she not that great of an actor she be always cry sob whine scowling and scream realize the show be more somber than most out there but come on all of the episode follow the same general outline 1 ghost show up and scare melinda gordon hewitt 2 she scream and turn into the busy body of grandview and break into someone car home office but never get arrest 3 ghost doesn tell her what it want so she have to figure it out on her own blah blah blah her relationship with her guy friend be little too friendly for married woman seriously cry when her best friend leave to explore other thing when her husband should be her best friend anyway it would have be good as maybe one season show so can believe watch them all the thing that bother me the most be that in season 4 they kill her husband jim however jim do not cross over jim end up steal the dead body of another man because he can not bear to leave melinda ll admit they have me glue to my seat for jim to get his memory back after he steal sam body and have me bawl my eye out when he do guess it because be horrify to lose my own spouse in any case the story really go downhill after that at the start of the fifth season melinda give birth to the baby that she and jim make before he die to which might add she get really pregnant really fast also in the first episode when she have the baby they fast forward five year soap opera much so they can neglect their child instead of neglect their baby also we be to forget that jim be in sam body because his name be jim clancy and we never see sam face again not even on jim id badge at the hospital we never hear sam name except for when aiden be bear and they name him aiden lucas in sam memory as melinda say his concerned family never call or drop by blah blah blah so be he jim or be he sam do sam legally change his name to jim clancy m confuse love hewitt be not convincing as mother she act more like the aunt that spoil her niece and nephew or very loving nanny anyway don expect lot if you decide to watch the show it alright that why give it six out of ten star basically grade of

too simple love pulp fiction and other tarantino movie but this just wasn that fulfil from his other work the action and fighting in this movie be the only thing that this movie be mean for alright movie not focus constant gut on story that much that can make up for clever action be movie like to see sometimes though they don always do good this be no different this be revenge story but since the story isn big and complicate buildup be unnecessary with unnecessary side lore then the action wasn really do good especially terrible scene with bunch of people long fight make it little boring since it have no tense moment and we could see the main character obviously badass why couldn she do cool fresh fight move it be simple copy and paste fight move to continue with that simply shot no cool angle while fight or go around most shot be seriously her do one simple thing and they re about minute each they start go on and it doesn add the sense of cool assassination adventure shouldn have focus on lore too this be simple revenge story and they start to add lore about specific character which make no sense consider she could just beat anyone without even show how she learn the fight move like mario game simple enemy then boss really have nothing else go to it no cool line nothing really cool not completely terrible it have the attitude for the girl completely right just like tarantino good at with the main character go straight to business

pay no mind to the unfounded criticism about this film watch it decide to watch this movie after read very mixed review when film be bash and praise so extremely at the same time it can not help but call one attention and don regret that decission the only way that explain myself why such good movie can have so much bad criticism will be redact at the end of this review first ll go with why enjoy it so much in first instance novelty assure there not many argentinian film surround story settle in latin america colonial era and certainly not many film with poetic narrative for this kind of story if you find film of eliseo subiela andréi tarkovsky or ingmar bergman to your pleasantness you will surely love zama the location be gorgeus the scenography be extremely well make and the performance from the actor be excellent even extra be spot on except just for few one wich at some point aren exactly stand idle in the background now why so many people displease by this film it in the eye of the beholder but sensible reason be that not many people be accustom with this kind of narrative drive them to the boredomness wich be perfectly understeneable because everyone have different preference but there other kind of critic the one that be unfounded most of them come from argentinian viewer and be new to this kind of movie even for argentinian movie that tend to have harsh review from their own country spectators the explanation for this be very simple lucrecia martel express her political point of view about argentina goverment lately follow by massive backlash from let say the more conservative sector of the country so don fear the reaper or the internet troll in this case this movie be worth watch
fetishization detracts from plot this movie disappoint me know that come out of relatively homophobic country it probably wouldn be groundbreaking in that sense but still hop that it would set good standard for lgbtq movie the plot itself be great it follow the plot of fingersmith rather closely except it be set in 1930 korea it have many plot twist and strange character that keep you on your toe the cinematography be also of course beautiful the costume and set be magnificent and appeal it have great soundtrack and also good act so why do give it 6 10 it mostly have to do with the fetishization of lesbian the sex scene be ridiculous they scissor for chrissakes no one do that in real life it be dramatize and obviously pander to male audience it do nothing to further the plot be incredibly disappoint in this scene it be complete waste of 10 minute yes 10 minute it watch like porn the kind make specifically for men to make matter bad the two female character be not very flesh out they meet they have sex now they re in love there be barely any conversation between the two the two lead actress do superb job of portray sexual tension but it be throw in your face early on be gay be not exactly the norm in the 1930 it unlikely that two woman would act so well gay around each other so soon after meet that add to the idea that their relationship be be use for the sex appeal and not for the plot yes this movie be worth watch but don go into it expect an empowering message for lgbtq viewer they could have do lot more with the relationship movie but instead they decide to play it safe throw away an accurate representation of gay relationship suppose the world be not ready for real lesbian movie
it lack jackie chan or sammo hung badly and these word be not from jackie sammo fan the point be that for instance mr jackie chan be able to give us perfect mixture of comedy and drama well not always of course and here the young actor student can deliver neither comedy nor drama at least he can not do it properly but mostly in nauseate even repulsive way auntie be very impressive as the movie start but far on she get more and more manipulative become kind of rag doll who get in corny situation some part of the flick be too prolonged stupid and simply awful like the musketeer masquerade fight it so bad that my urge be to shut the whole cinema down or the serenade dance in front of auntie the chinese actor be pathetic and it be painful to watch this dance singing schlock the story have suck me in to watch this one and the beginning look promising but soon it all turn out to be mediocre kung fu flick of dubious quality the funny moment be very scanty and the fight ton of them here but in vain don feel impressive to me because the director fail to build up the story and the character it very sad that the lead actress be so beautiful and know how to kick some rear fall flat because of poor direction and because her overact colleague student look and sound embarrass besides the main villain character be very underdeveloped what do we know about him apart from want to get the property and have bunch of henchman just 3 out of 10 for this third rate flick from the past the imdb rating here be absolutely mislead to me and these chinese actor ruin my evening when my plan have be to enjoy kung fu cinema of good quality thanks for attention
worth the watch for them acting it be good movie an interesting important and controversial subject that have to be know and give some thought there a really good work from the main actor mcconaughey and leto they re two actor that really give everything even physically to portrait their character and that give lot of weight to the film and credibility to the story didn like so much garner though maybe in contrast with the other two she look wash out more than the acting and with all the respect have for the subject and everyone that can feel affect by it didn think that the movie itself be that great maybe the script lack bit of strength don know what be it but be miss bit of something it just my personal opinion no more than that very good act fair script fair photography worth watch
clever guess but not that enjoyable to watch another cleverly do example of backwards story tell from the pulp fiction school unlike pulp fiction the backwards element get annoy and tiresome fast in this film it certainly be creepy film maybe even affect time will tell since just watch it but didn find it all that enjoyable the end be unsatisfying for me after sit through the previous hour and fifty minute yes find myself watch the clock to count down when it would wrap up suppose could get bit more out of it with repeat watching but don really care enough to bother with that would give this one 5 10 although few of you will probably agree with me so let the flame begin

over rat the shawshank redemption be with out doubt one of the most over rated film of the 90s there have be many intrigue prison movie over the year shawshank be not one of them instead it sentimental slop serve to uplift the soul of the american people there be never any sense in the film that tim robbin character be in true danger if the film want to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of be far more dark instead of inspiration morgan freeman be waste as usual in the role of wisdom spout inmate freeman character be mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all but he be never treat as typical person tim robbins be good but his character be all good while the prison warden be sure evil everything be black and white shawshank have potential to be great but director frank darabant obsession with be frank capra ruin the film at every turn 5
a team be fan of the 80 television series as child naturally be pretty excited 3 or 4 year ago when heard about possible team feature film back then believe the rumoured cast include bruce willis and possibly jim carrey the year go by until about year ago saw picture of the current team cast in empire magazine what no mr outrage be disappoint in the least and my eagerness and enthusiasm for an up dated version of beloved classic jump out the window and die then 2010 role upon us and the trailer for the film hit the internet and cinema but still it didn grab me it look tacky un original well it hollywood and re make so it still kind of be with totally over the top and overblown micheal bay style action sequence and not single trace of any whit or plot visible if it be not for my dad also an avid fan of the show offering to pay for me probably would not have bother see the film well not at the cinema anyway we watch the film last night and have to say it be definitely good than be expect it be actually and surprisingly very good be fear all my fond memory of my favourite character such as a barachus and mad murdoch would be spat on and water down into ironic cliché version of what they originally be instead be treat to clever and accurate modernisation of one of the best v show of the 80 the main concept for team to work be all about successful interpretation of the character if the character aren right the film will fall flat and will only be brand as team by name alone nothing more than cash in on the name fortunetly the character although play by different actor be successfully update and portray and still somehow feel the same as the original with the humour and witty dialogue still there in spade the cast do fine job in their respective role especially south african actor sharlto copley as howl mad murdoch he be hilarious and out of all the cast resemble his 80 counterpart most accurately in his appearance quinton jackson although not quite mr still manage to portray descent portrayal of a and although don recall him say his famous catch phrase more than once he make up for it with his witty tattoo thoroughly enjoy the back story to his fear of fly the action scene as obvious from the trailer be pretty big and impressive which be normal by today standard lot of explosion gun fist fight and airplane chase plenty fill the plot yes there be actually plot in nicely none of the action sequence be draw out too long and although some of the scene suffer bit from little too much cgi shaky cam and quick cut make visibility difficult and bit muddle still doesn take away from the film overall entertainment value the plot be not overly complicate but it be there and it be not completely dumbed down and insult to the viewer intellect perfect balance of action story and humour make team brilliant and successful up date film adaption that successfully bring the team into the new millennium yet doesn tread over the original thankfully the best bit aren show in the trailer and the film be most deserving of at least one more sequel pity the fool who doesn enjoy this film

terrible boring waste of time simply put this have get to be one of the weirder film ve see like an american version of french art film the film build absolutely no momentum at all there be exactly one surprising moment surprising because like with lot of the film the action make no sense yes you can argue that the film be about the dialog and ll admit there be probably some profound insight to be find but what good do insightful dialog make if you re about to fall asleep constantly besides if you argue that the dialog be at the center then there be plenty of scene of graphic nature which do absolutely nothing to further the story in itself as far as the dialog be concern those scene could just as well have be place in coffee shop paul giamatti performance although short be small highlight of the movie even though it also drag on it once again show why this guy stay on the radar all the time for those that be only interested in the movie due to pattison torso there be some material for you his act though be not that good not sure if that because of the script or because of other reason in short if you re keen on watch dialog for 109 minute then this might be for you don expect anything but weird and somewhat pointless action scene though

view on film review of prisoner produce by busy bee actor mark wahlberg and helm by acclaimed canadian director denis villeneuve prisoner be the type of vehicle that be perfect for fall movie go season it be film in georgia which believe be make to look like drab part of pennsylvania take place during thanksgiving and harbor non stop sense of doom and gloom from its open frame think the sun shin maybe once during the entire 2 and half hour run time listen m not go to sugarcoat it for you this picture be long feel long and it really take its time villeneuve use old school film technique and doesn project anything flashy at all the story when it all say and do however be somewhat conventional therefore think it be necessary for the event to be draw out and drag through the muck little base on an initial viewing realize that prisoner would have felt like tv movie and or law and order episode if the running time be trim to say an hour and half thankfully it come off as an extended director cut m not the only critic that felt this way and that to fault be what make the flick work watch it be remind of david fincher film without fincher signature style though and not just because it star staggeringly discipline actor jake gyllenhaal prisoner be basically mild spawn of fincher se7en and zodiac it not quite as effectively creepy as those film but it definitely good enough to recommend part kidnap movie part police detective character study and part fatherly vigilante escapade prisoner tell the story of two family neighbor from across the street who get together on thanksgiving day the birch franklin birch play by terrence howard and nancy birch play by viola davis who barely register here and the dover hugh jackman and maria bello as keller and grace dover have relax calm holiday until their respective daughter wander off and go miss this then get the attention of socially inept area detective mr loki play with vigor by jake gyllenhaal who garner almost complete control over handle the miss person case as day go by and potential suspect who might ve take the child get bounce free jackman angry frustrated character eventually decide to take the law into his own hand as the film slowly creep toward its conclusion you get small twist and turn as well as slightly minimal character revelation you also get to see how important drawing maze be when it come to character motivation ve see all kind of thriller and this plot point be first for me on the act front one thing to notice when view prisoner be how it push aside the other performer in the main cast oscar nominee like viola davis and terrence howard and put its main focus on jackman now m not say that hugh jackman be mediocre actor just don think he have the fiery chop to take on such serious dramatic role his fault lie in the extreme overacting and preening to the audience he seem to be say hey look at me should be nominate for an oscar with all the focus on him the other player roles become seriously underdeveloped it get to the point where you hardly see them anymore use little of no background music there be lot of carefully set up scene in prisoner to fault jackman appear in almost all of them jake gyllenhaal detective loki the only other actor receive top billing take up almost as much of the shared time the difference with gyllenhaal be that he quietly out act his co star his minute on screen be underplay but they feel more genuine more studied gyllenhaal character facial tick like eye blinking be nice touch and generally more effective he seem bear to play his role jackman on the other hand have one persuasive agent he probably need to stick to his strength which be the men movie as fall release that feel as if it a journey or metaphoric expedition prisoner have teaser of an end that may leave viewer hold their hand in the air the over length may also be factor when it come to their varied attention span however find this exercise mildly absorb and it be able to keep me interested you may find the opening ten minute little muddle and weak in term of set up but after that this exercise will place you in its grip not too tightly and not let go like say early prisoner make its case for be serviceable because it rid the wave of other crime drama fill the screen with gloomy overcast and rain drench sequence while watch it you can almost sense that it do hold back just little this film doesn take too many risk and it may not haunt you like it should villeneuve direction be overly careful but hey it still get by though mainly because of say look and gyllenhaal icy magnitude all in all if you like crime thriller that take their time and don try to jerk you around with the camera prisoner might just set you free

a travesty of the original mad max movie will be honest with reader only really watch the first 30 minute of this hollywood blockbuster what do do before settle down to watch it be look at the rating on imdb 8 6 out of 10 this must be great like many other reviewer believe my low rating be reaction to the absolute travesty that many movie be be rat so highly the original mad max movie have young and charismatic unknown australian actor call mel gibson in them they have some plot and believability this have so much money throw at it supposedly around 150 million that the whole world view of mad max be go hundred of vehicle drive around in the desert community of thousand with clearly no problem with water or food even though the baddie turn on the water and let in pour into the sand and then turn it off and tell his people not to become addicted to water word be fail me to describe how badly feel any young people out there read this should watch mad max 1 2 skip the hollywood version thunderdome honestly once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film
ignore the positive review this movie suck hard will keep this brief no significant story to speak of the film just drone on and on with the got ta catch the creature that escape from the suitcase crap that be basically it poor inadequate character development there be just character in the movie we know little to nothing about them or their motivation and care little to nothing about what happen to any of them the essence of the film be look at the weird and charm cgi creature we create can not believe that after all the year of cgi the producer of this movie still believe that effect alone can make movie but apparently they do the cgi be not new or refresh in any way that could see just cgi be sure this movie will get some audience in the first few day just by tap into the harry potter world but it win last word will get out and the currently ridiculously inflate imdb rating will drop like stone take my word on this this be boring and bland failure of movie sleep through about third of it and those moment of unconsciousness be the best part
simply the best zootopia be simply the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation be terrific the acting be mesmerize and the plot be impressively perfect female bunny judy hopps face discrimination from other prejudice and bigoted animal who make fun of her size and could not believe her strong determination to be cop since judy be brainy and have strong will to be successful cop she make deal with sly fox to get what she want when the genius and the yummy bunny judy become policewoman she be so just and confident in deal with other animal and soon she receive all the estimation from all the animal include the previously prejudice animal who underestimate it
critic proof festival hit should be big holiday winner some of my movie friend be stun when mention in thread that this be my people choice award vote for tiff 2018 it win btw generally go for weighty fare so my be win over by pg 13 road film with the familiar they couldn have be more different premise direct by the auteur co responsible for such recent classic as dumb and dumber to and the three stooge elicit virtual double take but couldn help it it really be the best film saw out of 17 and far and away the most entertaining think this be largely because it base on real life story about the beginning of lifelong friendship story that have write participation by the son of one of the real life character there definitely an air of authenticity to the event as they unfold that could never occur with purely contrive plot consider college educate concert pianist of jamaican descent hire temporarily unemployed italian american nightclub bouncer who streetwise but academically dim to drive him to venue in the deep south back in 1962 that not setup that hollywood script write from scratch would ever have come up with the two lead actor really click mahershala ali make nice oscar follow up play the aloof pianist passenger to viggo mortensen b artist driver ali be certain to get another nomination mortensen performance may be little too broad to garner one but he deliver exactly what call for and he make believable italian american which be impressive consider that he danish m allergic to preach and heavy handedness in movie no matter what the message and with the exception of one borderline scene d say that the movie nicely sidestep these proclivity that surface so often in socially conscious film the music and fx be excellent when an actor play piano player there always the challenge of make the playing look believable it doesn get any good than it get here ali piano playing be every bit as convincing as margot robbie ice skate in tonya you never see disconnect between hand and body as he film against variety of background and if could bet on an oscar win right now it would be kris bower for best original score he also supply ali hand which should clinch it top everything off with capra esque christmas eve finale and closing line that send everyone home smiling and it all add up to monster hit its commercial payoff could be huge the movie practically beg for tv series spinoff and the real life character remain friend until they both die in 2013 so congratulation to peter farrelly on his graduation from co direct lowbrow fare to solo direct middlebrow e mass appeal fare you can deny the talent and craftsmanship it take to make mainstream movie that work as well as this one do
really want to like this enjoyed wandavision quite bit and be look to forward to this show since sam and bucky be two of my favorite character however instead of craft series with compelling storyline disney go for white men be evil the series if this be where the mcu be head count me out frankly it insult
a dissenting voice ok it look like m the only person in civilization that hat this movie be at friend house and it be rent for part of the evening entertainment saw it way back in 1985 when it come out and do not then have any particularly hostile feeling toward it but after see it again recently and look through the comment on imdb must conclude that it be the most overrated film ever make quick browse through the comment yield such superlative as fantastically script sci fi comedy the perfect movie package one of the most original idea ever to put on film sic and one of the best movie ever make in the history of film make everyone be entitle to his or her opinion guess plot wise this movie be as sit com formulaic as they come can see how the pitch go to get this film make we ll make an episode of three company meet happy day with some time travel in it must also point out that this film be not science fiction it be fantasy maybe this be my own personal problem but science fiction should make some attempt at plausibility this movie rely on device call the flux capacitor that require gigawatt of power and delorean moving at 88 mile an hour to function although why this be the case and what the device do be never even vaguely delineate the film would have be just as plausible if it involve wizard that zap people back in time with medieval talisman and an incantation that require precise rhythm and pronunciation it might even have be more plausible that way suppose it the science fiction of it that really honk me off it seem that so many people regard this film as good sf and it be not if you want good example of sf look at terry gilliam brazil many people find that film confusing and impenetrable but good sf usually take some work to appreciate because it deal with concept that most people haven think about this film just take formulaic stroll through combination of well worn clichés to be find all over situation comedy and time travel story come to think of it gilliam twelve monkey deal with the time travel concept far good than this film do ok this isn to say the film have no redeem quality it do have some amusing moment as sit com it ok for comedy in science fiction though the fox network show futurama be vastly well

miyazaki masterpiece will admit hesitation in view the late miyazaki film simply because of my own close mind first impression of it historically can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his film but find that prefer the film that center more on character kiki delivery service whisper of the heart as oppose to animal and nature mononoke hime porco rosso therefore after see that this film be more fantasy than reality be not in hurry to see it unfortunately this meant that miss out on have see masterpiece for several month spirit away the story of little girl who must somehow escape from world inhabit by fantastical character be as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it be about the incredible creature that surround her in her new environment while spirit away be fairy tale it be also lesson in accountability strength and responsibility miyazaki be know for create strong young female character that be also completely adorable but spirit away contain some of the most interesting co star have see in recent memory lamp that not only provide guiding light but also happen to hop along on one foot giant baby and bird with the head of an elderly lady be just three of the many eccentric character we experience not only be the character and story line rich but the artistry be absolutely beautiful as well the color and character design be flawless and awe inspire even the cynical and technical viewer find myself say aww and smile at the little soot monster and the mouse the hype be worth it and the oscar be well deserve spirit away be beautiful film that really and truly should be experience and have the potential of be enjoy by most because it have so many layer and imaginative aspect that there will be point of appeal for just about anyone shelly

world make no sense this be desert world where they pump thousand of gallon of water out of giant pipe basically the most inefficient delivery system possible so that the vast majority of it be lose and soak uselessly into the ground this be world where hero get their hand on weapon and fire round into the ground for no apparent reason despite the fact that in such world every single bullet would be immensely valuable it a world with seemingly no food and yet the ability to fee hundred or thousand of people who power everything through muscle this be world where the technology be so limited that they have to use human being on giant hamster wheel for power and yet they be able to determine random people blood type and rig up complicate blood transfusion system this be world where woman fall in love with some random as pasty white guy for absolutely no apparent reason other than that he there towards the end of the movie one of the woman make statement think he wasn crazy anymore despite the fact that no one in that group could have any idea of max history mental state or the scene that have just take place inside his head there be zero reason for her to make that statement and yet she make it the feminist metaphor be so cartoonish that the woman might as well have walk around with sign around their neck read feminist metaphor oh and gasoline diesel be extremely hard to come by in your world hey no problem fuel giant freak truck for no other purpose than to act as mobile stage for an electric guitarist and bunch of drummer you know because in world where resource be rare you ve get all the fuel in the world to do such thing this movie be great so long as you don think it move very fast with lot of explosion and inexplicable visuals so you could conceivably watch the whole thing without ever stop to think about how most of it make no goddamn sense this be indeed what must have happen can think of no other reason how people could watch this and call it smart thing move so fast that you never get to know any of the character in any meaningful way max be the stereotypical psychologically scar loner gibson be able to give that character depth in past movie partly due to his act but also partly due to the fact that the movie stop to breathe long enough at time to get to know him the writing be terrible throw in some feminism doesn change that be completely dumbfound at the enthusiastic response to this mindless stream of dreck
another mystery of modern cinema youth be one of those movie that make you ponder about the miss piece of the puzzle that would make it good film the cast be perfectly choose their performance impeccable and cinematography wonderful lot of scene be like still life painting bring to screen although human be the part of the scenery eventually what be suppose to enhance the atmosphere turn to be the big weak spot the important scene drag on forever and make me cherish the dialogue between the cast youth be not bad movie in itself it simply show what be consider to be good art house movie of today essentially it have lot in common with blockbuster boast with stellar cast and impressive cinematography it lack the action and substitute it with emotional tension between the protagonist and the author where pretentious as if they be pay by the minute of the final product it remain mystery to me how this empty shell of film become an instant classic on imdb and would presumably become cult movie in the time to come
where have all the magic go be scar about future of movie industry and be scar of go to the cinema movie have become so awful boring and unwatchable this one be no exception it a one of many many disastrous movie in last few year there be no mean no message this movie be an empty vessel without the purpose whatsoever so be give two star for fine actor and be be generous
bad movie ever this be horrible version of pride and prejudice it portray the character nothing like the 1995 version or the book for that matter the film make lizzie out to be silly non clever dumb girl who only enjoy laughing and reading book the end of the movie be what kill it for me the godess devine scene be ridiculous and if jane austen be alive m sure she would be disgust by it it change the whole tone of the movie and you go away from the movie miss something don waste your time on the movie either read the book or watch the 1995 version of the film have come across many people who enjoy this version but none of them have actually read the book or scene the 1995 version
face you have nothing to worry about remember first hear about this cautious optimism be among my immediate reaction later catch trailer on that do not think for second that you saw all the good stuff there plenty they didn give away be still not sure what to think then watch it tonight enjoy every single frame no m not kid this work from the very start and never lose you love the show and this pay lot of respect to it at time tad much early on neeson every other line contain the word plan and this not only nail the four character who all get an unforgettable introduction each and several individual heroic moment it doesn merely imitate but build and slightly reinterprets to update them they be play rather well liam look like he be bear with that cigar in his mouth bradley genuinely be charm and suave sharlto from district 9 he revert to his dialect here and there come across as lunatic without that make us dislike him and jackson well he look cool he not ask to do anything he can handle and he certainly get more charisma than any other wrestler on the silver screen or vin diesel the acting be in general marvelous and every role be well cast everybody be bad as in this on off at least and that do get old every now and then biel be largely eye candy as be all other female in this though we know that she can do this kind of thing and she doesn let us down the dialog want to be as clever and full of banter as 2008 iron man and this lead to it try too hard some with that say two third of it work perfectly and it not complete buzz kill when it doesn it be hilarious lot of the time and the half full theater be in all clearly get kick out of it this be two hour of pure fun with non stop awesome action that doesn repeat itself with shoot out chase and fight it not realistic and it not mean to be the plan be brilliant and see them gather material for them be blast this keep to an immensely fast pace without overwhelm us and it fit in plenty of well think out plot that doesn confuse in spite of twist and such that hold up the script be by the guy who do wolverine swordfish and hit man and rookie however maybe because of help from the director who ve only see one other thing by his outstanding the hire short they turn in something magnificent fx be plentiful occasionally overshadow the people be careful carnahan and excellent with few brief poor bit the editing be tight cinematography stylish while it black and white switch off your brain at the door hollywood popcorn flick it doesn claim or attempt to be anything else and it an utterly well make and re watchable one at that there be little strong language and brutality to the violence in this no blood recommend this to fan of the television series who don have impossible to reach expectation and everyone who can get into movie that just entertain you for solid 120 minute 8 10
great effect and an awesome start but degenerate into meaningless mess of hollywood clichés recently come across the story of glass briefly when read tc boyles the harder they come and since this book increase my already big fondness for pioneer or realistic wild west setting be look forward eagerly for new big budget movie that promise to capture the pioneer era atmosphere in grim survival story the movie start out awesome enough kick off with powerful indian vs pioneer battle scene that feature incredibly long action pack shot unlike in the original story the movie be base on glass bring his half indian son along create some father son moment and some tension with the other guy on his trek who be not that fond of savage shortly after we be treat to the high point of the movie the already famous bear scene which be masterfully do and painful to watch for its cruel realism unfortunately from there it be all downhill the whole point of the original story fitzgerald and bridger leave glass behind get water down by the state glass be picture to be in the way it be show in the movie it would have obviously be the only logical thing to do to leave him behind with the indian on the trek tail and his chance of survival be nil rather than create believable dilemma the movie go all over the top in hollywood clichés instead of just leave maim glass behind for dead fitzgerald kill glass es son turn survival story into revenge thriller we be show all kind of bad aspect of fitzgerald character to turn him into the bad guy so we can root for glass kill him at the end at the same time the whole indian side story that be courageous enough to show indian as ruthless attacker and not stick to the noble savage cliché get water down with an unbelievable silly twist when it be reveal that the indian be just search for the chieftain kidnap daughter which we later find out be kidnap by those pesky french who do all kind of badguy indian kill stuff as oppose to our noble pelt hunter who be righteous decent human being with the exception of the traitor fitzgerald the actual survival story then get completely out of hand be so over the top as to remind me of action movie like die hard 2 that do not claim to be realistic and do not take themselves as serious as this movie glass still in state where he can only crawl escape the indian by jump into an ice cold river get thrown down waterfall get on horse fall down cliff of around 100ft etc etc etc at this point the survival story fail to grip me since it be obviously base on comic book physic and realism it get even more ridiculous when glass manage to find the time on his survival ego trip to befriend lone indian who be later kill by the evil evil french but not before heal glass with some indian sweat lodge magic and even to rescue the indian chieftain daughter who be hold prisoner as rape object by the french who again thankfully step in to fill in for the bad guy despite all of this the movie manage to stay pretty enjoyable and never bore until the end which be so horribly predictable that it make me cringe first glass meet up with the rest of the trek look extremely healthy for what he supposedly be through dicaprio could have at least lose some weight for this movie or otherwise they could have use cgi to make him look thinner fitzgerald escape from the camp steal the money from the rest of the crew in the process that baddie bad guy for some reason even though they still have plenty of other men leave only glass and the captain set out as group of two to hunt fitzgerald down when the captain then tell glass some sentimental crap about his wife when they sit down at fire at night he might have just as well put on red star trek shirt because it couldn have be make any more obvious that he would be shoot in the lead up to the inevitable showdown between glass and fitzgerald predictably enough thats exactly what happen to make matter bad we be not only treat to the good old both antagonist lose their weapon so it degenerate into fist fight cliché but then as the predictable fight that try to make up in cruelty what it lack in innovation inevitably end with our hero glass beating fitzgerald and threaten to cut his throat fitzgerald tell him in typical bad guy way that kill him win bring back his son and so glass refuse to kill him be you kid me you just ruin the whole point of turn survival story into revenge trip and lose the last bit of credibility the story have until now but of course we can not let the bad guy get away and so the actual killing be do by the indian who arrive just in time to finish fitzgerald off and stare silently at glass in menace silent indian cliché thing since glass save his daughter life the indian chieftain refrain from kill glass and instead rid off silently without acknowledge or help the wounded glass lie on the ground who save his daughter life make sense the movie fade out with shot of glass star into nothing at least he didn go after the chieftain daughter to make some more indian half breed baby and live happily forever after
a great weekend movie great movie will leave you yearn for sequel and be number four certainly do first off the visuals be astound this really go without say but the final battle in the movie be incredible another sign of great movie my friend and truly like the character we actually care about what happen to them something that can say about other book to movie harry potter wannabes even number six bad as female with nightcrawler like power be lovable finally the storyline be engage and easy to understand yes there be some unexplained portion but this be only the first movie in series understood it just fine without have read the book and there be no point in the movie where felt that thing be move too slowly nor to quickly for that matter would urge you not to take any of the negative review write by middle age men to heart spend the 10 buck and give this movie chance promise you that you ll end up enjoy it
infantile garbage wow this movie really show what hollywood celebrity great marketing machine and money can achieve this be the sad excuse for movie that have have the misfortune of watch in while what childish load of drivel after all the hype it be huge disappointment there be nothing really funny about it the best can say be there be one or two mildly amusing moment and couple of semi decent action scene but for the most part find it more irritating than anything else can see what they be go for but it fell way short of the target it amaze me that this would appeal to the mass at all it be basically an indictment of and an insult to viewer intelligence

a hole in my heart 2004 probably the most pointless and irritating watch since gummo the film have nothing to say or anything entertaining to offer we be assault by stream of unconscious disgust visuals the film be also mindlessly repetitive and just becomes like scratched cd of some cheap erotica moodysson venture into the world of the experimental but instead just insult everyone intelligence art have to say something and if it want to depict the harshness of humanity there should at least be some sort of emotional focus point without the emotion it just three people in room be disgust good watch if you wish to feel empty
who pay these other reviewer 7 5 rating on here think this would turn out to be pretty decent movie what get instead be bore mess zero character development no emotional connection to the main character to make you care what happen to them do yourself favor and find something else
no interest ve heard good thing around this movie so be really excite to watch it in the end honestly didn enjoy it think it because of the gimmick of everything be tell backwards by the first hour be get use to it but can say enjoy this kind of storytelling since the viewer have see the scene that be the result of the next scene it didn keep me interested maybe if the charactets be interesting and felt something for them maybe could overlook it but no the main character be very uninteresting and throughout the film just don care for his revenge story if you want to watch good mystery thriller recommend seven
critic critic need to review what they class as quality movie think the critic have see too many action film and have succumb to the matrix style of film europa be breath of fresh air film with so many layer that one viewing be not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film lars von trier show that old style of film can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension the back projection effect he use during the film arouses and enhance the character and the focus of the conversation they be have other effect he use such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grab attention and enhance the drama and meaning of the scene the commentary be superb and have hypnotic effect again maintain the focus on the central character in the scene and there action could talk about the effect more but think you all would agree they push this film into category of its own and really heighten the drama of the film film to buy if you don own already and one to see if you have not 10 10 don miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film director
masterpiece it be just what you want for the best movie great story great act thrill twist just watch joker in 2019 just have to come back and give dark knight 10 and thanks to heath ledger for the exceptional performs
awesome continuation from the original series this film be one have be want to see for while after be somewhat unimpressed with the new edition of yu gi oh be concern that this movie would not meet up to the expectation of its fan boy be wrong this film retain the magic of the original series despite atem absence for most of it the storyline be novel and engage also enjoy the new gameplay element that the dimension summoning add it be really great to see the original gang back together again with who assume to be the original voice actor the new character be fun and have an interesting back story that only add to the lore of the original series another great change be the animation it be modernise and look very crisp compare to the original series in some place it look odd but that be because don really like the animation that try to make something 2d look 3d it be mainly for the monster when they be summon it also make watch it feel bit disjointed since there be different type of animation be utilise the film come to an excellent climax and do not disappoint just wish it be 15 minute longer so we could see what happen after atem give kaiba that grin
pixar and disney have lose their touch feel with the realese of this film as well as frozen ii that both disney and pixar have lose their touch and the kingdom be no longer magic it just kingdom that collect nothing but tax this movie have promise but the cast story and all around direction be dowb right horrendous and not what d expect from disney or pixar how be toy story 4 so good and this so freaking bad get it together disney
excellent film this film be very real very honest and extremely well cast one doesn have to be catholic to appreciate the story though be teen or old will certainly help sensitive issue be masterfully handle without be preachy or condescend the film length be refresh alternative to the plethora of movie that seem to subscribe to the theory that long be well this be just right just long enough to tell the story but not too long that it become repetitive to everyone involve with this film thank you
would modestly recommend for vendetta be very fun upbeat and entertain it signature flaw be that it want to be subversive bold and thoughtful but it more or less worthless on an intellectual level every point it make be obvious and surprisingly averse to controversy it contradict itself on whether the end should justify the mean it pass itself off as progressive by spend most of its runtime attack right winger in spite of the fact that it seem to be advocate libertarianism it attack cult of personality as the audience revel in s awesomeness d recommend it purely on an entertainment level but find it annoy when people make the film out to be meaningful
outclass thriller bad review be all from drunk people such great slasher movie but felt soo bad when see so many bad review people give so only thats why write this review to tell my honest review to gory thriller cinema lover dont listen these fake crazy people review this movie soo good must watch
more like young schlock holmes very disappointing effort from stephen spielberg while the premise for young sherlock holmes be interest the film fail to live up to its potential it seem like too much time and effort be spend on the special effect and costume rather than on develop characterization and plot the acting be pretty good but find elizabeth death near the end of the film to be over the top and rather pointless overall this movie be good than spielberg always truly horrendous film but definitely not one of his most memorable
good adaptation average movie the problem of for vendetta isn the cast the screenplay or the director it the source material don get me wrong the graphic novel be very good but it work only as graphic novel the story be more from the same another 1984 like england another dictatorship that could be right or leave it the kind of story that work in an 80s comic book and very well but get annoyingly repetitive in modern movie there be very good aspect of course the visual atmosphere be excellent be very charismatic revolutionary win call that hero even though we can see his expression and admit like evey well in the movie than in the graphic novel but these good point don make up to the feeling of dejá vu it seem little too popcorn politics to me and bad of all old popcorn politics and honestly 10 year after read the novel for the first time must say 1984 isn really that amaze
a fun action flick that deliver on exactly what it promise abraham lincoln vampire hunter be exactly what you would expect from the title ridiculous over the top and fun action horror flick the serious tone and silly premise may turn off some people but the serious tone actually work to the film advantage and actually make the movie more fun actually think goofy and comedic tone could ve hurt the film in some way by be bite too tongue and cheek the action scene be well do and incredibly entertain to watch the final action scene be actually worth the price of admission alone also enjoy how they include actual part of lincoln history into the film benjamin walker also surprisingly do good job as lincoln the dialogue be corny but actual think that play as strength to film rather than weakness the 3d effect be also use very well in the film and delivers good mix of depth and gimmicky moment and really enhance the action sequence would highly recommend see the film in 3d if you have the option if have any complaint it would be that do feel like the film drag bit in the middle overall abraham lincoln vampire hunter be fun flick that deliver on exactly what it promise abraham lincoln kick vampire as if you don go in hold the film premise against it than you ll have blast with it
great write act make this superior noir here be modern day film noir if ever saw one you get sleazy character with no moral brutal attitude some interesting photography and story that be not exactly happy one all the ingredient of good noir since the film be 1990 one and not the 40s and 50s in which purist think that the only period for noirs you also get nudity and profanity the best part of the film to me be the fact that the three lead character be so interesting you never know what these intriguing character be go to do next there be an odd mother son relationship too very odd between john cusack and angelica huston who play lilly and roy dillon the third person among this trio of grifter scam artist be play by annette bening who never look prettier or demonstrate her lack of moral good than she do here as the wicked myra langtry you can see all of bening in this movie and mean all huston on the other hand try to look sexy but be too hard look and certainly no competition for bening in age or look but angelica be terrific actress and think her character be easily the most interesting of the three lead cusack meanwhile give an underrated performance one of the best in his career three support guy in here be fantastic pat hingle as bobo justus t walsh as cole and charles napier as gloucester hebbing overall this be wonderful cast that do full justice to this unusual crime story the story have mean edge to it most of the way but that the style of writer jim thompson who be very good crime author who write the novel on which this movie be base he have write several fascinate book donald westlake who write the screenplay be prolific crime story writer there be not lot of action in this film but when it occur it be shock and brutal this movie always entertain me every time view it
gratuitous violence spoil attempt at interest plot that simply doesn work movie be well act with good dialogue and an attempt at good plot but this be what it look like happen halfway through the director decide to turn the movie into nonsensical ultra violence spectacle the plot wind itself up into so many knot that what you be leave with be widespread carnage make this viewer need few drink to get over the pain next day still feel post traumatic movie syndrome feel need to warn everyone away from this movie do not watch this movie it start out pretend to be interesting and just wind up with massive body count for no reason disgust use of good talent
bad action movie but pretty good sci fi movie when first saw this movie it wasn the finish version they hadn even add all of the music yet and think it be much good that way the lousy music just destroy too much of the feeling in the movie apart from the music this movie be pretty good for be big budget movie the background story be well think out and doesn have many hole in it partly thank to the fact that they leave most of the miss piece untouched but the actual story isn that well write it just go along with the standard action movie pattern perhaps that be trick to try to sell it to broader audience but it just drain the substance out of the movie the character in the movie lack any kind of personality which make it uninteresting as an action movie it also make the love story hard to believe m leave without any kind of emotion towards these people and that make it useless as an action movie you need to be able to relate to the character in some way to be worry if they ll survive or not and when trinity tell neo that she love him just though what you have just meet and barely speak to each other besides he a really boring guy it take whole lot to be in love with someone that deeply and it just doesn seem reasonable that she love him and even if that be true why would he automatically love her back that kind of cheap solution just make me sick why not spend few night to figure out reasonable explanation and make the movie believable oh wait we need love story so the girl we can sell the movie to the girl as well the special effect be interest at the time but after while they just bore you the action scenes aren very excite partly due to the fact describe above but also due to the lack of creativity if they would have make the same scene with the knowledge they have today bet they could have make them lot well the acting in this movie be poor but that understandable they be pretty good actor but the character they play have no personality to work with besides they have to care about all the technical stuff as well think it would be hard for any actor to play good with this kind of script in this kind of environment so be the movie any good well the idea of fake world isn new but it develop it bite far and it visualize it in pretty good way so as sci fi film it actually good one but as an action film it below average but d take donnie darko or cube over matrix as sci fi film any day because it good write and more thought provocative and d take commando or the rock over matrix as an action movie any day because they be actually entertain it not bad movie however and it an important part of movie history so if you haven see it you probably should but it no masterpiece that for sure not all movie have to be that anyway
textbook artsploitation technical achievement aside the revenant be pretty hollow and depressing experience lack diversity in tone and exploit unique combination of time period and environment to tell tired revenge narrative the story be too basic to be set against such complex backdrop you ve get colonial politics genocide civil war which wasn even bring up until the third act and yet at the centre the emotional core all there be be just revenge movie no problem with that at all it be problem though when it a matter of kfc be serve on silverware the best this film can provide be to watch poor leo suffer for an hour for the pleasure of people who don want to sit through the oscar when see rape use as cynical attempt at an audience pop know then this be not my kind of film that be say the big pop from the audience be with be when hardy character have his finger cut this be from film feature such highlight as one shot bear maul graphic arrow injury detail and all other type of contemporary award bait finger chop that what do it for people and that be because hardy be the most interesting thing in this hawkish misery character not plot device or motivation but character with layer what luxury it so sad that it usually the little thing mess up during oscar season put the work of so many talented craftsman to waste in short do like the revenant in the cut they choose to release it be passable but consider it ambition so painfully evident on screen passable just isn good enough
move along no story here if you think that movie that deal with nazi atrocity be inherently worthwhile then you might think that this movie be inherently worthwhile if on the other hand you expect movie whether it deal with nazi atrocity or not to actually tell story then d say there a good chance you win find this movie worthwhile what do this movie give us well it give us string of nazi atrocity very realistically depict and it give us what suppose be suppose to be main character but it give us precious little else most of main character screen time be give over to him be act upon by circumstance and by other people but very little of him be pro active himself and even his passivity might be interesting if we know what he be think or feel but we be never give that information we never know what it be that he really want or how he feel say about the fact that his family be ship off to their probable death but he be save by fluke the picture be certainly well make from the stand point of art direction and cinematography but story wise it a shamble as far as m concern roman polanski owes me big time thank you
the bad as awful movie as ve ever see if the hallmark channel have an nc 17 division this be the kind of embarrass dreck they put out make showgirls look like the godfather
primarily for those who own the album guess all pink floyd fan be praise this film because they enjoy watch visualization of their favourite song if have listen to the album first and it would definetely take quite few listening to get into it be sure would have like the movie respect both alan parker work and pink floyd music in general yet find this movie utterly bore in addition the symbolism be too simplistic and the message that get through to me be all too hear before maybe it would have work good if it have be make as unique project from the start maybe then the music would have serve the image because now it seem that the image serve the music it doesn happen the other way around simultaneously wouldn dare comment on music that hasn grow on me but the film as whole tell me very little 3
so much potential but leave me want more have to say as soon as saw the trailer for this love the concept the start be promising and have me examine every single second and be deeply involve im the movie the second and eve of the third act be good but ultimately it be the end that ruin it for me so much information leave out more question arise than answer be give and surely we end up want more but here unfortunately be where it end surely they could have add another half an hour and tie it up nicely at least explain who this organisation be what be on the top and how can they even offer diplomas what power do they have exactly and probably the simple thing be why can the protagonist just go on the platform the next day like the girl do why do he have to die hope for sequel but doubt it

can enjoy the acting without be entice by the story look m 23 year old with no kid or wife the acting by dean be superb the story be actually pretty good and the director do phenomenal job lot of good shot and engross scene but my complaint be couldn connect with it on the level feel should dean definitely try his best and want to be but just felt little less emotional about this film than some of the other viewer also maybe good 10 or 15 min shorter probably would have be good
deadpool be the world most violent and vulgar bug bunny cartoon if you re fan of the deadpool comic think you ll be please with this long awaited film it be the marvel comic faithfully adapt to the big screen just with lot more profanity and nudity few superhero movie be as faithful to the original source material as deadpool be from the chat with the audience through the fourth wall to the cartoon character hijinks director tim miller really nail it and even if you re not fan of the comic this be an entertaining addition to the superhero film genre if you combine the mask with watchman you start to get sense of what to expect it a raunchy comedy mixed with superhero movie yet somehow the two work well together and be unlike anything we ve see on the screen before

movie or doco great lover of spy book movie be look forward to this film while it be well act and daresay relatively close to actual event felt more like be watch well produce documentary on the history channel than be entertain by an engross movie it be worth the admission just but little drawn out in part and not quite up to more memorable film of this genre
bland ineffective an offense to it story tragic true story tell as generic mundane and formulaic as possible alan turing be know as hero to some yet here he be portray like robot wear benedict cumberbatch costume that can shed tear when the screenplay allow for it screenplay that follow an out dated guide on how to make an academy award winning film for such an amazing story fill with inspiration and sadness the filmmaker didn bother to make any other aspect of the film dare inventive or even slightly original almost every part of this production could have pass as movie of the week on some major television network even the soundtrack be bland it as black and white as the over used stock war footage film portray story like this especially it be true story should rip the heart out of it audience have them leave the theater disgust heart broken and angry instead what we get here be film that rush through everything while water it down all to fit family friendly rating and run time of no long than 2 hour this leave the film absolutely ineffective and it audience indifferent and that the bad possible out come of film tell such an important meaningful and provocative true story
well it no battle royale there almost nothing to say about movie like the hunger game it be so worked to death to be successful blockbuster that all of its edge the thing that make film good or bad have disappear it just exist as spectacle finish product that defy any critical lens could go on about the particular of the adaptation the ridiculousness of the entire capital setting or the sometimes disorient shakycam work or the great cast of adult patiently play support character or the source material the gesture at social commentary the way that the story protect katniss from ever have to morally sully herself but they all seem to be beside the point look the movie have the thing that happen in the book but in movie competently shot and act with absolutely no risk take if you like the book or want to learn what this whole hunger game thing be about without have to read the book you ll probably like this it a digestible film even an enjoyable one but in the end it not really interesting or memorable but to be fair it wasn mean to be
bore be try to say something positive about this film but can not it be like body without soul empty blank hollow the acting be probably amaze say probably because one could interpret the wooden performance as be intentional the character be not endear whatsoever and half way through get the feeling this be as good as it get really really disappointed and feel as though this film could have give so much more understand the arthouse greek tragedy side of thing and yes it be interest in the way this be portray but at least inject small amount of life into this zombie of movie
totally avoidable this be one of those movie that the imdb rating trick you into believe be good than it actually be the imdb synopsis also make you believe that you be be take on journey of the struggle of be hold captive into the psyche of the captor of the innocence of childhood of motherly love that triumph you probably imagine some sort of quot life be beautiful quot unfold in room but no be warn this movie be about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stick in room they both manage to escape the room and guess what they continue to be annoy and annoy the character be so completely one dimensional the movie fail to both entertain or be insightful you end up feel stick with the character in this 2 hour long ordeal like someone drag fingernail on chalkboard the quickly make tv documentary after kidnap victim be rescue as in the case of elizabeth smart or amanda berry look like oscar win story in contrast and be actually watchable this movie be plain painful to watch
random joke and baka character funny comedy with lot of random joke and baka character that make me laugh so hard few time the main character put so much energy and passion in his garage band it easy to feel so much sympathy for him despite how stupid the song be on the other hand there an idol play by fumi nikaido who find value in those loser after watch them play in random concert she feel free from her life as an idol after kick the singer from the stage and steal the show these be two character with very different purpose in the world of music that develop wonderful bond throughout the movie the end be bit underwhelming though it have be do too many time before and just didn see the movie go in that direction also felt like naoto takenaka be underused all in all it a fun movie for what be it the humour the band and the important role of kawaii girl be very reminiscent of brass knuckle boys star aoi miyazaki
i don get it don get it how can this movie be rat 8 2 yes the filming and visual effect be stun but the movie be flat out bore the story be old and over play and the entire movie seem like cross between castaway and payback dicaprio character get attack by bear bury alive ride horse off of cliff careen down freeze river and get stab but still survive wow how exciting and to think that he can even be nominate by an academy award be amaze he grunt through the entire film and when he finally could speak he do bad impression of marlin brando in the godfather don waste your money or time lot of time on this movie
smart but nothing else like to start my review by say that don think this be an enjoyable movie which doesn mean it be at all bad think it be very good actually the story be what stand out it very unique and the way it be present be great although it be rather slow throughout for me it be bit boring as it be straight dialogue for two hour but it do all lead to dramatic end which be quite satisfying yet bite confuse most christopher nolan movie be quite confusing though so do expect this when come into it and do understand what happen don feel like be truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it leave me bit baffle the acting be pretty good nothing stand out to me neither do the music use and it wasn that tense but the idea as whole be great and that be pretty much the only reason give this high than five the story wish it be show in different way or just readjust to well suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watch the movie which feel like fall under that category after watch this give this seven for it cleverness alone
corrupt control await further instruction do have much go for it the premise be one of the best for any film see recently pretty bold and creative for low budget there be some really interesting idea the cover be so attention grabbing and it look great so there be lot of promise this be hardly and long way from be film that be doom from the start do await further instruction live up to the potential it have not quite do it waste it no for me await further instruction be one of those difficult to rate and review film due to not be sure what my thought be between like love or dislike hat it if need to choose my opinion would be somewhere in between and be neither extreme it be wildly uneven film but do find myself appreciate what it try to do and the effort that be put into it because await further instruction be not one of those non try film try too hard actually there be good thing for low budget it look pretty good there be great moody atmosphere stylish photography edit that be actually coherent and far from shoe string look production design the haunting moodiness be also present in the music score which didn feel intrusive or obvious find the act good than average on the most part with good performance from sam gittins and david bradley await further instruction start off very well it do have tension and suspense and the mystery element intrigue and compel the direction have assurance generally before lose control bit later on however there be exception to the acting and they be holly weston and neerja naik both try too hard and irritate it be largely to do with the character themselves their character come off bad in film full of indecisive and not always logical character write which make the character not as easy to endear to as need the writing be uneven sometimes think provoking and at other time very corny and rush it be shame that some of the second half didn live up to the standard set by the first the tension suspense and creepiness isn as strong and thing become predictable silly and contrive with some suspend disbelief part and mess of too many idea not explore enough or gel together the end be sadly one that end on whimper than bang and the lack of polish in the effect do stick out like sore thumb sure there have be far worse in film history but it be obvious that the writing and effect weren pay much attention to overall very mixed here but appreciate the effort 5 10 bethany cox
repulsive didn 39 enjoy this movie one bit find this movie to be very boring and absolutely preposterous at time the only reason even give it 3 10 be because it be so bad it actually make me laugh at time the story line lack depth and promote violence the hatred that be exhibit for police officer be somewhat repulsive it be actually painful to watch the actor do good job at portray character but most of the scene be so unnecessary and irrelevant that lose interest in them this movie be an absolute no from me do not waste the hour and 39 minute of your life be actually in awe at the amount of people in the review describe this movie as quot classic quot
decent enough don know if be in rare forgive frame of mind but the hand actually work for me it doesn go very deep in the psychological department and just about every average viewer can spot the twist but then the end just throw everything out the window and leave the audience shout what the but it well act especially by caine who completely earn viewer sympathy writer director oliver stone effortlessly build up suspense and atmosphere and some scene here do work really well technical aspect be surprisingly well handle and make up effect be gruesome and well do while the hand win go down as cinematic masterpiece it a solid thriller nonetheless
overrate crap poor act no script emotionless poor direct don find anything good in this movie sad example of movie which people rate high because other do too so called anchor effect
below expectation despite the spectacular review this film be receive can help myself but feel disappointed about the outcome of this long awaited remake in my opinion jackson be try to hard to make anything just right for the fan he devote over an hour in character development but the character don develop in any way 15 minute would have be enough to make point jackson demand over an hour from the audience to proof that he just isn the right one for the drama department even bad be the film ambition to make totally sure that the giant ape have to be likable and that there be deep relationship between it and watts watch the scene when both have oh so cute fun on frozen lake make me feel treat like an emotional underdeveloped idiot jackson really push too hard to make the story tragic mean everybody know after while that the ape be gentle creature and that it be sad when it have to be shoot but the director almost force the audience into tear that really cheap another point really can comprehend be how bad some of the cinematography be when no special effect be involve be this second unit stuff or why be the fight scene with the native film in this cheap motion track technique these scene look like steal from some odd 90s hong kong action flick however they be destroy the well build tension that lead up to the confrontation with the hilarious ugly bushman unbelievably with all his love and respect for the original jackson have accomplish giant leap back in motion picture history and have make the most expensive movie with man in gorilla suit in it still recommend for its formidable cast and the really nightmarish insect pit sequence
a rather milquetoast yet sweet summer diversion newman be in it this be kind of the typical hollywood trainwreck movie put it another way know of childhood neighbor friend who would love it his taste in tv and movie be different than mine many of the scenario in the movie seem either implausible or outright morally wrong any father know from the 1960 would never let their daughter run around amongst bunch of adult this movie take place at summer retreat for wealthy family and baby jennifer grey be rich doctor daughter she become infatuate with one of the dance instructor entertainer at this retreat despite some objection from her family patrick swayze acting be terrible ditto to jennifer grey in addition to con her father to get abortion money for one of the dancer her doctor father jerry orbach seem very progressive in his attitude for the 1960 another disappointment be that there simply isn a whole lot of dance
euthanasia should be give right for everybody every country that be against that right be farce for democracy you don know jack be long movie but it never feel long in fact it could have be long for me as for that the biographical story be too important and debatable or not logically it a farce that it debatable because everybody should be able to make the decision to end his own life or not and certainly when you be incurably sick and in lot of pain nobody deserve neverending pain nobody deserve to live like plant if they don wish to what jack kevorkian do should be normal without even question like it do in many other country where you can die with dignity again religion and absurd law dictate the american juridical system system with law that be antiquate and that make no sense at all anymore so yes the movie be an important and interesting story it well make with great cast that all contribute to make this movie more than enjoyable al pacino be excellent in this movie in role that we re not use to see him but where he prove he a great actor that can play different character think it be one of his best performance you don know jack be about the courageous doctor jack kevorkian man that didn deserve to be put behind bar not even one day very good emotional movie not easy to watch for everybody certainly not if you saw somebody close rot in pain until his last breath in conclusion wish everybody that be against euthanasia to die in long terrible and painful way see if you like it then
it say lot but not in way that connect travis henderson harry dean stanton walk alone in west texas desert he have be miss for four year leave behind his son to be raise by his brother then he be discover join back with society and must confront his old ghost and regret in order to make it up to his son stanton performance carry this movie far the struggle of his character feel real and when he finally come to grip with this past sin it be very well put together scene unfortunately it a lot of buildup before we get to that scene and don think it quite worth it the first act especially when we have no idea what go on who these character be or what they re all about be agonizingly slow and even though the film pick up the pace somewhat in the second and third act it still very slow which be not demerit in and on itself but there always have to be something to keep up your interest and think that this film fail in that regard not the bad movie by any mean and do see why some people hail it as classic but it be very much not my cup of tea
entertain catwoman be fantasy film about beautiful but shy and awkward woman patience philipps who work as graphic designer for hedare beauty patience be trap in the rat race and seem to have difficulty manage her time but her life will change quite unexpectedly didn watch the film at the cinema don remember whether be put off by bad review or couldn find time to go to the cinema anyway see it on tv list few day ago think why not give it try with negative review be prepare for something awful yet want to check myself whether it be that bad to my great surprise it wasn certainly it be not rich in idea and witty dialog and the plot be far from be original yet the film do well what it be set out to do there be goody and baddie and they do what they be suppose to do they fight the baddie by the way be less disgust than those batman have to fight to put it in nutshell the film have all the ingredient which make marvel story so popular with the audience be keep on the edge of my seat from start to end the urban scenery and special effect be just breathtaking halle berry movement be visual treat the conclusion draw from this experience be that the high your expectation for the film the more likely you re to be disappoint also can understand why people carry high expectation for film which don have any masterpiece pretension
symbolic and very raw watch this movie be hell which suppose be bad and good thing bad because allow myself to sit in front of the screen for 2 hour and relive the pain good because angelina jolie do pretty good job of film this movie be still not quite certain what always bring angelina back to bosnia and her affinity for our people but be glad that she take such an interest in what happen because she be show the world what happen this movie have completely change my opinion of her before watch this movie think this would be more of sappy twist love story between bosnian woman and serb man and the focus would be on them versus the actual event of the war but no what angelina do be much smart than that much more symbolistic and representative of the actual war take plenty of note during the movie because she make it point to use symbolism to show you exactly what be happen in the war she didn need to explicitly tell you the message she be try to highlight you could see them for yourself perhaps the serb pick up on this as well and that why they didn want to show this movie in their country but either way the love story be just as much part of the symbolism as be the actual depiction of the murder rape and torturing of the people the love story be actually not sappy and not hollywood plot of get you to watch the film rather it be mean of small scale the war for the viewer by that mean that she juxtapose the generality of what happen in the war with what happen in their relationship if you tell me that bosnian make this movie it wouldn have surprise me but the mere fact that an american actress do this who hasn live day in the life of bosnian during the war show you how sheer genius her script really be the movie start out with the bosnian muslim woman and the serb man dance enjoy one anothers company together in seemingly carefree and enjoyable environment without warn to them or the viewer their scene together be bomb end their blissful fate together and separate them into the role that the serb army have dictate for them the woman be hand pick along with other woman to become the personal slave of serb soldier at one of their camp while the man be the son of one of the large army leader in the war and force to be on the front line wasn sure if she be try to insinuate that the father of the man be ratko mladic or not their resemblance be uncanny but don think that she mean that as her focus anyways bosnia start out the same way bosnian muslim bosnian serb and bosnian croat live together in relative harmony before the war these ethnic issue that we talk about now be minimal and never enough to come close to even the idea of war this size the abrupt bombing of the harmonious scene between the two protagonist mirror the idea of radovan karadic and radko mladic fire up their army men and their quick destruction of muslim town the film continue show the mass rape of the woman day in and day out by serb soldier watch these scene be so hard that have to stop the film couple of time simply because knew couldn watch them could literally feel my body be affected watch this movie because my heart start to pound for these woman start to shake and couldn breathe as watch what happen to them it not like this be my first time watching film about bosnia ve read heard and see plenty of thing about bosnia to tell you all of the same facts that someone would whose actually live it the major difference though be that haven live it and whenever watch these rape killing and torturing happen just can even function feel numb feel like all of my inside have turn to ice feel like m watch this outside of my body the war in bosnia be actually the first be where sexual crime against woman be legally consider war crime in the hague and international court of law angelina know that and obviously repeatedly want to share that message throughout the movie rape be just another mean of the serb want to control bosnia rap these woman be the serbians way of show power over them show power over the muslim rap these woman be symbolism of rap bosnia of half of their power and sustanenance of their society it doesn matter that maybe the exact character angelina use be fictional her point be that this be what really happen she didn make this just scene in another movie these be the story of woman from bosnia who have survive the war these rape be real and as horrifying as it be for you to watch them these woman have to live with what happen for the rest of their life that think moreso than the actual rape scene be what scar me the most
i enjoy it finally after 3 year saw it and must say really enjoy it the movie start off quite well however it definitely fall flat bit at the end but it entertain and worth watch it have decent length and it well make and it have good plot as for the concept of horror meh it not really horror it have little bit of horror but nothing spectacular and wouldn put it under the category of horror love all the character especially the character of magik anya taylor joy it a shame that we win see these character and their story anymore since it be the closing chapter of the men saga with fox probably all the delay that occur with this movie affect it in one way or another especially because most of the people will expect too much and be disappoint but give it chance and enjoy it for what it be at least it way well than men dark phoenix

underrated movie hi there from 2021 boy it the first time disagree with the imdb rate so much it actually push me to create channel and comment remember put this movie on in the middle of my banderas binge watch not expect much and because of the rate wait for it to go bad any second but to my delight it didn the plot get me involved sarah seem to be surround with truly vicious men so start to suspect each one of be the bad guy but still didn see the final twist come while ponder on the suspect also enjoy the way sexual tension between sarah and tony be picture they click with each other especially it see while compare to original sin another erotic thriller with antonio even though find angelina jolie astonishingly beautiful in that movie didn feel any chemistry between her and antonio at all but here saw genuine passion between him and rebecca de mornay also really like some power move from sarah they be not that common for 90s so they add spice to the picture to sum up recommend to watch this movie if you be in the mood for light mystery blood boil sex scene and esthetic of 90s it interest relax and pleasent for your eye don recommend it if you be into super scary stuff or expect to tempt your intelligence with highly difficult riddle
overly long and quite mediocre the story of cleopatra queen of egypt focus on her relationship with julius caesar and mark antony mediocre but an epic in every sense incredibly long at over 4 hour and overly so too detailed yet miss character depth on the plus side great set and costume consider that this be before cgi the backdrop be amaze interest from an historical perspective and reasonably accurate dialogue be verbose and make the 4 hour seem even longer probably the most interesting thing about the movie be this be where the burton taylor combination on and off the screen start
color me disappoint be look forward to hot fuzz but simon pegg and edgar wright let me down for the first time this be very very weird movie it a hybrid comedy action horror piece and the different element don sit well together somehow pegg and wright shaun of the dead successfully crossed genre but the same experiment doesn work here the action scene seem tack on the horror come out of nowhere and the comedy simply isn strong enough the good laugh be scarce part of the problem be that the film be simply too intense it too loud the cut too rapid the scene be too short oftentimes wright introduces tension and unease in scene for no particular reason this technique work fine on half hour episode of his sitcom space but it get wearisome in feature length film beside it undercut the real deserved tension that develop later another problem be that this movie be distinctly lack feminine touch there be no major female character in fact there be hardly any minor one it very much an overdose of testosterone perhaps space be so good because comedienne jessica stevenson contribute to the script and prevent them from descend into this kind of boy own stupidity don mean to suggest that hot fuzz be terrible the opening scene have get something and nick frost be always at least cute but the jarring shift in tone relative lack of laugh violence and darkness all work together to produce an unsatisfactory result m look forward to see more work from this comedy team but they ll have to beat this effort to keep me interested
disappointed just saw this movie this be first impression the acting be good but the scenario have some flaw there be lot of talk and nice quote for political statement that just didn pack the punch too long too slow and nothing breath taking or jaw dropping be wait for the final cut or the big surprise behind the whole thing and be honestly disappoint in the end the logic of the character be hard to follow and the mix between the action and political drama do not bode well it could of be great action movie or great political thriller not hybrid as for the action it be great nice camera work and good effect but the scenario didn follow

an utterly unimaginative recreation of fact everyone know already wow this be the most boring film of all time moment by moment description of how thing go pear shape for the 3rd reich from the novelty perspective of hitler bunker what hoot anyone who have read anything about ww2 will find nothing new here hitler be cheese off cos the war wasn go too well verdammt russian everywhere time for all true nazi to commit suicide and swear eternal allegiance to the fuhrer etc etc most of the dialog be copy from ian kershaw second volume on hitler 1936 1945 nemesis the only interesting thing about this movie be the thought that have the nazis win the war in the last 3 second and be now live in national socialist state someone might have by now be grant permission to make an honest portrayal of adolf last moment on earth and voilà this would be that film
misunderstood for the wrong reason it pretty genius when you think about how ballsy it be for warner brother to create whole new character of no relation to the dc comic character shame some people just can accept it as as its own thing only catwoman in name like when studio try something new and attempt to appeal to whole new audience that might never pick up comic book in their life for starter there something appeal about halle berry in leather dominatrix outfit jumping on rooftop in the dark urban landscape of salt lake city for me it a action revenge thriller set in the world of beauty product and dark alley with hint of good b score there a bit of social commentary in here about the way woman be treat in the beauty industry at certain age or it could be about woman accept her flaw and become free with herself m not ashamed to admit love catwoman for its runtime of nearly two hour can safely argue want more the film direct by french visual effect supervisor newcomer pitof feel like comic book come to live with its vivid color and wild edit countless time we get insane cg crane shot of the beautiful salt lake city and the dark alley catwoman prowl while unnecessary it make for campy fun consider it be the early 2000s and they didn know how it be gon na fare with audience plenty of people judge its 100 million dollar budget when they forget halle be pay 12 million dollar and they make statue figurine and video game that far add to the budget not to mention the promo they do so there the 100 mil everybody complain about
more fun to be kidnap yourself terrible film not worth the watch be able to see this film before it official release during sneak preview at my cinema try to go online and post review directly after but wasn able to because the film wasn out yet the reason want to get review online asap to warn people to stay away from this film after read some of the positive or semi positive review on this platform must say can imagine we ve see the same film the kidnap saw be badly act terribly write ridiculously edit and weirdly pace respect halle berry quite lot as an actress forget catwoman for her sake but her performance here be uninspired lazy and miss focus the story be as thin as story come and sadly the film doesn make up for it with look suspense or other interesting choice every move be unrealistic every reaction felt fake and every action piece moment felt rushed and be badly execute maybe the bad part of the film be the apparent lack of material the director have to work with every shot linger to long start to soon and end to late give the film slow and bore feel despite the premise of it be an excite suspenseful film the same establish shot be use over and over and over sometimes in reverse to give the illusion of it be new shot and still the film only barely reach the 90min threshold this prove to me that there wasn really complete and round film to make but the director be force to cheat his way to 90mins maybe when you re mother yourself this film will speak to your primal instinct and you ll relate to the story enough to oversee all the crappy stuff this film throw at you but that doesn make this good film it make mother awesome and lovely people see lot of bad film and can enjoy them more often than not but this film only make me frustrated angry and annoyed spare yourself the pain and watch figuratively any other kidnapping film in stead
great effect and act but lack depth in the plot really look forward to this movie the trailer be fascinate with mirror that supposedly have 400 year history of bizarre death of it owner the good thing first the effect be really scary also find the act top notch and very believable by both the adult and the child this be what carry the movie however most of the movie take place in the same house in two time period one be now when the two sibling have grow up the other when the parent be kill the fact that the plot involve few other people than the the two sibling and the parent give it budget like feel also there be several logical inconsistency which wont go into the detail of as it would introduce spoiler suffice it to say that there be several place where would spontaneously say why don you instead these thing make the movie lacking in depth and believability
terrible come into this movie with low expectation m massive fan of the f franchise and have no issue with nonsense dialogue and thin plot as long as it entertain m easy to please but boy this be another level character could not care less about any of them if try the english woman be just awful truly awful kid cudi be just painfully unfunny lead character aaron paul wasn any good definitely not lead man material should stick to geeky best friend roles script just unfunny and so cheesy switch constantly from emotional scene that just don work to action scene that be all bit stale and have be do before kid cudi randomly manage to get hold of all manner of air transport as if pick up newspaper be just lame have to refuel on the go as they be push for time but then spend the next 10 minute drift round small town to scare the english girl make no sense and the killer for me the car be car movie you expect the car to steal the show but we be treat to some american muscle that have be see before the shelby mustang just come over as massive ad for ford motor co and the sound of them be just terrible expect turbo whistle the crackle of anti lag scream engine and the throb of v8 didn get it all the car sound fake not once do anything rev over 5k plenty of tire squeal though if that your thing leave me cold any of the f movie do this so much good even the bad one
meet national minimum wage life be cheap out in the old west unless you re bounty hunter in which case it a profitable way to make living with so many roustabout get up to no good it be inevitable that indio the big and baddest of all would attract the attention of two men with very different motif colonel mortimer lee van cleef and monco eastwood eventually cross path and form tenuous partnership to catch indio who have just be break out of jail by his loyal men and be plan big bank robbery mortimer and monco work together and against each other in order to bring him in and all his men to maximize their reward it a long film but it have enough time to indulge in over the top moment especially like clint and van cleef square up to each other by shoot hat it ridiculous but good some of the widescreen photography be particularly memorable it all grainy gritty stuff but it a rough edge you just don get anymore which be loss to modern movie which all just look too slick ennio morricone also provide wonderful score that utterly timeless and turn many scene into an overblown opera m in the mood for spaghetti now

stylish mindless violence to give tarantino credit kill bill vol 1 like his other movie be well craft stylish and entertaining picture technically speak it be solid on virtually every level unfortunately it be also literal blood bath of fetishized violence on par with the goriest of horror movie normally can handle see limb chop off or geyser of blood stream out of decapitated torso or close up of handgun blast to head but that because usually there be some kind of meaningful reason attach to it in other word accept some degree of violence to tell story sadly tarantino just seem to really like violence for its own sake and kill bill appear to be just another vehicle for his desire to bring carnage to the screen it basically another iteration of from dusk til dawn which have flimsy story construct to justify slaughter of human and vampires the notable difference be that instead of self defense the kill bill protagonist be motivate by pure revenge perhaps if we know what be go on we could really get behind our hero and rationalize all the killing as good but the film tell us nothing we don know why she be involve with her enemy what she have do to earn their hatred or what kind of person she be be she honorable be she modern day samurai or be she just psychopathic killer with penchant for sword if you want blood you ll love this movie if you want some kind of context for violence good story about honor in battle or something with any kind of mean don waste your time check out ghost dog or gladiator instead

twilight with ball do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you re go to enjoy film or not within the first ten minute well it wasn true this time because after the opening sequence be pretty sure be go to hate be number four thankfully be in for pleasant surprise it all start with bad cgi monster and some guy in star trek make up chase people around in the jungle we then cut to some jock do trick on jet ski and some bland blonde girl admire them and think this be go to be terrible then the story pick up and the movie get well from there the story involve couple of character and mystery but be never too complicate after the initial jet ski scene the main character actually turn out to be play quite charmingly by alex pettyfer he support by his mentor protector solid as always timothy olyphant glee dianna agron play number four love interest she come across very natural so that the love story that unfold be actually engage instead of vomit induce like that of that other movie with the whining vampire and the shirtless werewolf of course be number four be by no mean great movie the cgi suck in place and the make up of the bad guy be just awful character be stereotypical thing fall into place way too conveniently and one have the feeling that good junk of the original novel have just be cram together to barely fit into the running time of popcorn movie however think we can all agree that it would be silly to actually expect masterpiece consider the movie premise for what it be be number four be an entertaining little fantasy flick for teenager and undemanding twenty somethings add to that the fact that this movie be neither sequel nor remake that it not base on comic book tv series computer game or toy and it enough to lift be number four head and shoulder above its genre competitor

the return of the rater superhero movie deadpool isn your typical mainstream comic book character he be rude crude violent and not for the kid and this movie encompass everything that have make wade wilson an unforgettable comic book icon deadpool be one part origin story one part love story and whole lot of as kick action it humor be unmatched in this genre and it be my belief that after the movie release you win be able to escape the deadpool grip on popular culture while the film villain be definitely its weak part their be plethora of thing to love in this film so it easy to look past them the highlight be men guest star colossus and negasonic teenage warhead pick solely base on her name deadpool interact with the heroic men be definitely my favorite part and really get you excite for the inevitable sequel deadpool be superhero film we have yet to see grace the big screen and let hope it start new trend of adult orientate superhero film

rogue trip there nothing more patronising than armchair critic like me suggest that if others don like something then they just haven get it but perhaps little preparation be need before take on cosmopolis sure didn think much of it first time around especially give david cronenberg other more accessible work this be not conventional filmmaking so one shouldn expect it to provide the sort of pleasure and answer that conventional film provide on the surface this be movie about hyperwealthy upstart name eric robert pattinson take his limo across new york to get haircut on the way he converse coldly with various associate and adviser as well as his wife elise sarah gadon then there be final showdown with his would be assassin heartbreakingly play by paul giamatti the simple story be the surface upon deep thematic lake really it be about humanity in the modern technological age it pose question about how in world where we ve myriad mean of communicate in virtual realm we struggle to communicate face to face cosmopolis conclude that technology have distance us from each other and by extension our self the film go out of its way to alienate us over 100 minute there isn much in the way of standard plot character come and go without arcs the protagonist be for the most part an apathetic entity but gradually trickle of humanity seeps through it become apparent that eric be return to his past his birth and it inspire him to confront his death the final confrontation be an explosion of emotion make all the more moving by the heartless dialogues that precede it pattinson all beauty and blankness prof to be ideal for the role of the drift satellite at the film centre provide the gravity for cast of orbit philosopher cronenberg write cleverly all verbosity bounce back and forth landing nowhere he film his claustrophobic nightmare in uncomfortable close up first with symmetry and light and later as we draw close to the hidden human be with disorder and darkness cosmopolis be ambitious it unusual it intelligent it art
dazzling and charm knew would like this film but be very pleasantly surprise at how amazing find it as hold out and bit of cranky git confess be one of those who find the 3d experience an annoyance maybe if they someday come up with contraption free no glass way to see it might like it my cinema only have it in 3d drat however the 3d annoy gimmick aside be thrill by the lush beauty of this movie be also gratify by the depth and meaningful quality of the story recount the plot here would not accomplish anything so ll skip it let us say that if the outcome of all the plot point be probably predictable that ok as comedy that be the formula and it be well serve be entrance throughout emily mortimer solid feminine sweetness and likability come through and michael cain be hoot and the skillful comedic actor eddie izzard characterisation be also true to his particular form the cast from the first car film all seem to be here as well to good effect will note that this do not seem like film make for small child at all my auditorium be fill with the little guys cute and amiable crew to be sure but can not imagine that they would find the character and the intricate story intelligible and the jaw droppingly beautiful scenery and artwork would also likely be lose on them love this movie
if this be 20m college film it would have be amaze the film be full of itself it pound the same imagery in to your brain over and over and over again we get it and you re not be clever at all if the movie have be twenty minute long would be applaud it instead we get and rinse and repeat dullard that be painful to watch knew be in trouble when the opening scene beyond the 2001 esque opener be watch motor cycle slowly traverse curve road leave to right no mystery just watch it drive watch all of its journey yes you re establish pace the thing be it never move any faster for the entire film many will shout that it art and deep storytelling metaphor galore eye roll there be nothing that elegant here with all the repetitive message you ll know what go on within the first thirty minute then hope it come to end soon what we have instead be series of highly provocative idea and sub text good for around twenty minute of story tell spread out over two hour in the end pay the sub fee for mister skin to see scarlett naughty bit because that all this flick be worth
a fun film the chemistry of the lead actor and the overall fun mood keep us entertain and the intentional avoidance of some usual formula be plus point but the film never really rise much above that either which have be lead to believe from all the great review and rating
what the meaning of gratuitous really badly write comedy but what do know be no nostradamus
a wonderful movie no spoiler here would like to let everyone know that this be an excellent film enjoy it this week at the mill valley film festival in marin county ca give the outstanding cast and director and my fascination with historical figure have high hope for this film though mixed with certain resignation that might be disappoint there be no way could have imagine how wonderful the king speech would be there be abundant humor without the film ever become comedy drama without dreariness and many deeply move moment can praise this film enough it boost my appreciation of the human capacity to become our best self and rise to meet even the most daunting challenge
please tell me what all the fuss be about after saw this movie rat it 2 out of 10 but after have further think and discussion about it reduce my score to 1 out of 10 why this movie be stupid most of the time it doesn make sense cop car that steal but there no man hunt for it tiger in the bathroom but they re talk about it in the living room like they ve have it happen to them previously meanwhile the nerdy guy be more scared of his fiancé than the tiger the hotel find bed throw on statue but assume it be throw out of window even though they don have window what the hell the tiger be drug and put into their car to take it back to mike place have you lift tiger lately know they be try to be funny but they lose me from the beginning by the time the photo be show at the end be already over it not only that there be absolutely no consequence in the end for any of them booooooorrrriiiinnggg yeah let high five each other amazing that hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard and still make huge dollar in conclusion rent very bad thing now that a vegas movie and if you don get what go on in that movie like one person who call it an evil movie about homicide it a black comedy
from another era man talk about slow burn go into the grifter be expect slick and quick pace con thriller but what get be something much darker and much more absorbing director stephen frears work off script by donald westlake adapt from the jim thompson novel let these character get establish before they start to bring us into the tangle web they be all weave roy dillon john cusack be con man pull small job every day to slowly build up his saving while his girlfriend myra langtry annette bening be do anything she can to get by and his mother lilly anjelica huston be work on long play of her own the tagline of who con who always make me roll my eye but it actually an accurate portrayal here as these three play each other back and forth while the film itself be pull the veil over the audience the grifter be brood noir that throw back lot to the 40s and it hitchcock root include some direct homage that feel appropriate for the story rather than cheap rip offs the film delve into some potentially melodramatic moment at time but frears be able to keep thing in tune with it seethe root as oppose to let thing get too theatrical all three actor be work at top form here cusack be just start to break out and this role should really be consider more among the best of his career huston steal the show in every scene and bening someone ve always despise be seductive and very compelling thought that bening be phone it in bit at first but as more be reveal about the character you realize that she con herself as much as she be everyone else frears craft this one with great tone that the actor play into very well with some powerful sexual undertone and dynamite finale
stop with all these gender switch if you have no idea then you should not be make movie seriously know this come as shock to you hollywood but that be how it work

the downward spiral go to see midnight showing of the movie after get off work my good friend and long time simpson fan who also work with me come along as the movie start notice the goosebump on my arm the hair on my body stand on end and the anticipation in the air love the opening not what expect but please sadly the first scene and maybe the first ten or twenty minute deliver to me and the rest just leave me ask wait the early season writer write this yeah admit it be on of the simpson fan that regularly say to my friend yeah man like the early episode but after awhile they just lose the heart you know episode like secret of successful marriage and one fish two fish blow fish blue fish actually make me relate and feel like wasn just watch cartoon series as common as it be today to hear that or similar statement from fan it couldn be far from the truth the movie be bad easy cheap laugh for the most part hardly any of the witty smart aspect be there at all there be few gag here and there that deliver but never at any time do think it could compare what so ever to the old episodes unbelievably write by most of the writer that work on the movie what annoy and anger me more than anything be the horrible attempted political commentary p as villain and green day of course what love about the simpson be the simpson univerese itself of course there be always guest star from time to time but it always felt like the simpson universe anytown s to me it felt like the episode could be shuffle around and not one would affect the other the writer develop each character so well that it hardly seem like cartoon the good simpson be timeless that the word timeless but horrible current political commentary and greenday appearance make it painfully clear exactly when this movie come out if the political commentary be clever or sharp in any way it might have work instead you have your random cheap laugh family guy like humor that have unfortunately pollute comedy on screen to the point where it rare to find something that actually make your soul giggle and feel like it be worth it like the old simpson season why be burn not the villain can someone please explain this to me it be the simposns movie for god sake the man have one scene sorry know that this be immature and just plain horrible to say be that every fan would want to make the movie his her own way but mon team mr burn up with sideshow bob make us feel like we re in springfield anyways m get off track back to my review what love most about the old episode be in fact the heart and moral quality the movie spend most of its time with bad political humor homer act not quite like himself and bart who we just don recognize on screen bart hat flanders we all know this bart think homer be an idiot but he love him the whole bart flanders story be awful and just painful to watch don even need to address homer try to win marge back because we ve all see it billion time before and this be by far the most predictable unimagined way to tell the classic story that we all love homer make mistake marge be mad at homer homer dosen know what to do homer make everything okay somehow homer get marge back by the way in the scene where homer watch the video marge leave him in the cabin do julie cavner voice sound little off be it just me oh yeah and if homer be mess up where be patty and selma to voice their opinion where be skinner where be poochy kid it felt like stretch out recent episode that wasn quite as bad as other episode but definitely not even remotely worthy of the big screen for christ sake if you re go to make movie that trigger to the new simpson fan at least give us gill poor gill bad movie ever

beneath the eye catch photography and violence and the good acting there lie an empty plot beneath the eye catch photography and violence and the good acting there lie an empty plot to call this film of the year be to ignore that the world be big place and full of film that be lot well this film simply didn live up to the critical acclaim it garner prior to release yes tommy lee jones do good turn as do josh brolin and javier bardem be somewhat unusual the bleak countryside be well film and one of the reason can not forswear multiplex and the violence also grab the viewer attention but even that artifice wear off as the violence simply become monotonous the critic have uncover nuance that separate this film from the classic hollywood blood and gut formula the most notable of which be that the lawman doesn get the bad guy in the end the trouble be that beyond critic count angel on head of pin the coens have retain hackneyed hollywood clichés aplenty the most egregious of which be the psycho who come from nowhere plot device that date back to the devil featuring in mediaeval morality play and be debunk by the time shakespeare be lad hitchcock famously explain why norman bates become psycho and his suspense be all the more masterful as anthony perkins didn look like killer just the mummy boy he really be with hitchcock you know something very bad be go to happen but the suspense lie in not know what by whom or when after the first few minute with bardem character however you know he will do the killing you know how and you know it will be sooner rather than later the only time the evil chigurgh acquire more than one dimension be when people tell him he have screw loose but he just doesn get it otherwise he as predictable as terminator we also have no idea where he learn his rambo or jason bourne trick or how he get to be good inform than the cop and that be just one of many plot hole bardem have act much good before as when he diversify from tongue in cheek macho role year ago in film like carne trémula or segunda piel he successfully mask his native accent but end up sound bit too machine like we can see chigurh be after pot of drug money but just who the hell be he who be the managerial guy who put him in the picture we be leave to guess that woody harrelson be hire man but tell nothing about his background who do the hiring or why and why be woody character stunningly efficient one minute in track down moss while allow chigurh to sneak up on him the next we be also mean to believe that full blown drug war can break out with just lone sheriff on the case without the fed get involved yes there be lot of disbelief to be suspend in see this picture and then there be the foray across the border which be corny and stereotypical to any one who have ever live for while in mexico since when do norteño band dress like mariachi since when do they serenade blood stain gringo vagrant for nothing and in the morning since when do foreigner with bullet wound get admit to hospital no question ask this have as much to do with the real mexico as nacho and chile con carne could the coens find not one mexican adviser ok so maybe this be beside the point that the film be really all about man get too old for his job as the very title suggests but even here the plot be full of hole it be all very well for the sheriff uncle to wistfully say that lot of nasty stuff have always happen on the border but that ignore the fact that drug trafficking entail dangerous mix of grind poverty and instant fortune which have make thing nasty all along the supply and distribution route mexican town once know for little more than grow avocadoes now have sever head roll across dance floor and the country equivalent of david letterman be waste in broad daylight even that hollow and superficial take on drug violence fail to grasp the nettle of century of brutality of slavery and kill indian in make the s what it be and yes it be possible to cover all these base in two hour film will certainly look for them and for answer to all the plot hole should ever read cormac mccarthy original novel for sense of just how disturbingly omnipresent drug fuel violence be and how it end up breed more violence la vírgen de los sicarios do the job far well but with spanish dialogue and be make in colombia it never come to the attention of the critic who heap undeserving praise on the coen brother
no no no don whatch this 1 waste of time 2 horrible soundrack 3 dull boring plain braindead unintresting and repetitive 4 some good look scene
pointless and fill with unsympathetic character critic invent new word to over praise this melodrama set in the world of con artist it try hard to be modern day film noir but have neither the depth nor the range to be consider success john cusack be small time con artist or grifter he have rocky relationship with his big time grifter mother anjelica huston who have take an instant dislike to his floozy girlfriend annette bening bening be also grifter and have be prod cusack to trade in his small time way for more big time con when the woman start war with each other cusack find himself in the middle there be so many thing that do not work in this film it be hard to know where to begin first and foremost would probably be the depiction of the con none of them be especially imaginative or convince that be when we can follow them huston be depict as seasoned con artist and her scam as well as we can follow it be at least semi possible what be not credible be that an old pro like herself would in turn be scamming her bos organize crime in such stupid way that be so easy to uncover give that this development set the action of the latter part of the film in motion we need to believe that huston be capable of this degree of stupidity and it just do not fit right with her icy manipulative character cusack con be neither entertain or especially memorable and bening con basically revolve around her stripping and have sex with anything that move that it we be suppose to believe that beneath her squeaky voice and dumb blond demeanor that she be really smart cookie but her con require no intelligence and basically require her to act like tart end of story for film center on con one would think the film could do good we need some reason to be embroil in these people none of them be especially interesting in themselves huston be all tough bravado as some kind of insidious dark madonna but she be not particularly compelling and never sympathetic when her bos threaten to beat her to death huston odd choice to suddenly give her character stutter to indicate fright seem showy affectation apply by an actress rather than genuine fear experience by someone afraid to die bening never progress her character beyond that of rather dim bimbo who throw hissy fit when she doesn get her way she try to instigate huston death and then try to assassinate her herself base almost solely on the fact that huston indicate her disdain of her date her son her reaction seem just bite out of proportion even within the parameter of film noir where emotion be allow to be bit heighten also the casting of cusack be misfire he come off as such lightweight here he be not convincing as con artist and he never seem match for the woman in the film his romantic pairing with bening elicits no spark act wise or sexually the extended sequence where the fully clothe cusack hungrily chase fully naked bening around the room say naughty thing to her before throw her over his shoulder so that her bare butt get the kind of camera treatment that actresses use to demand for their good side generate more derisive titter than heat additionally some of the latter moment in the film try to exploit some latent incestuous note that be suppose to be present between cusack and huston the problem be that we sense no such thing before the film pull such suggestion out of its butt crack worse when the film explicitly direct us to look for these hint cusack performance still doesn convey them cusack seem completely incapable of generate chemistry with either actress and lack the hard edge require for career con artist the final confrontation in the film do feature moment of unexpected shock violence unfortunately while be momentarily surprise it have no lasting emotional impact on me whatsoever this be probably due to the fact that the character in this melodrama seem more like plot contrivance that be move around at the behest of scene direction than actual living being that interact organically would also be remiss in not note that the final shot in the film of character descend in an elevator seem direct rip off of the final moment from the maltese falcon far good production that this film will never be confuse with
it be decent movie overall the plot do fall into predictability and just fear that the film be little too tense for child that say it be decent and fun film the pace skip along fairly quickly though some part felt tad too rushed and there be some witty part in the script the special effect though be close to outstanding especially the firework display go wrong and the enormous transformer style robot the acting be okay zach galifianakis be the most impressive but bill nighy the great actor he be be give very little to do as the suppose villain it be the voice cast that impress more though with lively turn from particularly sam rockwell penelope cruz and jon favreau nicolas cage be flat out unrecognisable as speckle admit plus the animated character be quite cute on the whole this be decent film 7 10 bethany cox
ineffective parody michael moore and his brand of documentary be an area ripe for parody unfortunately the zucker brother aren the guy to do it their low brow slapstick might have work in the 1980 but thin audience be little too sophisticated for it now as someone who probably disagree with michael moore on nearly everything the reality be that he doesn hate america or the troop he hat certain aspect of our government and disagree with the war in iraq be there anyone at this point who still think that be good idea the comedy be that moore clone be visit by the ghost of general patton and george washington and learn the error of his way how exactly okay this be comedy but even scrooge have to learn the error of his way by see that he be wrong where do malone do so the movie do have some funny moment in it but most of it be repetitive fat joke slapstick and the tired well he only win for documentary joke

cloudy sky over italy though officially base on true story the autobiographical bestseller by france mayes under the tuscan sun play like one of those slick fiction woman picture now call chick flick from the 1950 and 1960 in which beautiful woman usually play by lana turner or jean seberg unlucky in the way of love head to europe in the hope of find true romance in the arm of the heavily accented man of her dream this glossy shallow and superficial soap opera star diane lane as france semi successful writer who discover that her husband be cheat on her with another woman after the divorce in which somehow the husband have manage to finagle almost everything include the house away from her as part of the settlement frances agree to go on gay bus tour through italy that two lesbian friend have set up for her while on stopover in tuscany the usually far from impulsive france decide on the spur of the moment to purchase villa replete with bad plumbing and acres upon acre of olive tree without any discernible source of income to make it all possible france divides her time between make major repair on the place and cavort all over the italian countryside have adventure with the colorful native and immigrant population and fall under the spell of the handsome young italian who always seem to be just wait in the wing in story such as these but be he really the right man for her needle to say with all this go on we don see this author get whole lot of write do during this overseas sojourn though at the end we find that she somehow manage apparently off camera to write whole book about her experience here diane lane be so fine an actress that she be able to make even this hokey pablum almost believable at time for the most part though the film be case of missed opportunity for instance nothing whatsoever be do with the gay tour aspect of the plot one suspect that the film might have be more interesting have france stay on the bus rather than get off as m sure group of gay guy would have know how to have more fun in italy than she do and france own story wind up take back seat to bland romeo and juliet type subplot and whole host of stereotypical minor character every time lane begin to bring some depth and reality to her character the romantic fantasy trapping pile on to overwhelm her apart from lane performance and the eye pop view of the italian landscape under the tuscan sun offer little for the non armchair traveler to feast on

old school zombie cool definitely throw back to the old school of zombie film make the acting direction and dialogue be rather wooden and stilted for the most part as with romeros classic but that say it do give this film the look and feel of the original and thus make it an entertaining way to spend your view afternoon there be some rather irritating moment when the main protagonist whilst run from horde of pursue zombie still find time to stop mid flight to engage in some rather meaningless and throwaway conversation and one liner but not enough to spoil the movie this movie although low budget and with flaw do on the whole entertain albeit in predictable fashion with few surprise if you like the old school feel this movie be worth look and will satisfy your blood lust if you prefer the more high end special effect type of movie it probably not for you

disappointed such great subject but the find be not give hardly any time and what about the famous sutton hoo helmet not mention ok it focus on relationship with the dig as backdrop but still fiennes be badly miscast in my opinion hard to believe in him as ruddy yokel he have far too much intelligence behind his eye would have be good role for sean bean anyway lose interest the last half hour one to forget
brainless this movie start off with an orchestra playing on and on and on so long at least 10 minute that think something be wrong and start to fast forward the thing then when the credit finally roll thought have miss key part of the beginning plot wonder how bacall come to rent an expensively furnished penthouse apartment as sublet turn out there be no detailed explanation she rent an apartment call monroe who have another friend and the 3 get on with their business of find millionaire husband there be no background to their friendship etc it just happen in 1953 when this film be make monroe be 26 bacall be 29 and grable 39 assume you believe the hollywood statistic like another reviewer state bacall have this curiously old persona he use the word ageless one could have believe her old than grable in fact find myself study her face find it hard to believe she be under 30 she also monopolize every scene in bitchy way that no one could possibly find sympathetic or appeal guess this be to show she be the brain of the operation one thing note bacall didn need to insure her rather hefty leg for 1 million like grable supposedly do monroe have some innocent charm and grable be sort of the betty white from golden girl with bacall be the maude may have smile at couple of bacall cynical line but she be too harsh in the movie monroe be sort of funny in the magoo role but most of this movie be not funny at all and you begin to tire of it towards the end wonder how long you be go to have to endure it it also seem chop up the male character become mixed up what be the fashion show all about if you be in to period female costume extravagance this movie will work for you maybe it have to do with the new color cinema scope they be use think clothing in all its color be great way to show off its feature here be an oddity that truly have to be for the wide cinemascope feature all the door in the apartment be double wide and open from nob in the middle trivia don really recommend it the character be not likable at all the plot be idiotic and full of hole humor mostly miss forget all romance and character development which this thing pretend to have brainless the set be almost entirely glossy set ups that prefer to look artistic rather than real avoid

one of those movie that in strange way be almost too good we ve see this story before but then again maybe not this be the attitude that director sidney lumet take as he do with film like 12 angry men and serpico the later also star al pacino with dog day afternoon bank robbery film be staple in cinema since the great train robbery film in 1903 however this story not even say base on true story just say this be true story be enough be set in 1972 and film couple of year later at time when attitude in society be change as be storytelling lumet here could get away with thing he couldn get away with if he try this in the 50 with unapologetically homosexual but truthful be the key character one of them the lead character surprise that add to the unconventionality of the style of the film and an end that will keep you guess lumet do lot of good with this movie and in small way some not so good people would look at many bank robbery picture that would come after this and size them up to this as it be almost transparently influential the attica attica tirade be something child know year before he actually see the film but its the honesty in the truth of the story and problem of the main character and in fact the lead up to the robbery and the unsuccessful robbery have truth out of it it be manipulative in sense as it be so truthful artifice be almost exclude entirely from the picture take when sonny pacino and sal john cazale first whip out their gun in the bank their friend can take it and want out this be great moment and the film have them scatter about in some way these great part and scene make up for the fact that beneath it all be story that we have see too many time the robber face with intense medium attention want plane to take the hostage etc or maybe not maybe one have to put the film into context of the period but scene for another example when sonny talk to his friend on the phone this be one of those moment where pacino be of course as always pacino but also totally immerse in the character and the situation lumet let this play for painfully real result dog day afternoon be one of lumet grittiest successes as he take the city he make most of his film in new york and give it the right tone inside the bank and out for this story of eventuality to unfold the opening montage with an elton john song in the background really have little relevance to the rest of the film except to set up mood and style and it be wonderful style interestingly the rest of the film aside from this opening be without music another touch of the grip realism in way as mention its almost too intense and too spectacular in the power that it have this be al pacino in his prime after all off the heel of serpico and the godfather film with his sonny load with vigor and ambition and delusion of grandeur john cazale sal by the way be equally convince in his own right bring level of sanity to some of sonny over the top idea this film and its actor and character and dede allen editing be almost blue print for how many other film that would come after this would take one almost wonder what the point of all of it but when it make its moment to shine its dynamite
date ambition it very hard to assess peep tom today over 40 year after it release this be because it be fundamentally very modern film but one make without modern skill serial killer movie make when these be mercifully less fashionable than now it deal with its subject with less gore and more sensitivity than most of its modern counterpart the use of hand hold camera shot albeit with explicit narrative justification be similarly modern while the central character voyeurism bring to mind soderbergh debut sex lie and videotape but the set be poor the music ugly the killer motivation unconvincing though in this respect few modern counterpart do well while the acting be completely wooden especially from anna massey as the young woman attract apropos of nothing to the weird guy live upstairs the portrait of the wider social fabric also seem clumsy and quite unrecognisable to contemporary eye although from this juncture it hard to tell to whether to conclude that the world have change or merely our skill in portray it br

some good performance but otherwise very bore this movie just drag on and on and on especially in the last half with the battle scene those scene be incredibly bore roddy mcdowell do very good job as octavian unfortunately through some sort of error he wasn oscar nominate his be the best performance in the movie rex harrison and richard burton be okay as caeser and anthony respectively but elizabeth taylor give an incredibly lifeless portrayal of cleopatra she be probably up every night with richard and be too tire in the morning to put any energy or sex appeal into her performance and if you expect taylor and burton to steam up the screen you ll be incredibly disappointed they probably save that for offscreen another lavish grossly expensive epic that wasn worth it
your heart be free have the courage to follow it simple message but even today over seven hundred year later there be far too many captive to their culture government and institution they take large slice sometimes all of the freedom william wallace and so many others fight for keep up the fight because like the tide those oppressive force wont curtail rouse piece of cinema you can forgive the historical inaccuracy in order for it to tell hugely engage and inspirational story full of hope although it leave you under no illusion of man inhumanity to man and the vile and despicable thing that can be do in the name of greed power and control
more focused on science than anything my feeling mirror much of what nemenemenes say below in his review in term of marooned character felt comparatively little for damon here than do for hank and bullock in castaway and gravity or for the astronaut in apollo 13 the only explanation can think of for this be that absolutely no relationship be establish for damon character prior to the isolation so you have no point of reference for the type of person he be you only know he be smart from technical standpoint the film be amaze huge amount of work and detail go into create the set and verbalize the science which most lay people would assume be accurate but amaze even if fabricate but that seem to be where all the attention go frankly be bore with most of the film one can only listen to someone spout scientific formula for so long before nod off the film finally pick up for me in the final act so to speak but that wasn worth the price of the ticket and don think would have miss anything by watch it in 2d either as didn see lot of 3d effect actually feel bad for not like the movie because of the tremendous amount of effort that go into make it but unless feel something for the character in drama such as this even if it negative m generally leave feeling disappointed

great cinematography but inaccurate story read the book into thin air when it come out and love it it be one of my favorite also like documentary and docudramas this film could have be solid 7 or 8 but sadly be 4 at best this be because it seem inaccurate and agenda driven it be as though they could not show woman in bad light the movie be about two team who be into the commercial venture of take climber to the top of mt everest people routinely die try to make the summit so the fact that some rich people with pseudo expert climb ability pay somebody to take them to the top be dangerous and difficult to respect great shot of the mountain and of nepal there be also compel story behind the tragedy e hideous storm come in make it difficult or impossible to make it down alive the problem be not so much that the movie be inaccurate the problem be the liberty seem so agenda driven spoiler in the movie they don just soft peddle the fact that socialite sandy pittman have to be short rope up by an exhaust shirpa they don mention it at all the short roping be partially possibly mainly responsible for the disaster since say shirpa waste his energy on one person thats what get from the book at least but maybe thats just me news flash to film maker when you mutate the story people notice instead they blame it some texas doctor who delay them and act like jerk it be as though they be afraid to show woman in bad light
trite and melodramtic bad marvel movie since the original men trilogy m not go to waste whole lot of time break down the movie logan there be over one thousand user review on imdb and by now interest in this movie have wan plenty of people have already critique it in detail and add to that few people will stumble upon the page of review that mine end up on and as wordy as be m ironically just post this review to save people time that could be good spent elsewhere so here go my fast review skip to here have you see child of men if you have you ve already see this movie logan be child of men future for mutant if you haven watch child of men instead it not the best but it good than logan as always michael caine patrick stewart do you know what oscar bait be if you do take my word for it this be the best way to describe logan although the idea that anyone involve in logan could be so delusional as to think that this movie would receive consideration would actually be legitimately depress as oppose to the shallow feeling of dreariness it try to create if that be the goal all along then it be genius bravo but honestly nothing against the cast but there be no oscar worthy performance here there be no best write screenplay here and as for the big award do anyone really think this would be the sci fi movie that pull it off if you do not know what oscar bait be google it and read the wiki definition or even good read the one from tv trope http tvtropes org pmwiki pmwiki php main oscarbait oscar bait movie be the kind of movie that think be sad and depressing equal art they try to appeal to the crowd that avoid film that be well like in general for them happy end be cheesy it for the mass it less creative sad ending they believe be brave and smart and edgy and above all more deserving of the word art in reality this be of course complete garbage well write good end take just as much effort to create as bad one logan attempt to go artsy and dark and it felt shallow and clichéd for me the whole story be very lazy way to explain why hugh jackman look too old now and why logan the character be no longer regenerate it isn original or ground break it rip off movie that isn even old as if everyone would have forget that child of men exist which m sure if do some reading would turn out to be not entirely original itself m not about to say that film with sad ending be always like this some of my favorite film of all time have sad ending cuckoo nest aviator midnight cowboy though little uplifting too sometimes artist have story to tell and those story don always end well for everyone involved side note do anyone else but me think that come to america have the happy end of all time even daryl find happiness in the end everyone win anyways so don think that m bias against film that do go dark just want for them to be do well and with honesty so what if comic book be what we read as kid in order to escape how awful reality really be and how rarely the good guy win so what if super hero exist because of how appeal the fantasy they create be and satisfy it be to envision world where justice always prevail and nothing bad ever happen to good and innocent people if you want to go dark and depressing do it just don be lazy about it put little effort into it be sad if you want to just have an engaging and original story to tell maybe they should have do to wolverine what the franchise do to cyclops if you can come up with something clever just kill him off screen instead m try to figure out which death be more disrespectful to the source material and fan of the character m also try to figure out why the men get so many chance after fail more time than not while my punisher get screw up one time and then get banish to the small screen well guess my review end up little long than originally intend sorry m so wordy just don get out much and when do m usually pretty quiet so when get the chance to speak or communicate end up abuse it and never know when to ll attempt to make up for it ll make that fast rant free review now here go skip to here instead logan be oscar bait it be lazy unoriginal garbage that take itself way too seriously

overrate and bore cant believe how highly this film and johnny depp be rat thought that johnnny depp as pirate be about as believable as tom and jerry he mince on to the screen look like young girl who be black up and give false moustache and beard his accent although good than dick van dyke effort in mary poppins be unconvincing and the character be lame effeminate and generally rather laughable this would be great french and saunders material in fact jennifer saunders would probably be more believable than this action scene be rather more convincing sorry switch off it be that tedious
intrigue stalker movie like mystery crime movie where you try to figure out what be go on in never talk to stranger you have constant question about who could be the stalker of rebecca de mornay there be constant tension between her and antonio banderas sexual and mysterious and it a delight to watch think both actor give us perfect performance in this movie read that some people think the end be so obvious well can categorically tell you they be lie not in million year you see the end come would never have guess and unless you saw the movie before or you read spoiler you will never guess either and that what make never talk to stranger special if you like that kind of movie with twist and turn then this one be definitely worth watch

rating this be the type of film from which always expect to receive fun bit of entertainment know that m not go to watch masterpiece but also hope it not waste of my time well the hit man bodyguard isn exactly good movie but it also not major letdown easy to say that the standouts be undoubtedly the performance of ryan reynolds and samuel jackson as film critic there be always some aspect of movie that already know that they re go to be great mean who go into film with rr and slj and expect them to shank their acting fun fact their chemistry be awesome and it carry the whole thing samuel jackson might even have the best line of the script it funny how he play more relaxed and cool guy while reynolds portrays very meticulous and careful type of special bodyguard usually they play the other one role so it somehow interesting to see the relationship between their character evolve ryan reynolds be also hilarious as he have be in his most recent movie honestly they basically play an exaggerated version of their public persona in real life nevertheless their character be surprisingly well develop their backstories be compel and they justify well enough why they follow their respective career path they re mostly show in well edit and captivate flashback that never seem out of place so kudos to you patrick hughes elodie yung amelia roussel prove that she deserve more role in big budget feature because she really great in this one gary oldman be good as the villain but here be where the screenplay start to crumble it yet another cliché villain with no real motivation to do what he do and he doesn even appear in the film that much in addition to this he the main reason why the tone be so unbalanced since it feel completely different movie every time he show up the script quickly jump from buddy cop comedy to someone shoot child off screen still that happen the humor have its ups and down there be some good chuckle here and there but some joke just fall entirely flat when they do work it mainly due to the excellent job of the cast that be able to pull them off the action be fine there be bunch of cool chase scene the one through amsterdam be indeed pretty great but their editing lack quality in some shot can even see the stunt man drive the car but thankfully the sequence be long enough to make me kind of forget those mistake praise elodie yung performance and keep that compliment however she connect to one of my main issue with the protagonist essence both darius and michael be who they be due to the love that they have in their life but once they show how the romance start everything stop make sense it so cliché that it even become unrealistic and it by far the lazy section of the screenplay in the whole film literally it like they bump into each other and fell in love kind of romance follow that train of thought this isn groundbreaking it an action comedy in its raw predictable form fifteen minute into the movie and already know the entire plot so obviously every attempt to elevate the suspense or tension in scene fails miserably also due to extreme foreshadow consequently the first half of the film drag lot and it become bit boring but the action heavy third act partially compensate the previously waste time patrick hughes should have reduce the runtime by 20 25 minute at least all in all the hit man bodyguard doesn disappoint me but it also doesn exceed my expectation ryan reynolds and samuel jackson carry the whole thing either by pull off some fine joke or by perfectly portray some surprisingly well explored character however both the plot and the villain follow every cliché in the book as well as the unrealistic love story that be so important to the main character personality elodie yung be great though the first half of the movie drag too much consequently stretch the runtime too much but it still movie that most audience will fairly enjoy
critically overhyped one of the most obvious example of critic and hollywood overhyping movie simply for the sake of diversity do not deserve any of the praise and seem more suited to be syfy channel netflix tv movie
waste potential take an interesting story somewhat interesting character some very interesting character pile everything up and mix with mud the story could have be tell through so many different lens even by give each person individual account and let us choose but no all we get be bland narrative about something that have the potential to be great movie so many random cut unnecessary scene even basic continuity issue like the landslide or the last scene with the mound untouched except for little dig either that be cheaply produce or poorly direct bonus point for the side story that could have continue as side story but take half of the spotlight

expectedly predictable what start out as revolutionary tv series have turn into just another show when the simpson first start it be funny new and fresh the producer continue along that path until the show reach its 15th or so season and the show lose most of its luster and shine joke be bleed dry and nothing new be add until the producer decide to go the obvious route to make movie of the long running show to try to revive its fanbase long story short it be failure the show rely too heavily on the familiar overused and sometimes not even funny joke but when in doubt the producer have the character throw in phrase quip joke comeback that be either yell involved swearing or both the main reason this movie be bomb because everyone be use to the simpson be 30 minute long since the movie be little less than triple the length it be about an hour too long
a fabulous film that prove the dominant superhero film after all the film lead to this one we be promise the avenger on screen and this film give us that big time this film see group of big personality have to come together and defeat mad man and his army from enslave humanity one of the most important part of the build up to this film be robert downey jnr performance as tony stark iron man and he be just as awesome in this film his character grows in all these film but he be still the narcissist that we love also chris evans as captain america be really important as he be the leader and come across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isn bore which be great for the character the rest of the performance be great as well first of all be the recasting of mark ruffalo as bruce banner hulk and he be the big surprise in this film he be great in both role and the hulk have absolutely never be well then this film chris hemsworth be back as thor and this guy be absolutely seriously movie star and make this character great character full of personality scarlett johansson return as black widow and she be sexy and tough while also prove that she be also the best female in these superhero film around samuel jackson be back as nick fury and he be great as the character and squeeze the most he can out of this great character the one member of the team that isn really develop be hawkeye he isn really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he become great what be important in film like this be have great villain and tom hiddlestone as loki definitely succeed at that he be just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction sometimes simplicity be best for story and this be one of those time it have happen before that group of combustible element have to team up but this film get the most out of it and add real drama to the film the script be the best part of the film and the dialogue between the character be what make this film so enjoyable to watch because it make all the character feel unique and there own personality the style of this film be great the action be all enjoyable and the film look great but have to mention the show stealer that be the incredible hulk this be the best interpretation of the hulk and he look well then ever and he be possibly the best character in the film overall this be one of my favourite film ever and this be comic book fan dream
a movie about old age and young heart walt disney once say that he want to make movie for audience not just kid his goal be to produce animated film equal to live action feature movie that be see and appreciate just like any other movie one can certainly discuss how well the disney studio have take care of this legacy but the company that keep the innovation go for it have obviously be pixar step by step movie by movie the people at pixar have keep outdo themselves to me wall be them cross the final frontier break their own roof and keep go towards the star that wasn just family adventure and it wasn a kid movie it be about two machine and the entire human race movie for audience don you think up be companion piece on the same level it not about the entire human race but it about the entire life of human be this be movie that try to learn very young people little something about very old people in the beginning of the movie we meet carl little toddler with star in his eye dream about go out into the world for adventure come home from newsreel concern his big adventurer hero he pass house where adventurous thing seem to be in full motion thus he meet ellie happy gal with equally grand dream as himself now in any other animated movie this would be our two main character kid on the screen for kid in the theater to relate to but what follow be montage spawn decade and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist it carl alright but now he mr fredricksen cranky old man the movie have just outrun the eight year old by 70 year or so hey little charlie this be your life mr fredricksen it dangerously brilliant our cranky old hero have warm and colorful life behind him but he never get to go out on any of those adventure while there still time and while there certainly nothing well to do carl figure it time for some adventure so he fly away in his house toward south america the land of his dream his only baggage be russell the real kid for the kid in the audience to relate to carl find him obnoxious and even though russell be your average modern eight year old guess the real modern eight year old in the movie house should understand why by now back in the day all carl and ellie knew about south america be that it be america only south russell take gps for grant and say you re go to south america you know most people take plane but you re smart because you ll have all your tv and clock and stuff russell doesn seem to have any pure authentic dream of adventure in him and he certainly not that imaginative but he do like chocolate what follow be an adventure as old fashion as it be fun and original there something very classical about the whole fair an amazing flying machine that have to be repair somehow strange danger in the jungle and giant zeppelin with the inside of luxurious steamboat in sense this be also an adventure movie about adventure movie it part of the adventure to explore jungle discover strange animal and excite secret carl know this when he be eight but now almost eighty it all just nuisance he be totally uninterested in whatever they discover can we keep it russell say no carl keep reply and continue to limp along but it a talk dog russell finally exclaim up also have fairy tale touch to it that be weave into the visual dynamic it feel as if it take inspiration both from the film of miyazaki and from that elegant french style of animation that border to realism the adventure be strange enough to make you fall back into escapism but at the same time it all very close to heart carl fredricksen be as believable as walter matthau or jack lemmon be in grumpy old men up seem to salute these kind of cranky old men too it seem to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog post war dream weave it also seem to be want to tell the kid of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men because be one be not the easy thing in the world another thing the movie seem to be tell us be that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you re at the end of your day we be all child at heart
they re in trouble they re out of trouble and so the film appear to continue in the same vein repeat this pattern every half an hour or so be pretty patient person don need load of action or constant surprise to keep me on the edge of my seat however do appreciate semblance of storyline be tell by friend that the reason didn enjoy this film be because haven read the book but to me this be simply not good enough as an explanation yes we all know that this film be an adaptation of famous book but shouldn the aim of the director then be to draw in new fan as well as bring the book to life for those who have read the book be so disappointed with this don buy into hype but do expect good bit of escapism with this film unfortunately as already mention fail to find anything that could retain my attention and from person who get irritated if people so much as sneeze during film begin conversation with the person sit next to me halfway through the film and continue to do so sporadically whilst simultaneously check the timer on the dvd player wonder when my own ordeal would come to an end honestly can not remember how this end so no chance of spoiler from me suffice to say it doesn matter in my case as have no plan to watch the sequel
film student high school project the only positive thing about this movie that it be speak in persian
bad bad bad can believe the positive review this be one of the bad horror movie that ve ever see it not scary it not interest it not well make it painful to watch
stay gold terrific tweener for kid of any era serious but sweet and refreshingly free of cynicism godfather coppola have real way with family go figure but here he keep the theme and emotion simple one of the reason for this story last power be that it be write by teenager and so accurately reflect kid perspective it would have be very tempt to try and infuse an adaptation with layer to comment on the action and show yourself superior but coppola exercise great restraint and appropriate respect for the material he know it isn profound stuff but he understand that it feel profound to kid who identify with it in walk this tightrope he create rare thing movie that for kid but neither talk down to or indulge them lowe dillon estevez howell macchio garrett swayze only cruise and lane and sofia seem big now than they be here that and the 20 some year since make the outsider all the more poignant

what miss would love to know the production history of this one it feel like it be conceive as jonathan creek or the prestige like story where the plot be enrich by real behind the curtain knowledge of how magic work then get hand around until someone with no knowledge of or interest in magic get hold of it and let their right brain go wild instead of clever insight into how misdirection and trickery could be use for crime we just get magic that can do anything and therefore be very convenient and unsatisfying plot mechanic we step entirely outside of reality and rely on cgi to make prop appear even in suppose stage show fortunately you only have to watch the first 20 minute or so to know that this be not go to satify magic geek or people who enjoy realistic character or coherent plot
who would ve thought see low rating expect cliched trash and predictable animation must admit out of all major animation title since 2000 this piece of art deserve more than just mere movie it deserve franchise don know what people dislike perhaps haven watch enough spy fi mission impossible or whatever but for cartoon think this be enough detail to be both stylish and not to the level of utter redundancy of spy kid the animation the soundtrack huge kudos for fortuna the humor some line be just quote able but most importantly the action think madagascar 3 action be the top of the chart it still may be but out of all the movie this should be 2nd or 3rd for me sure it have lot of cliche and convenience it have lousy plot and end but of all the definition of happy it one thing when the end make you want it not to be happy it totally the opposite when you want it to be exactly like that it may not have enough to be among the top ranked medium the 9 10 but it damn worth an 8 so sad when such masterpiece dust in history while sub par moneymaker get their advertisement pay off
surprise to be honest love sci fi and be happily surprise be expect bad low budget movie instead consider de limitation they have get good cast ok story decent special effect would compare this movie to the tv show fall sky form executive producer steven spielberg be hop they make an australian v show make you on opinion but tink you will enjoy
not worth watch more than quarter of the movie since only watch half this be the bad al pacino movie ve ever see it start with little introduction just some random shot of new york which have no relevance to the plot overall quickly you find out that the character be conduct bank robbery ok sure the reason be reveal later but at the beginning you re look for some kind of sense in the movie and it not to be find once the police come in the movie seem to make even less sense with the police be emasculate by pacino character and surround crowd that support bank robber it just doesn make any sense and it quite hard to believe it be base on true story guess pacino character be crazy at the time of this robbery and that become quite plain yet he not really sympathetic or interesting just crazy and bizarre even when he nice and concern with the hostage his character isn sympathetic because he doesn come off as someone with measure of sanity and until the whole bit about his wife you mind as well think there no reason at all for his rob the bank anyhow ll admit only watch half of the movie but that half be entirely monotonous and waste of an hour of my life don know why people think this movie be so great serpico scarface and others be much good
epic yes it not historically accurate blah blah but it a damn fine piece of filmmaking great script direction performance cinematography and wonderful soundtrack the casting be spot on and though ve see it number of time now still get knot in my stomach before the battle that say something patterson portrayal of the dauphin could have so easily have be clownish but it be ting with menace and work so well he chew up every scene he in this be very good cinema indeed
nowhere as good as the cartoon but still good nevertheless be about 12 year old when first hear about this film and do like it now at 21 year old and look back at it it nowhere as good as the cartoon the film do have its moment and do enjoy some part but overall it just not like the cartoon the only good thing do enjoy be the opening title very well do john debney music which wish be release and some scene involve the inspector gadgets d like to end with movie tip when do film base on cartoon or anything for all that matter don hire director that previously make another flop eg david kellogg the director of cool as ice star vanilla ice
don be fool by the great cast this be very ho hum to say the least jason statham clive owen and the legendary bobby deniro what could possibly go wrong plenty it would seem for starter this lack one main ingredient action it have nowhere near enough of it for my like it actually fairly talky and not much out of the ordinary happens at least it didn for me dig jason statham and he have presence as usual also like cliven owen and love bobby deniro but m really question deniro role choice as of late maybe he need the money or maybe he saw something in the script that didn but in my opinion it wasn a wise decision it also throw in love interest for jason statham in yvonne strahovski but it fail to garner my interest final thought would advise against watch this one nothing really interesting happens despite great cast if you re fan of all 3 work like be d check out something else of theirs

a flashy pretty mess really want to like this movie m big fan of superman and the trailer look great that why it be so disappointing when after an impressive kryptonian set piece and pleasant stroll down memory lane the movie nose dive about an hour in and never pull back up it have good element the costume be great the cgi be beautiful the casting be good and the music be evocative but most of the film good element be showcased in the trailer besides these we get convoluted mess of movie wherein all of the conflict in the entire film derives from an unreasonable and short sight general zod decide that godlike power sound awful and that be invincible be terrible way to insure the survival of his specie if they have to trip out for approximately eight minute in the process of become immortal to avoid this terrible fate survival he decide to wipe out all life on the only life sustain planet in our solar system to make room for easily killable by design kryptonian clone rather than terraforming any vacant planet where nobody would try to stop him and he wouldn have to commit genocide and the script make the point that he do all of this because he the perfect soldier and preserve krypton be the driving goal behind everything he do okay the point where the movie shine be unfortunately front load with some very nice flashback to clark childhood and adolescence that do pretty good job of inform the character he be to become the producer evidently spend bit too much money on their admittedly impressive cgi set piece though and forget to save enough money to invest in tripod as evidence by strange and unnecessary shaky cam in such scene as conversation between boy and his father in truck bed it be little headache inducing and can see the reason behind it but overall this portion of the film be strong unfortunately it doesn last in what feel like about ten minute clark be tell his background and destiny in direct exposition introduce to his love interest give his suit taught to fly and then threaten by the villain of the film whose motivation make no logical sense and whose technology and biology don seem to follow any consistent rule even give the fictional setting solar radiation responsible for super strength and speed can penetrate through their suit but super sens be cause by air their space prison be design to release all the prisoner if it lose an external signal from home their entire specie reproduction relies on single skull keep in one location and protect by the honor system what superman spend few minute establish rapport with the military who be go to comprise every human character except the daily planet staff from this point forward an hour of cgi brawl and drop ship withdrawal follow follow by more cgi brawl eventually climax in long cgi brawl during which about two million people die and at some point during all of this we re told romance develop though near as can tell the only chemistry between the two lead be share trauma and the villain odd decision to force them to spend time together for reason never adequately explain give how much effort and care obviously go into the costume the visual effect and the set it be really kind of shock how little attention be pay to the write haven be this disappoint in movie in long while it could have be great bring to you by ihop sears nikon and the us military there be no real twist or unexpected development in the plot but ve tag this review for spoiler because m little unclear on the rule and don want ruin anyone day
an k movie worship because of it accessibility shawshank redemption have be elevate in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue it be accessible regrettably as be true in so many case popular opinion be an inaccurate gauge of this picture actual quality the reason this film have attain its current level of acclaim be that it be impossible to misinterpret its theme or message impossible to be offend by it impossible to be confuse by however as this review should show it be entirely possible to be unimpressed by shawshank the story of shawshank redemption be something might expect if be be pitch script by middle schoolers the complex coincidental frameup the daring escape the clear cut definition of good and evil the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummate on beautiful shoreline each step more unsurprising than the last each beat more clichxe9d that the last every time the filmmaker feel like build tension or reveal something about the character they take the most obvious road this might be excusable if the road didn also lead to the most obvious destination people also praise the acting in the film while it isn at all bad it hard to be impress when the actor be play such simplistic role stereotype when act well be still bore sincerely hope that over time when the film have settle into history and once people be more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plunder predecessor it will become clear that it offer nothing new and that what it do offer it doesn even offer all that well 1
interest but not great so many people write negative review seem to have miss the very important fact that this be science fiction movie anyone who be an actual sf fan and by this mean reading sf not watch what hollywood pawn off as sf will very quickly pick up on the clue and should have no problem follow the story unfortunately even when you pick up on the clue the story be somewhat lack it feel like one of those story that should have be novella but the author need the money and stretch it into novel without actually add anything to the story run time of 90 minute or less would have be more appropriate than the 108 minute we be present with this be 4 star effort but ve bump it up one star to acknowledge the naked scarjo factor
one mean neo noir 2 minute review this be one mean movie it seduce wrap your arm around you and they gut you and leave you stun direct with striking precision and focus by stephen frears philomena the queen and write by donald westlake one of the literary prince of crime fiction and base off pulp author jim thompson pulpy novel in manner so intricate with detail so hardboiled that it crack under the weight of each step it take one twist of the knife after another it all too good to be true for this neo noir even when martin scorsese produce it then come the actor and my word be they fantastic in their role john cusack be sly yet undeterred in role that be slightly more edgy variation on humphrey bogart with cross of lee marvin to boot annette bening be simply drop dead sexy as the woman who think she know it all yet be timebomb wait to explode the real star of the show be angelica huston in well deserve oscar nominate performance perfectly balance the ruthless desperate act with honest focus motherly concern that doesn feel cliché at all who know modern day sunny los angeles and phoenix can be the backdrop of so seedy neo noir perhaps the best since chinatown frears huston cusack bening westlake cinematographer oliver stapleton and composer elmer bernstein deserve all the praise they can get for create something so seedy yet starkly beautiful in retrospect

start great ruin itself the end literally ruin this whole movie it have so much potential and all can sit here and think be waste my whole night this be depressing and too pc and just terrible in the end
overhyped and bore have such high expectation before watch this movie because of all the hype create around it with all honesty think it keep try too hard make it feel pretentious and it bore the hell out of me the pacing be so off and everything seem so stretched even though it an hour and half long it feel like three the plot doesn lead anywhere and humour be miss no seriously when say humour be miss mean this be the only disney movie that didn make me laugh even once infact do not feel any emotion flow through my body at all except annoyance because whenever it try to make me feel something just couldn stop wishing it would just end already the movie there a lot of great disney movie out there but this be not it
highly recommended act very good throughout cinematography also very good atmosphere great the historical and foreign setting set it apart from the outset and the horror and fantastic element be layer in with skilful hand tension with some genuine scare story great unique the war allegory and the cultural oppression all work very well for me demerits actually none really one of my favourite of the yearoverall highly recommend 9 10
a satisfying conclusion episode vi leave everyone who see it satisfy at how the trilogy end while perhaps not as good as episode the movie do excellent job at finish the story of its central character and portray darth vader in more complicated way this be an good movie and more importantly superb end
fluffy cute well than many other movie of similar fare the fluffy light hallmark kind even though this be netflix original it feel like hallmark film fun premise about medieval knight who transport to current time but it do start to wear thin eventually vanessa hudgens be good actress though and the lead actor be cute
a crowd pleaser as devotee of both the book and the bbc adaptation of p approach this film with certain amount of trepidation but also keep an open mind give the good review of it alas find it to be real disappointment while the story obviously need to be condense in order to fit it into two hour felt that it be so rushed that there be very little plot development and we be allow virtually no time to identify and sympathise with any of the character what really ruin the film for me however be firstly the lack of any subtlety in the story whatsoever secondly the modernisation of part of the dialogue thirdly the whole film have something of mill boon feel to it not austen at all imagine that these aspect be intend to make the film appeal to broader audience and it have undoubtedly do the trick the casting certainly could have be well as well most be adequate at best but what on earth be they think in the case of darcy bingley and wickham appal on all three count fair due however must be give to tom hollander who be brilliant as mr collins and keira knightley who in spite of be too thin and conventionally beautiful for the role of lizzy do actually do very good job and make the character her own not nearly enough to redeem the film in my eye though
waste of time and money this movie be huge disappointment and waste of money and time the joke be stupid and realize that deadpool be not what it be crack up to be too bad as usually love the marvel movie it seem force and the joke actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level more adolescent bathroom style humor the story and plot be also dull and tedious which go along with the dull and tedious joke at time think to walk out but keep hop that there would be redeem aspect as many of the review be positive kept hop this movie be more about money make hype with its non existent story plot and childish humor with no depth huge disappointment

adrenalized yikes the rock be one of my all time favorite suspense thriller believability almost always problem for this sort of film be enhance by very compelling script set and powerful performance by master sean connery and ed harris like good work of fiction it the quality of the telling that make it believable not the likelihood that it might happen there be no problem with the way this story be tell the act editing directing and visuals do not slip at all nick cage in performance which approach his best work add bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture and john spencer tony todd david morse and michael biehn all contribute substantially to an excite fast pace and emotionally drain film any avid movie goer will be hard press to find single actor in this sizable cast who have not either become major star or fine character actor over the last nine year the plot take number of twist and turn along the road so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoiler none of the plot twist be unbelievable if you be willing to accept the basic premise the story begin with ed harris viet nam war hero and field leader who be now general and have become feed up with the abandonment of covert force operative by the us government to get what he want he recruit some of the best officer under his command to take control of and hold alcatraz island hold 70 some odd civilian hostage and aim four missile load with deadly sarin gas directly at the heart of san francisco biehn head an elite navy seal team assign to infiltrate and disable harris capability cage join him as the fbi biochemical specialist assign the task of disarm the warhead and the only man who can get them in to do their respective job be an age british intelligence agent who have be incarcerate for 30 year or so by the government that now need his help connery john mason escape from alcatraz during his incarceration and for all intent and purpose be much rough more real james bond character without the gadget and the comic book super villains all of the above be establish in the first ten minute of the film and the next two hour be wild ride with some very tense moment and some very intense performance m sure lot of people will pick this film apart for the occasional unbelievable scene etc but it worth while to remember as my spouse be always tell me its only movie if you want reality take walk outside or go to work there be no discernible powerful political message in this film while it must be acknowledge that the usa do sometimes treat member of its armed force in an unappreciative and cavalier manner this film do not really drive this point home in the way that for example save private ryan do while it be also true that the us government do occasionally cover up its own illegal activity or soft pedal them with propagandistic white lie these issue be not really the subject of this film this be make abundantly clear by the oddly out of place reference to roswell new mexico the writer either do not want to dignify any perceived political message by bring up real world transgression and cover ups many of which be far more sinister than the secret development of stealth plane this film be pure entertainment and at that work of art treat it as such and you might just have good time with it
harmless and funny heard this movie be hard sell which be probably why end up enjoy it so thoroughly the movie be far from perfect the talented cast be somewhat misdirected but it their talent along with the hilarious circumstance that unfold throughout the film neat 90 min run time which keep the film move and the laughter roll ben stiller and jennifer aniston strike nice contrast as the fated couple unite by hysterical comedy of error philip seymour hoffman be wonderful as stiller pitiful and only friend and confidant and alec baldwin steal every scene in which he appear would love to see him do more comedy be not easily offend by bathroom humor quite the opposite think it funny when pull off right whenever read viewer complain about so call gross out humor or toilet bowl comedy be genuinely confuse when the hell do we get so uptight fart joke and bedroom humor have comprise some of the funny scene ever film jeff daniel in dumb dumber or chris tucker in friday for example d recommend this harmless and enjoyable movie to my mother toilet humor and all
atrocious from begin to end spoiler this review contain spoilersall quality of the book be sacrifice for the sake of an action film full of cheap plot device gratuitous and often illogical story change and poor characterization the scenery be actually great if the camera would ever stop whirl around long enough to allow it to be enjoy appreciate sweeping camera move judiciously use to set off dramatic vista but that device be do to death the action scene be such blitz of brief incoherent cut that they be hard to watch the lighting be frequently peculiar for example everyone in rivendell look waxy and sallow then there be the music be afraid the composer have watch conan the barbarian few two many time operatic choir music bad guy every time you see them yuk those be just the minor flaw in this piece of trash the endless action cliche and cheap device leave me groan at such ham hand treatment of tolkien from the sacrifice of sam merry and pippin character for the sake of comedy to the crumble staircase in moria to the silly wizard battle between gandalf and saruman complete with the dive off the tower only to be catch by the eagle ploy all of this be invent by peter jackson as if the book do not provide enough exciting event to draw upon it be long book and clearly cut have to be make for manageable movie but to expend precious minute on protracted combat and repetitious detail of isengard while leave out important story and character development be truly sad in fact jackson go so far as to drag material belonging to the two tower the shortest of the three book into this movie which be the long of the three book many of these change do nothing for the story sometimes even weaken it in the book saruman be in it for himself believe himself to be the one person who could stand up to sauron if only he have the ring his view of thing have be warp by sauron subtle control of what he see through the palantir this be much more interesting than saruman as the avowed lackey of sauron the former case make sense of the treatment saruman get at the end of the two tower while the later do not the combat and action should have be brief intense and significant in the book none of the combat with boromir defend merry and pippin be see just the tragic result the battle in balin tomb take up 1 page out of 400 it be short fierce and to the point the incident of frodo turn out to be okay after be spear be actually rather funny in the book in the movie this be blow so far out of proportion think would gag it be turn into the bad of manipulative character be kill oh no they be okay scene and for those long minute and many others like them they sacrifice the barrow down frodo cow jump over the moon table dance the hobbit actually get to know and trust strider on the way to rivendell the bad part be the butchery of the character legolas lose his light hearted singing nature gimli be caricature from bad d game replete with irish brogue absent be their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship one of the hallmark of the book hobbit go from the stealthy nimble people of the book to bumble comic relief in the book sam be clever love all thing elven know old ballad in the movie he be just dumb and loyal in the movie merry and pippin be turn into witless juvenile troublemaker suck into the quest willy nilly instead of dedicated friend conspire with sam to go on the quest to support frodo and frodo own strong moment when he defy the nazgul at the river be take away leave him just helpless victim drag along and finally back to that end battle where be aragorn poignant agony watch the fellowship fall apart under his leadership and his tortured choice over which way to go he doesn have to make it because the movie add scene between frodo and him settle the matter then there be the bad guy we can start with sauron in the beginning he look like some sort of battle droid transformer monster what be that he be wizard and in the history of middle earth be most famous for his guile and lie not be walk tank the orcs of course they be suppose to be scary and nasty but they be in fact people it be clear throughout the book that they be more than beast much of the beginning of the two tower hinge on their own politics and personality as do the event in cirith ungol in the return of the king but what we see in the movie be almost zombie who hiss and growl and grunt word or two the big problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film be the complete lack of subtlety or mystery it all show in full special effect glory rather than hint at as in the book have be frighten at movie plenty of time be ever frighten during this one never in fact that be the big flaw in all of this peter jackson have no sense of subtlety everything be explicit and obvious and the viewer be club over the head with it the movie be inform less by the book than by the stereotype ridden game genre that come out of it if the movie saw be in turn novelize the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten couple of year after publication
a haunting atmosphere his film remind me of the big sleep with bogie and bacall although chinatown be more enjoyable than the 1946 so call classic both jake gittes and philip marlowe exude smugness and insolence both have to contend with and be inexorably draw to classy woman with secret and typical of movie that feature gumshoe detectives the story of both the big sleep and chinatown be confuse and convolute chinatown combine power and corruption with sex and murder into needlessly complex plot write perhaps deliberately to confound viewer in keep with traditional noir doctrine which espouse that confusion equal arty sophistication so who do kill ida session and how do she get possession of those picture fan of chinatown would regard such question as irrelevant just as fan of the big sleep would regard the question of who kill owen taylor irrelevant who care who the killer be so long as you have the infallible nicholson as heir to the infallible bogart to distract attention from the story sorry but just don agree that muddle story can be film virtue chinatown do have its strength good act permeate the film even among minor character but the performance of john huston be inspire pardon the irony and should have be recognize as such with an academy award the music too be impressive the slow lonely horn evokes dark and brood mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography this film have haunt cinematic atmosphere and to some extent that help overcome perplexing plot

this be how movie should be make this movie be not your ordinary hollywood flick it have great and deep message this movie have foundation and just keep on be build on from their and that foundation be hope other than just the message of this movie the acting be phenomenal tim robbins give one of the great performance ever he be inspire intelligent and most of all positive his performance just make me smile robbins play andy dufresne who be wrongfully convict of murder his wife and her lover he be get to life sentence but yet never give up hope in he become friend with ellis boyd red redding play by morgan freeman freeman who give the fine performance of his career have unlike robbins lose hope he be in deep regret of the crime that he commit his way of deflect the pain away be by try to not feel anything at all with his friendship with andy he learn that without our hope and dream we have nothing andy also become friend with the rest of red group james whitmore also give great performance as brook halten who get out of prison parole but in the word of red he have be institutionalize the directing by frank darabont be just magnificent he keep this movie at great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography he portray prison life in such horrifying way but not in term of the physical pain but the stress and pain that war mentally on the inmate some of which deserve second chance whatever you do don listen to the people who say this movie be overrate because this be one of the most inspiring and great movie ever it have everything you could possibly want 10
no point the movie be incredibly well produce and incredibly well film however there be little point yes they want to get ring somewhere but it do not take such long time to deal with this matter rather the movie would be good off split into serial air once week on tv there be little character development and no substantial development of plot instead there be merely series of excite and well filmed adventure if have oodles of time to devote to be entertain such as when retire one day then would maybe have enjoy this movie more
silly and predictable but plenty of fun ever since the popularity of video game skyrocket in the 1980s hollywood have be try to cash in on the craze by bring well know franchise to the big screen while some adaptation have come close to get it right silent hill be probably the best most video game movie have be absolutely terrible with super mario bros and street fighter the movie serving as shin example of what not to do with well documented history of failed project the expectation surround need for speed couldn be much low after all it base on decade old franchise about illegal street race feature young cast that remain unproven at the box office but what the film lack in storytelling and character development be more than compensate for thanks to the action behind the wheel two year after be frame for the death of friend tobey marshall aaron paul be release from prison with revenge on his mind his target be dino brewster dominic cooper the shady professional racer that put tobey in jail and tobey friend in coffin take down dino will mean beat him at his own game top secret race feature the world most elite driver and host by the mysterious monarch michael keaton with less than two day to get from new york to california before the race begin tobey embarks on cross country trek that feature plenty of jaw drop moment make even more thrilling by director scott waugh insistence that all driving stunt be perform by real driver in real car this add an extra layer of tension that sorely miss from the fast and furious series to which need for speed be destine to be compare and the film best moment come courtesy of brake drift squeal tire and near collision despite its paper thin plot and many many fail attempt at humor need for speed still work thanks to the generous amount of high octane action sequence and the undeniable charisma of aaron paul skeptic may not have believe that paul could distance himself from his jesse pinkman persona but he deliver strong performance that should put him on the radar for future action role need for speed be one of the good attempt at translate popular video game into big screen experience with the practical stunt and real world action serve as nice counterbalance to fast and furious ever increase ridiculousness its silliness predictability and over inflated running time keep it from be truly great movie but it still hell of lot of fun
not perfect but original in its idea the way it develop grow and its representation of satire be just beautiful so out there right on the screen yet not for everyone to understand and this be why perhaps some people be really harsh about it don know if it suppose to be horror production perhaps some element here and there but mostly way to talk to the people some listen some didn now as many complain too also find the end to be bland mean after few leave right twist here and there out of nowhere we be prepared for this ultimate climax battle like none before finally someone take action and not lay down anymore but last only few level and then return to more platonic experience really don understand how they let it end like so think there be room for more and for really pleasant and satisfying conclusion overall like many spanish thriller el hoyo be great delight really not perfect all the way but hey ll take such leftover anytime and not complain about it it be different and it be different good cheer
if you run out of blockbuster check it out action pack film dedicate to the original tv series with the same name interest at first because of its cast bradley cooper liam neeson sharlito copley and because of the very fast pace right from the beginning of the film the action sequence be messy but deliver entertainment throughout the movie and that overrun the sometimes flaw script and the plot hole act be ok the performance of sharlito copley be hilarious he be spice up the boring in between conversation of the character and the thing he say or do be very funny overall entertaining blockbuster which still stand its ground 7 10
omg ll never get that time back 1 star because couldn give it less crap film crap end cheap cgi use line from fast and furious poor really poor
the emperor have no clothes the cgi face create soulless effect it never feel like real film just digital recreation where computerized character be pretend to be deniro pacino and pesci they basically rob us of the reunion by experiment with technique that fail so badly we know never to do that the tragedy be this be not time to experiment they hang the entire picture on the believability of the de aging and it doesn work for second it egregious bizarre and will age horribly for the simple reason it not register as acting because computer programmer be do the act via mouseclicks for marty purest of cinema to have this little respect for the purity of performance mark this as hypocrisy how he trash blockbuster film this be the theme park ride this be great hit tour through his oeuvre this be uncanny directorial valley m certain in 2050 you would get these old actor recreate exactly like this that be our soulless future why rush to it and the sad thing be the cast be all there and we will never get to see what they do clearly everyone be in denial and review scorsese other work and pretend the emperor wardrobe be just wonderful when critic talk about the last half hour be conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic well sure because they finally show him act and it not just that the cgi sink the film it that it call the entire thing into question and demand every other area perfect to make up for it and can you honestly say the script and story be match the perception of these rave review
good than average cop film although this be great eye candy and good than average cop film it be not very realistic cop film spacey be good and jackson be very good too good there be no such cop and even if there be they would never get out of this situation alive much less on top get over on corrupt cop gang might be an extreme long shot but get over on corrupt cop gang and internal affair no way no how give credit to the director for maintain good pace and suspense and set up good shot on film but the writer be fall little short in the reality area maybe if they have stick to one or the other the corrupt gang or internal affair they might have make it believable but not the way it supposedly unfold on the screen
overrate absolutely not classic after see this movie could not notice to be mislead by the imdb rating the movie be nice even good but no way it should receive 9 0 the movie could easily have be produce by disney strong moral happy end sure there be strong point the scene of the old man who have be imprison for almost his whole life be very well place and tim robbins performance be good but the story itself do not leave anything behind 3 out of 5 that all there be to it 4
oscar win movie la la land be one of my favorite movie of all time there be sing out of this world romance there be loss there be sadness and then real life romance the last scene be haunt and spoiler alert the couple do not end up together which always make for the best love story in the last scene when ryan gosling be on the piano and emma stone be watch quietly with her husband the theater be really pin drop silence and be scream oscar in my head
an emotional monotony the idea and plot have twist in it but the way movie have be shot total emotional monotony just make me want to sleep or remotely slap character so he she wake up if this movie wouldn feature nicole kidman probably would think that role be play by total talentless random people sorry but movie be waste of time
mediocre would be too generous far from tom cruise best and be pretty big tom cruise fan oblivion have very good beginning always like good shoot em ups but it really tank when the plot get all twist around itself and strangle all logic and morgan freeman why be he in this anyway what pointless and waste part if they have work little more on his character development it may have save the movie nah just kid there be no save this flick this re hash of the same old story of the bad guy be really the good guy and the good guy be the bad guy total recall come to mind have be do so many time before it end up be bore the cast be great but the writing sheesh this be something with good possibility that end up with juvenile plot that unravel to the point where some convolute end have be toss in don get me wrong it be not all hogwash if one enjoy action scene and pretty scenery and you be not really into storyline then this be for you and can understand where the very young would probably eat this kind of fantasy up with their morning flake well yippee for them oh and those youngster may even think something like wow wee this be really good sci fi it isn i feel this be mediocre sci fi with an excellent cast whatever they do hope they do not choose to re clone this mess
cheese fest read the book and if didn i wouldn have know what be go on in this mess of film it all over the place bounce from story line to story line with no cohesion cringe worthy act actor look nothing like the real guy and the wig be atrocious who be this suppose to appeal to
welcome to the black rambo fairly solid action scene character and overall execution somehow the filmmaker and actor make this very hard to believe film enjoyable this be definitely sensationalistic film the most sensationalistic of washington career without doubt and it mostly regurgitate cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well but it do manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time even though it have run time of over two hour the film do feel overall as though it be miss few key scene but nonetheless it still worth look if you re into these kind of film the movie didn remind me much at all of the old v series of the same name the film be much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tale that charles broson use to do all that say this basically chalk up as good film to watch when you don want to think much and you just want to watch lot of kick as entertain violence it that kind of guilty pleasure 6 5 10

no fun for non fan as someone who have not read marvel comic have not see the film captain america the hulk thor or iron man ii this film fail to pull me in as standalone movie the avenger feel like mishmash of rapid surface level character introduction and way too much action little attention be give to character development as it seem viewer be expect to come into the film with degree of knowledge however this be not to say that think the film would be great if do have some knowledge of the backstory there little in the way of moral here or deep meaning as this be just good guy save world plot it one that like many superhero movie before make me ask if character development or thought for that matter really be be extinguish by money drive action wouldn even call this popcorn movie as find few laugh and absolutely no connection to the character in my experience like action movie but need to be draw in to the character in order to care about the action the avenger didn even try to draw me in it just say here be the hero now watch them fight if the first hour have establish some human element for the hero might have like the action as it stand the audience be throw into the arena with the invincible combatant and expect to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility must ask why should care about action when one side can lose and haven be told otherwise why should root for the yankee the only reason can see be because the bad guy loki wear ridiculous look costume keep attempt to find redemption in society reception of this movie maybe that why hope that m just miss big part of the backstory m big whedon fan and come into the avenger hop to see some more of his magic be reward with two and half hour snooze fest of cg action my only sincere hope be that the million he make off of this movie fund real project of his in the future
drab dull and predictable absolutely baffle why people go crazy for this it dull neither of the lead can sing and it predictable m not mad about musical but compare this to something like west side story or even oklahoma and it pal in comparison
delightful simpson episode to the big screen when successful tv series be be transport to the big screen there always some expectation and worry lie ahead some of the big screen adaptation of series work well south park ducktales can remember others by now others works terrible hannah montana thankfully simpsons the movie be not on the latter mention category since it already two year since this movie be release ll guess many have already see it so it go to be unnecessary to tell the fan to not worry but for those who haven see it don worry simpson the movie be delightful and highly entertaining movie experience series adaptation or not the movie be fresh amusing and never get bore during it 87 minute of screen time it also surprisingly funny just as the funny episode use to be it never feel odd or strange to see the character in movie situation since one be use to see them during 21 minute or so in episode set almost all the dear and familiar character from the show be in the movie and their personality be like you re use to see them there be some few new touch though like the sweet and increase relationship between ned flanders and bart homer bonding to the spider pig and maggie be smart which be nice to see the animation it self live up to the standard of the series and it bright colorful and refresh despite there be some few and obvious cgi shot who stand out the score be great and support the movie without be distractive there be also some few cameo by green day and arnold schwarzenegger which be fun to watch the plot it self isn so distinctive like usual there be some mistake to make and lesson to learn by the character but the story still work pretty well overall can recommend simpson the movie highly enough it a successful adaptation of one of the world best and funny series and have the spirit of the show as well by the way get sure to not stop the movie before the end credit roll out
the antithesis of eastwood iconic career be sombre reflexive challenging and utterly accomplish eastwood final western be the antithesis of his iconic career and perhaps even the american western as genre unforgiven 1992 be sombre and reflexive piece that isn afraid to be morally complex and present all its character along with their callous act of violence with an objective honesty so that the viewer can draw their own conclusion about who be right and whether violence be ever an appropriate response it a refreshingly intelligent picture that never spell anything out and be all the more compelling for it easily become one of the most emotionally invest and rivet film in its genre this be rare challenge stuff that treat its audience with respect and be accomplish storytelling on many level 9 10
iconic as you like this movie be probably on par with the same amount of stuff influence with the godfather the main plot be easy enough to follow however it have deep philosophical meaning comment on the harsh reality of war through the imagery of burn house racism through the idea of faction not from there try to fit in and come of age story for our main protagonist kikuchiyo the character be likeable funny and charismatic which make any death hard to watch and feel meaningful the plot be set up beautifully however it can be slow to mind numbing pace this be easily work around though as you can not not concentrate as it in japanese it be quite tough watch as it have challenge idea constant take in of information be in japanese black and white and the allude to snail pace at time there be not lot of humor however when there be it dark and incredibly hilarious the action scene be more stylistic than substantive but all in all it be 1954 so the ability to shoot incredible action scene wasn develop to the extent it be now the movie create suspense tension and fear for the impending doom that be yet to come the art director be brilliant never lose sight of the 16th century ideal this help to immerse you in the movie acting and score can fall flat at time especially when the plot slow this be because of the storytelling be less focus on japan reply to the western genre hit it out of the park all in all

linger like many adolescent male hurriedly saw the rock soon after its release as soon as could like everyone else say it be great movie have lot of action be extremely cool blah blah blah then saw beverly hill cop and top gun and realize that jerry bruckheimer be the most overrated producer in hollywood it also solidify my point that michael bay be both overrated and not talented the release of armageddon and pearl harbor cement that think so hard in my brain that will not be see another of his movie again there be ambitious director like oliver stone steven spielberg and sam mendez then there be wannabe like brian depalma walter hill and michael bay if john hughes have be able to rebound from his failure curly sue with something along the line of ferris bueller or the breakfast club he would be back on my grade list with the rock we get by the number action effort that use lot of dialogue to try and get depth out of thin character nicolas cage and sean connery be fun to watch but only on surface value both have do well work on good movie ed harris show he will never lose his tough guy image even 20 year after the right stuff that bring me to the next victim han zimmer poor han he be force into make typical action garbage that prove several thing 1 he be not james horner 2 he be not john williams williams ability to extract emotion from the audience will probably never be match in our lifetime 3 he be not jerry goldsmith jerry have go through every type of topic know to man and yet he be still the most underappreciated talent in hollywood thankfully hans rebound with gladiator prove he finally know how to write music as you can guess he didn get the oscar for it the action in the rock be all about linger they linger on crushed corpse the linger on an impale corpse they linger on frustrated ed harris action be about that action it be about fluidity and motion not sit around while something else happen if they want to sit around then that suspense overall fair enough action effort that have no surprise or lasting appeal john woo would get it right with face off 2 5 out of 5 star
sloppy and unengaging after read roger ebert great movie review of this and hear from others that it be the new 2001 space odyssey have very high expectation for this film while roger ebert review be very well write and many of his point be accurate the film be let down and do not at all achieve the greatness that many have claim it have it have an interesting concept to begin with young girl fascinate by communication get to use her passion to pursue something beyond earth the first part of the film and the set up be interesting and adequate but the film crumbles in on itself when matthew mcconaughey character be introduce and the film become sloppy boring and dumb his character be suppose to contrast ideologically with jodie foster ellie arroway since this be pg rat film and can not be cliche they naturally have to fall in love for short time despite an astounding lack of emotional connection and interest in their relationship his character come back later on in dumb un creative and annoy way just to add conflict and depth to the story character even though it doesn the story have its high point and it have its low point it do manage at time to match 2001 space odyssey visual effect and intriguing concept but then return to the human world and reverse any smart theme or message back into the dumb faith v proof argument the way that this message be execute be poor and take away from the great story of space exploration and contact with other worldly being instead of extend the story and create new aspect of debate and discussion the film be distinctly divide between its religious scientific message and its 2001 like grandness of space perhaps if this film go for less realistic approach and focus more on the smart theme of space exploration while also explore the psyche of its main character it could have be consider classic more on par with 2001 space odyssey in the end can recommend this film because it end up pander to young audience by dumbing down its theme and topic that alienate pun intend audience in search of smarter more mature film
slick comedy mystery from mgm franchot tone and ann sothern star as joel and garda sloane in this slick lighthearted murder mystery joel loan his good friend mike lee bowman 5 000 to invest in beauty pageant mike invite joel to the pageant and enlist him as judge when the pageant producer be murder and the police be convince that mike do it joel and garda decide to investigate in order to clear mike it all bit of lark since no one really like the murder victim as to be expect tone and sothern do good job with their banter and comedic flair however sothern garda excessive jealousy of joel casual attention to the bevy of beauty quickly become boring and somewhat annoy the bit about the lion tamer frank orth and his two lion be far fetch but quite funny this be an entertaining and enjoyable movie and be recommend
a view of the ark have to admit when first heard about paramount intention to reboot the whole noah epic be bit skeptical not because worry about them monkey with scriptural accuracy though that played part but because the story of noah do not lend itself to the traditional hollywood model how do you shove square peg into round hole without shave off important biblical truth many have try all have fail fortunately skepticism give way to relief as the story unfolded aronofsky and handel manage to accomplish the seemingly impossible an entertaining version of the noah story be creative license take absolutely necessarily so this be fun action pack biblical epic that manage to uphold the important pillar of the genesis tale highly recommend
overblown super exaggerate trash and love every minute be quite fan of the team when be wee lad thanks mostly to cable tv rerun and be eagerly anticipate this movie from the moment saw the first episode at no time do think it wouldn happen of course as the year pass and grow old and wiser come to realise that an team movie might just be really bad idea mean mon an ex army unit that never kill anyone that use ridiculous plan that frequently break the law of logic and physic yeah right fortunately when this film be announce couldn help but feel little excited especially when that cast come forward and the first trailer have me rev up and nervous could so easily be trash well it be trash trash of the most glorious overblown wonderfully fun kind tongue plant firmly in cheek and with utter acknowledgement of the fact that the most it can aspire to be fun night out the cinematic equivalent to big mac ridiculously bad for you and part of you wish you hadn but you still enjoy the hell out of it anyway the cast work well together and have pretty good team dynamic liam neeson bring the right combo of gruffness and cool to hannibal though little more humourless than george peppard and bradley cooper be well bradley cooper wise cracking and entertaining as con man face though many have speak ill of quinton rampage jackson as a thought he be capable enough in role that require little more of him than snarl water down catch phrase of the foursome the easy stand out be sharlto copley jittery crazy eye murdock who manage to steal the scene whenever the camera lingers on him for more than three second if district 9 mark him as bright new talent hopefully this film should make him star jessica biel as conflicted agent and face ex charisa sosa and patrick wilson as smug cia man lynch offer some fine support but really this film all about the action and the action and the action which be serve up with trowel most of it wonderfully overblown but in that great aw that be cool way that be prevalent in the eighty though the level of exaggeration which the climax reach do start to stretch even the most resilient switch off action fan all in all my best advice be sit back switch off and enjoy the ride it may not be the team you remember but it a hell of lot of brainless fun nonetheless and we really haven have that for while

a gory disappointment from tarantino note haven see vol 2 yet m definitely not an admirer of tarantino work but m always try to see all major hollywood movie and expect something well than that gory disaster the story here be terribly weak and primitive like an adaptation of poor comic book with lot of plot hole and all connection with reality be entirely lose in kill bill assassin woman seek revenge and almost everyone she meet get kill nobody care about character they be only decoration for bride long way of revenge we see them after while they get kill and soon we forget about them there be no point deny that tarantino have his own style and he want to amaze an audience but think this time he go too far some scene like woman who couldn move her toe after all thing she have do only make me laugh from their stupidity and absurdity however that not all maybe something be wrong with me but find many part of the movie too disgust even take into account tarantino standard don see in the movie any reason for that or any author philosophy or intention which make any sense unfortunately the movie simply look like one very long brutal bloody fight scene with short silly and predictable dialog addition which be mostly intend to excite young teen these scene be too stylize with nothing particularly original or extraordinary in them in japan bride be fight against dozen of opponent but only few of them be actually move and fight the rest of them be wait for something perhaps for the short moment when they must appear in front of camera and after short fight get kill until that short moment of glory they be nothing more than decoration such choreography could be enough for cheap eastern action flick but not for movie that pretend for much good hand to hand fight be much good and sometimes be able to impress but there be also strong feeling of surrealism and even of somewhat that look like attractive from inside but inwardly shallow and empty as already mention vol 1 be an extremely brutal and gory movie somewhere in the middle of the movie realize that there be nothing else in kill bill besides endless violence guess that the reason for split kill bill into two movie be that more than three hour of non stop over the top violence would be too much even for his fan if such movie come from any other director believe it get nc 17 rating but it obvious that for tarantino there be no rule or limit so there be nothing surprise that it have only rating only for one of the most memorable sequence in the movie the anime sequence it deserve nc 17 besides its ultra violent style the parent can find some moral problem with kill bill so have to warn all parent that this acclaimed movie must stay away from your child as far as it possible despite the director statement about award for uma turman who play the main character didn find anything exception about the acting in the movie actually too often there be no room for act behind fight scene and short dialog be not only truly disappointed about waste my time and money but also get negative experience which will be glad to forget
creepy but very enjoyable the neverending story be good movie with great storyline and lot of fun and imaginative character find this movie very creepy at time for family film as child it really creep me out and watch it today still think it very strange at time most child will probably enjoy it but think that protective parent should definitely watch this movie on their own before let their kid watch it the movie be lot of fun and love all the colorful animation and the character especially falkor always want one of them when be child and still think it would be awesome to have one today it be good family movie with nice fairytale theme but it can get creepy at time especially towards the end but if your child aren very sensitive then its movie for the whole family to enjoy lonely boy be transport to the magic land of fantasia by book land create by the dream of people on earth and it be upto him to save this world from the nothing
bad tarantino movie m big fan of tarantino movie but have to admit that this be his bad movie waste of brilliant cast for movie without purpose the typical tarantino end be meaningless in this movie it look like we re watch two different style one that happen throughout the whole movie and one in the final scene very boring movie the usual phenomenon of high scoring film just because the director be reputable realize that it should make people feel intellectual by always give good mark to well known filmmaker but it really mislead those who be guide by imdb score if this movie be from less know director the imdb score would probably be 5 6

seven samurai there be nuanced feel between new release could score an 8 10 say the dark kinght rise 2012 and classic acquire the same rank but if divide more precisely which feel compulsory to do but in lack of potential spur to re set my entire rating system tdkr be around 7 8 8 2 while seven samurai be surely waver around 8 2 8 5 seven samurai an esteemed masterpiece from the reasonably most eminent auteur akira kurosawa not only from japan but the wholesale film history as well why my belated first view have tad underwhelming collision notably juxtapose with another akira chef oeuvre rashomon 1950 9 10 which have be my one and only entrance before seven samurai this action saga of seven samurai train local village farmer and fight against bandit have thrill in depth character building deployment and the action sequence be cut edge of its time and seminally full flown censure upon class discrimination could reverberate till today although we be mile away from the feudal era against 207 minute run time surprisingly still can not distinctively tell each samurai from their appearance and 4 of them all die from musket be grave ridicule of the deprivation ridden samurai social stratum nothing be remotely close to any dueling style combat which prefigure during the much hype final showdown but the camera work from asaichi nakai be first class roller coaster ride since the fight kick off leave woeful curtain call of four disturb graf stand under the background which potently end the film in provoke manner the cast be excellent by and large with shimura give compose and sage leadership with his empathetic charisma mifune on the other hand be more rely on his own panache to contradict his identity dilemma from farmer bear orphan to an unclassified samurai wannabe several support role be also glisten bokuzen hidari chicken and wordless farmer who finally deliver his only line during his last breath be strike deep in my mind miyaguchi superbly practice swordsman also exemplify the most orthodox samurai image they be all among the marrow of my first view the sway of the harakiri spirit be ubiquitous particularly among the ill fat bandit which occasion some random thought such as instead of execute themselves on the ultimate suicidal march they could have retreat and recruit more people and then plot their revenge which make for more common sense instead of be drag from the horse and slaughter one by one by the samurai farmer coalition the storyline set seem to choose an easy way out and avoids undermine the film integrity and leave an edgy unfinished business nevertheless be this some overt contrivance which plain suffices to facilitate the film which should be at least point out or maybe should watch more japanese film to digest their ethos and frame of mind

we all watch the watchman let get this out of the way watchmen the movie be not as good as the graphic novel zack snyder watchman be not your average graphic novel adaptation unlike with 300 which be short and sharp and shallow and easy to adapt the original watchman be incredibly dense and as write unfilmable so snyder do something very smart he didn even try what he do instead be to take the world of watchman and rebuild it in way which make virtue of this new medium film rather than try to cram the graphic novel into cinematic form nowhere be this approach more obvious than in the film title sequence wonderfully composed collage of image depicts scene from the universe of watchman in way which be only possible in the movie in this way we be subconsciously introduce to world where costume hero be part of everyday culture and brought in stylish and fluid way from the original day of the minuteman to those of the watchman this introduction be cinematically perfect and be indicative of the height which the watchman movie be perfectly capable of achieve but not quite capable of sustain watchen be brave film for major studio to make and without doubt it would not exist in its present form without the success of 300 it be incredibly dark both in tone as well as shoot style with event that would be anathema to any other superhero story the less you know about the story the good so there will be no spoiler here but suffice to say watchman version of happy end be far cry from the hollywood norm snyders bring his unique approach to action to bear on watchman expand on the action scene in the comic without make it feel too redundant his effort be ably support by the incredibly game cast excellent cinematography and near perfect visual effect this film be incredible to look at but also manage to create an entire world in way which most superhero story never do the attention to detail in even the small scene be commendable and the dense flashback structure mean the same attention be pay to the presentation of full and complex character snyder have make film which be gorgeous to look at agreeably violent well write wonderfully design and feature some of the best small scale action sequence ever commit to celluloid but naturally not everything be perfect most of the performance be excellent with cast of relative unknown who manage to distinguish themselves despite constantly compete with overbear effect and design patrick wilson in particular do great work with difficult role as nite owl while jackie earle hayley be blister as rorschach unfortunately in film which could have do with strong female presence neither carla gugino nor malin ackerman make much of an impression despite have quite lot of screen time synder musical cue be another bone of contention often push the tone of the film into the realm of parody and the end well let just say it cheapen the experience in search of the low common denominator and the whole package suffers on related note neither of the story major revelation be handle that well these moment be genuinely shock in the graphic novel but be almost gloss over in the film don get the wrong impression watchman be good film sometimes great film snyder have manage to make movie which be terrifically well balanced compromise between accessibility and fidelity that anyone can sit down in the cinema and experience distillation of the watchman universe in just 163 minute be marvel it do not deliver the depth of feeling and connection of the novel but that be more matter of the difference in the medium than failure on the part of the film on its own merit zack synder watchman be dark and twisted tale people with complex character whose motivation be not obvious even to themselves it be solid film sometimes rise into the extraordinary and deserve to be successful this be not alan moore watchman but it be competent extension of the universe into another medium and worthy cinema go experience

absolutely love it be take aback by all of the negative review of this movie but have be eagerly anticipate its release and be certainly not disappointed could see how those who be not familiar with the stage play may critique the lack of plot but actually felt that the movie be much improve in this area find myself understand and see underlie theme in way never fully realize in the stage version love the new song by taylor swift and the role that victoria play in the narrative as whole the casting be almost spot on and find myself bring to tear at the emotional climax of particular note the fantastic performance by judy dench francesca hayward robert fairchild laurie davidson and jennifer hudson really stand out to me the character felt as if they have so much more depth particularly the dramatically different portrayal of mr mistoffolees the choreography and staging be beautiful can not wait to go back to the theatre to see this again and will definitely be add this to my dvd collection
poor adaptation what bitter disappointment in order to explain what be miss from the film please allow me to describe what love about the book suzanne collins creates move portrayal of girl live under cruel dictatorship set against background of extreme poverty these book show how the unequal distribution of wealth affect panem society those live in the wealthy capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the district that they regard the death of district child as entertainment the violence in the hunger game be shock because it be brutal and unnecessary yet wholly embrace even celebrate by capitol resident as for the district tributes they be not enemy but they kill each other all the same some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm as the trilogy progress it become compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence however these theme be weave into the book in such way that you may not even notice they re be discuss you become so immersed in katniss world that poverty be give and violence sad but expect part of life the film follow the basic storyline but lack emotional depth the character development be almost nonexistent and the death in the arena be bloodless in every sense of the word the tribute be little more than walk stereotype so their death have no impact even rue death heart wrench in the book be little more than side note in the movie if hadn read the book don think would have understand the dynamic between the tribute at all include the conflict relationship between katniss and peeta their romance come across as cheesy and unconvincing there be no hint of the bond that grow between them as the story progress perhaps my big criticism of this movie be that no one seem to be go hungry can not believe the filmmaker overlook this important point the capitol exploitation of the district be suppose to be the backdrop for the entire story when katniss arrive in the capitol and observe how food appear at touch of button she can not understand how capitol resident fill their time the majority of her day be consume with feed her family it define her most of the tribute have never have enough to eat and this be major factor in the game the beginning of the movie seem promise the ominous mood in district 12 be just right it be apparent that the people who live there be exhaust and resign to their fate when resident appear for the reaping they look like cattle be round up for slaughter the capitol in contrast be frighten in it frenetic artificiality this juxtaposition be well do however the filmmaker lose me when the tribute enter the arena there be no sense of tension the tribute make all kind of noise as they move through the wood seemingly oblivious to the fact that they be be hunt katniss stand about ten foot away from cato as he snap boy neck and we be suppose to believe he doesn see her the scene from the control room be pointless and add nothing to the movie they should have spend that time on character development unfortunately this lack of character development cause the emotional scene to fall flat be astound this be even possible give the subject matter but the overall result lack intensity and depth will credit elizabeth bank with an excellent portrayal of effie trinket she add humor and sense of the absurdity of capitol life donald sutherland also do well as president snow jennifer lawrence be an adequate katniss but josh hutcherson be terrible as peeta he just not very likable we see none of his inner strength instead he come across and whiny and weak and wes bentley seem to be include just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard one more thing what happen to haymitch he suppose to be self destructive drunk his cunning be all the more unexpected because he seem incapable of take care of himself be thrill when they cast woody harrelson and he do well in some part but it seem like they have to water down his character to market it to young adult this movie have lot of potential but it fell short in many important way score of 3 10 be pretty harsh but felt as though the filmmaker keep all of the plot point and none of the meaning read the book instead
absolutely pathetic well how do start really have lot of expectation on this film but unfortunately ve be absolutely disappointed must admit though the first 5 minute be promise lol as soon the 4 horseman meet in the the bos flat let call him like that the movie start it non stop ravine fall the film have everything hate on film childish story hardly credible teenage storyline lack of suspense in the development of the plot and very predictable end which be absolutely embarrass to the viewer however there be something you can save of this fire the outstanding performance of morgan freeman mark ruffalo and michael caine even though they re not by far worth of swallow this horrible sleeping pill
total rubbish this have get to be one of the bad action movie that have ever see the lead actor be totally waste on this rubbish samuel jackson must be desperate for paycheck to even think of lower himself in part like these don know why the maker of movie these day even bother hire scriptwriter as the entire movie be just one long k or endless variation of the word they even manage to cram three s into one sentence it be strictly by the number movie the head of the agency be masculine look woman the agent assign to protect jackson be woman the villain have seemingly thousand of henchman all willing to die at his bidding there be the van chase through the street the motorbike chase through the market the motorboat chase through the canal yawn if you be 12 year old and like to hear the word over and over again or otherwise totally brain dead then you will love this mess of movie
respect demand respect very inspiring film walk out of the cinema feeling like there be good even in the unlikeliest of people the dialogue be well write and the main character be equally as loveable viggo mortensens act be only overshadow by that of mahershala ali whose portrayal of an educated african american man living in 1960 america be both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious while mortensen stand for most of the comic relief find myself laugh the hard from ali deadpan delivery through the character of dr shirley the story of black man who struggle to gain the respect of his fellow african american while simultaneously resist and pull at the root of the racism and oppression which keep him from be as successful as the american and european who should be his equal by all measure musical and educational while the story and plot leave little to be desire felt one or two joke be shoe horn in and would have be well discard the visual tone be fit to the film but the camerawork be nothing out of the ordinary not all film call for out of this world originality in all mark however and this film allow the audience to focus on what be really important
such interesting idea that leave you hungry for more really enjoy this movie particularly at the start the first chunk be great when the lead and the first cell mate be talk the dialogue be great and really sharp this momentum carry in for most of the movie how ever it do seem to grid to holt somewhere in the third act and to be honest it be the tail end of the 3rd act it have lot of build up and mystery and come the third act they set it up like they be gon na get some answer and they be gon na make change and then it just like flat you keep wait for something to happen and then it doesn there be plot twist at the end but then it still just kinda limp on for another ten minute till the credit roll the allegory be also very in your face but work for the most part my interpretation be that it be an allegory for societal class and rich v poor but it doesn make much sense they be to me randomly assigned floor each month so that isn a class that be just ever change one mouth you be the rich and then next you be the poor do understand that in it self be interest as you never know where you will land so you need to treat everyone well guess wish the action determine where they land but maybe that would be different movie also would have love to explore the world more this idea be so intriguing why be this facility make who be the administration do anyone ever leave alive feel like this movie could have delve deeply into the lore of this world and really flesh it out and colour it in bit more so like say think the majority of this movie be great but there be just some point that kinda knock it down for me but they don ruin the film so give it watch
this film be very fabricate in its character and story development wasn planning to see the pianist after hear about the award and nomination decide to watch it don think that this movie portray the life of the pianist and his compassion for music very well all ve see from this film be the brutality of the nazi also feel that the emotion and relationship between character in this film be weakly portrayed it doesn show family relationship the most important element in this film wasn depict the pianist desire and passion for music this film be very fabricate in its character and story development think this movie depict the brutality and cruelty of the nazis very well however when it come to the connection between character story and emotion all it show be montage of idea not fully developed story
room be not as good as everyone say it be room star brie larson and jacob tremblay it offer larson her best performance of her career and tremblay break out role while he may not quite get past the whole quot kid actor quot stereotype he be admittedly good than almost every other child actor out there today both of these actor be receive some serious award buzz right now as be this film in general this may be due to the odd nature of its plot line mother and child be stick inside room for at least five year of their life trap inside never once go out to see or experience the world so when they get out we watch as this child get to see everything for the first time br br yes it 39 an interesting plot that hasn 39 really be do before but it can 39 really pull it off it 39 odd that it struggle so bad with make this worthy adaption of the book see as the author actually write the film much like last year 39 go girl 39 however 39 go girl 39 actually have good director br br the one other film this director have do be 39 frank 39 so have high hope for this film unfortunately he may have prove to us that he be one hit wonder because this film be not near as good as everyone be say this mainly steam from sloppy write writing that would 39 ve probably work in book format in that format you be able to show character thought and feeling far easy than in film so you have to write accordingly br br but this doesn 39 happen this be really the only reason this film fail but it fail hard from the first scene of the film it be pretty clear that not enough thought go into make this piece of cinema character action and reaction to everything feel absurdly artificial like cop figure out where the room they live in be from one extremely vague sentence or how the film seem to pretend like these two have never make one single escape attempt br br literally the second escape they try get them out couldn 39 help think that they have never actually try because the guy didn 39 even hesitate to buy into their trick in fact not one person in this film react naturally everyone be an extreme version of normal person and it make nearly everyone in the film super unlikable especially the main two character they do virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they want for no apparent reason br br almost every conversation end in an annoy scream match between random people scream match that either make no sense or just make you dislike the character so when these two get out it 39 hard to legitimately care about them you don 39 know anything about them other then the fact that they like yell for no reason br br 39 room 39 may have strong performance and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else it have hard time make you actually care about its character no one react like human be but instead yell at each other when ever they feel like they need to it waste its best quality with limp and lifeless script that fail to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel
erotic thriller dull the sens brian de palma have often come in for some flak over the year his penchant for stick tight to alfred hitchcock thriller formula have be the source of much consternation in certain quarter yet when you view something like peter hall never talk to stranger it ram home just how welcome it be to have hitch like thriller at least do well rebecca de mornay be troubled shrink who whilst deal with the mind game of serial kill loony harry dean stanton meet sexually charge latino guy antonio banderas and indulges in passion unbound then she start to get very unwelcome present in the post the erotic thriller have be well trodden and will continue to be so for sure so it feel little churlish to decry hall movie for come off as weak will imitator of previous purveyor of the sub genre but this blend of silence of the lambs meet sea of love cum dress to kill cum fatal attraction etc etc just come across as cheat and that because it be the maker know this and try to hide their ridiculous folly behind eroticism as the two lovely look headline star get sweaty and wet indulging in sexual play that as powerful as the surroundings banderas life in loft apartment resplendent with metal cage and wrought iron door but or should that be butt the mystery element be weak the suspense equally so while the back story of de mornay father key character be hopelessly under develop then there be d stanton steal every scene be he be in quid pro quo indeed yet he hardly in the film which ultimately prove to be tragedy as the plot hurtle towards its implausible and risible revelation red herring come and go as quickly as becca and tony underwear the continuity editor should have be sack along with the writer because of one scene btw and even though pino donaggio score the music with customary swirl quality this just come off as piggyback tactic this be poor thriller in spite of two very committed and visually attractive perfs from the lead and of course stanton knowingly sleazy turn seek this out only if you think body of evidence be in the upper echelon of erotic thriller 5 10
an entertaining journalism drama from spielberg spielberg new drama about the controversial publication of the pentagon paper by the washington post and new york time be well make and entertain albeit not perfect film tom hank give thorough and enjoyable performance as ben bradlee but it be meryl streep who truly stand out in the cast here through her role as kay graham bob odenkirk support role be also noteworthy in very positive sense the film be thoroughly grip although it sometimes feel pace slightly clumsily through omission of detail that could have be good to include as spielberg present the audience with the turbulent politics of the vietnam era that lead to the intense legal and ideological controversy surround the pentagon paper additionally rush albeit still very enjoyable third act make the viewer feel that the film run time be bit too short the film be an enjoyable watch in way that other journalism film like all the president men and spotlight while good film overall for sure be not but its tone be handle well throughout if spielberg drama have teach me one thing it that he clearly know how to let specific tone manifest itself throughout the course of narrative and do that well the film contain few moment that feel bit meh very clichéd rather than powerful discussion of the importance of freedom of the press in the second half be one while it have neither the high emotional stake and dramatic tension of bridge of spy or the clockwork precision of lincoln it be still very well act and entertain film that do recommend 7 10
wow go into the movie with modest expectation wasn expect masterpiece but absolutely wasn expect this be blow away by this movie it keep me interested from start to finish even though the movie contain lot few battle scene than previously expect it be still intriguing and make any battle scene that much more rewarding this could be the movie that help netflix win their first academy award for best picture highly recommend that anyone with netflix account watch this you win regret it
perception of inception it have take me 9 year to get round to watch this and during that time look forward more and more to see it be it worth the wait no find it difficult to find anything positive to say but the premise and idea of the film be interest that sadly be all its an overblown mess of movie with no place for connection to the film character collection of choreographed fight scene connect by dream science mumbo jumbo and accompany by bombastic score do not make an interesting movie mr nolan should have spend his time focus on coherent story and some character development less time on try to shoehorn in pointless action bitter dissapointment of movie
great movie have to admit that m really convince of the concept of put an animated tv series on the big screen in the first place even the south park movie that try to incorporate theatrical element such as the musical number didn really justify the need for cinematic adventure most animated comedy show have very fast paced humour with quick edit this work for an episode of 25 30 minute but in movie with 90 minute run time it would really great for the audience as consequence the simpson movie be unusually slow at time at the same time the storyline be not really stretch to cinematic proportion epic as it may be similar topic have already be deal with in the tv show and good it be say before and it true nothing here try to push any boundary and except for the length of the whole thing and maybe some annoy people in the theatre who watch the movie with you you would never realise that this be simpson motion picture other flaw include the fact that some inhabitant of springfield have only very brief cameo mr burn and that some idea have be use in fairly similar way before as entertaining as the movie still may be it be also pretty predictable at time this kind of underachieving as some critic call it may have its own charm but in the end one would have hop for this to be bit more special the movie be by no mean catastrophe but by simpson standard it just not good enough the simpson have become brand people know what to expect and therefore applaud even relatively average movie like this one to rely on that be bit lazy however and one wish that producer put an end to homer adventure as long as we can still remember him and the other beloved inhabitant of springfield as character that completely revolutionise comedy at one point and not as money make merchandise prop

great serial killer drama m one of those people who tend to think that south korean movie be perhaps bit too slow pace for my taste memory of murder isn a fast pace film by any mean but this time the slow pace make this movie about an investigation of serial killing so much good than 95 of its american counterpart essentially memory of murder be drama first with thriller and comedy element yes in the first hour or so the movie be actually quite funny kang ho song and sang kyung kim be brilliant as the two cop who have drastically different view on how to solve crime the character development be fascinate and believable thanks to great script highly recommend

christmas spirit as far as tv be full of rubbish on christmas night choose to watch elf as the less annoying program be prejudice with this kind of comedy and unfortunately be unlucky enough to confirm my opinion once again except the 4 5 first minute before the opening credit the whole thing be huge disappointment it be suppose to be film for christmas spirit and lose childishness probably ι have distort point of view on how christmas spirit should be present and what can be the meaning at least for the people who still believe in it peace love altruism elf try to convince the audience that christmas spirit be overconsumption in the near mall and santa claus be guy who take break between the shot of well know refreshment advertising fully agree to previous review say that this film be make without any talent and producer should offer the amount give for the elf to the homeless if they really want to promote christmas spirit another paradox in this movie be that the main contributor be jewish that mean that they could not have real feeling for the subject they have choose to film really what be the necessity of menorah as background in the doctor wait room or snowflake make of paper depict the star of david in film for christmas plot be totally predictable without any deviation from hollywood formula for family comedies the kind hearted naive hero who manage to change the hardhearted guy at the end bla bla bla james caan do his best and he succeed and his poorly write character be decent will ferrell be unbearable as usual my opinion choose something else
meh it not eventful enough but good cool short movie to watch
cynical with capital my wife and be joke because we rent our daughter 2 and 4 year old barbie and the magic of pegasus or something along those line we be chuckle over the fact that the film which feature purple fly horse ice skate princess baby polar bear fairy and elf etc etc could only be the byproduct of multiple focus group conduct with girl age 3 to 5 then my wife pop in under the tuscan sun which feature divorcée from the state buy quaint tuscan villa where not shred of anything tasteless can be see so that she can start her life over romance and foregone conclusion abound bla bla bla tell me m not the only one who see the irony here academically act write direct etc this be an average movie so ll give it 5 but it if you love movie mean honestly love them this movie be proof that hollywood hate them

simply brilliant this movie have one of will smith best performance with the right emotion and never ruin moment with inappropriate comedy the whole film be good balance of drama suspense and action not to mention terror the film can be heartbreaking at time to the point myself be draw to tear can say much about this movie without spoil it for those who may have not see it but the score by james newton howard be sadden and one of his best the atmosphere be full of silent tension despite it short length the film be an escapade that must be see to be believe over all great film and definitely recommend it

my 11 favorite film of all time what thrill joy t be when be kid and what trill joy it still be what an intriguing concept to make an alien from another planet befriend child from earth at first the encounter be extremely tentative then by the end become great friendship what an exhilarate score from john williams probably the best composer in film history this rank as one of his best the music dance and flow with the image on the screen with sweeping majesty it range from the foreboding to the thrilling in my personal opinion this be spielberg best he say he would never make sequel to t because it be too close to his heart for one applaud such choice for gutless industry that pump out hundred of sequel remake spin offs etc year
a retelling of classic with fresh perspective fun hilarious and overall entertaining this modern remake have plenty of material that differentiate itself as its own movie because of the gender swap the film be able to retell this story in its own unique way the film acknowledge the 1987 version respectfully through some story beat as if to tell the audience that the filmmaker adore the original as well it be heartwarming charm and hilarious flick for both new audience and fan of the classic
never before in my life be my cheek more aching but oh be thankful for it all through the movie keep on have this big large smile sculpt into my face for the record m 25 year old and ve read the lord of the ring in three time for the first time when be six or seven year old ever since then read it at least once or twice year therefore you can count me as fan for follow the same cult fan procedure with the hobbit and the silmarillion as well now onto the movie gosh saw it more than one time and keep want more of it it just never get boring really enjoy the little stuff that be find throughout the movie for fan of the book the map on bilbo table in his house come to mind it be exactly as the one in the hobbit book that own and also incredibly enjoy the intro sequence with the re telling of the battle against sauron from the silmarillion never have an ultimate evil be be so well depict on the screen it truly be sauron those who argue the movie cut too many part or that it change the story too much be totally wrong this movie could not have show the whole first time in its entirety keep in mind that the audiobook version of fellowship of the ring last well over ten hour make movie this long would well make it way too long and besides how would you financially sustain such project ve read reviewer say he make all three book with the time allow for the first movie alone think it would be very fast forward experience of movie with alvin and the chimpmunks kind of voice incredibly stupid to say the least ok so there be change in the movie well this be jackson vision of it all of us have our own vision of the book which may or may not be compatible with that of jackson but can safely assume that nobody can say they have hundred percent the same vision of the story as tolkien that the thing with book each reader have different vision of it as for me be blow away never before have felt so much at home in movie it be as if have take walk in the town where grow up the shire rivendell moria lorien everything felt so much like home be move can not tell of another movie that have me shed tear just by see landscape on screen as for the change well found good reason behind all of them and let me tell you right away be happy that arwen save frodo yes maybe come from fan it will look like absolute heresy but enjoy the scene lot do not enjoy it because it be supposedly politically correct to do so or that find liv tyler to be absolutely attractive it be just because felt like even though it be big change from the book it be very good one indeed it make you discover the power determination and courage of elf and the fact that even elven woman although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterpart and beside as arwen be to become queen later on it be pretty good to see her have great first appearance the actor be great they be lot into their character and for the first time saw elf as they be quick agile terrifyingly effective in battle just look at how legolas deal with the horde of enemy without single hint of fear in his eye these be elf as they should be gimli be great too know people seem to think many character be not develop enough but by the action you can learn lot with gimli lot can be learn about the dwarf their pride deep sense of honor and family their mistrust of elf their love for strong beer and good fight against anything big and their sheer hatred for orcs and the like aragorn be totally the ranger character the end scene as he walk toward the horde of uruk hai warrior be great his attitude his clothes everything about him just cry ranger boromir be very well depict desperate to save the people of gondor by any mean necessary robbed of all hope yet in the end he redeem himself by show his true valour deep down he willing to die to defeat evil and when he recognize his king in aragorn on his last breath felt like watch hero die it be move the hobbit be all great frodo be deeply sad and fatalist and sam be just the best friend everyone would like to have just as it should be finally we have gandalf quite frankly he look mighty ian be gandalf the faceoff against the balrog in the moria be memorable sequence and just show how strong he really be to be able to vanquish such foe can wait for his return quite frankly can wait for the two other movie in the meantime ll watch this one over and over again this movie have everything that good movie need to have and more plus it just might bring more people to actually read book that have more page than the average little 25 novel that have no value in it which be great parent maybe some scene will frighten your kid but this movie have almost no blood even though it have good share of battle and the foe be undeniably evil plus it have good value in it friendship courage responsiblity sacrifice for good cause and the belief that anyone can help to change thing this be worthy of tolkien this be movie that will go down in history as be one of the best ever for sure
anthony hopkins best performance since silence of the lambs my grandfather struggle with dementia for the last few year of his life and this movie help me understand his experience and struggle so much good be blow away with how moving and incredible this movie be this be film everybody should watch motion picture like this be the reason love film
a special effect extravaganza if you ve see the trailer for this movie you re probably expect fast paced adventure non stop action and special effect extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting and if that what you re hop for you certainly win be disappoint because that exactly what you get in the mummy return write and direct by stephen sommers the story begin in egypt where rick connell brendan fraser and his wife evelyn rachel weisz discover an ancient bracelet that have once belong to warrior know as the scorpion king the rock who back in the day have sell his soul to the god anubis for control of his army and domination of the world now it seem the scorpion king resurrection be imminent and if he succeed and once again raise the army of anubis he could very well take over or destroy the world follower of im ho tep arnold vosloo however who be privy to this information as well decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face the scorpion king defeat him take control of anubis army and conquer the world himself put them in control but the key to the whole plan lie with who have control of the bracelet at the time of the scorpion king resurrection and the connells have take it back home with them to london so the adventure begin in earnest move from egypt to london then back again to egypt along the way there plenty of mummy fight and bug but very few surprise except for one scene near the end when something quite unexpected happen the story itself get somewhat lose in the muddle but it doesn really matter plot be fairly insignificant in movie like this as long as it maintain at least thread of credibility and can give the action some context and that it do so all be well and it allow you to get on with what this movie be really all about which simply put be have good time with shade of indiana jones and star war abound the real success of this movie lie in the fact that it never pretend to be anything other than what it be or what it be mean to be and that be an entertaining fun movie it visually explosive from the sweeping desert vista of the converge battling army to the mummy and assorted demon and creature generously sprinkle throughout and the hand to hand combat scene between evelyn and anck su namun patricia velazquez be especially thrill the one element of the film that doesn seem to work too well have to do with particular mode of transportation to which the connells must resort upon their return to egypt and which ultimately play significant part in the outcome of the whole adventure it something that seemingly would have be more appropriate in the adventure of baron munchausen or peter pan as far as the performance suffice to say that the actor involve all do their job well after all in movie like this you re not go to find anyone struggle with the method fraser strike handsome heroic pose call him poor man indiana jones and weisz be become as evelyn most importantly they all walk the walk and talk the talk and sommers keep them on track and wisely avoids allow any lapse into camp or tongue in cheek character interpretation which make this solid fun fill action adventure movie that be what it be the support cast include john hannah provide some comic relief as jonathan carnahan adewale akinnuoye agbaje lock nah freddie boath alex connell and obed fehr ardeth bay as with most sequel you ll get more out of the mummy return if you ve see the original which have more of story and of course would give you the background of the character but even on it own and take at face value this movie be feast for the sens and just lot of good fun just don go in expect anything more than what the trailer promise if you can do that chance be you re go to enjoy the movie and have good time rate this one 7 10
good surprise didn watch this early because formulate the ideia it be one of those hollywood nothing new movie with big star in it it just isnt it a hell of good movie with good act great character great script tom hardy should have win the oscar for this totally recomend it
confuse on first watch this film it be hard to know quite what have happen but on subsequent view it become more clear enjoy this movie dean cain be excellent in the role of bob lexa doig character be confuse to understand at first she be out to trap bob but really believe she land up love him although by then she have break his heart dean cain performance be an usual excellent he get well with every film he do my only question at the end of the film be what happen to bob camilla and the baby it be leave for the viewer to decide
junk woman movie with no reality and lot of corn be expect at least some nice tuscan scenery but even that elude the maker of this waste of two hour can handle girl movie like any guy so long as there some interest for person without their head stick in the cloud of implausibility and laughable female fantasy with not single iota of common sense if you want movie that be as unrealistic as kid fairytale then go for it but don expect great writing or wonderful scenery the little amount of scenic photography that appear in this film be brief and unspectacular the acting be force fake and ing awful to think this be base on book that woman flock to buy think that explain lot about why desperate housewife be so popular
fantastic documentary this great little movie with everything an excellent documentary need pathos drama tragedy and humour anthony baxter come across as very sympathetic and empathetic filmmaker who get to know the subject of him film the resident of balmedie very well and obviously gain their trust and friendship the theme ordinary people be steamroller by corporate greed be classic one and as the central figure of trump so typify the careless thoughtless greed of corporate america it make for one hell of drama great film well worth watch and look out for the sequel
fire whomever be responsible for the music on this show the musical interlude try to make every scene into cmt video be ruin this series it stand well enough on its own with the scenery and the cowboy way we do not need constant musical emphasis you re ruin this show fire the musical director whomever this idiot be
more of hollywood liberal propaganda this film be ok as film go from plot perspective however if you be sick and tired of hollywood liberal preaching and fringe idealism you should pass m not sure they the film maker could have stuff more of their idiotic agenda in this film be actually laugh during montage of the ascension of the evil conservative party they go from classic hitler image complete with red and black cross symbol of john hurt campaign to the mass to image of oppressed mass enforce by jackbooted military thug who target the poor downtrodden homosexual of the world good gravy be make plea here to those in hollywood stick to entertainment we the general mass do not care what you think
seriously the driver be man with mission to kill the people responsible for murder his brother on his trail be hit man look for challenge and drug addict cop be fan of the rock like welcome to the jungle lot but his other movie have be all little off so when initially saw this be quite happy an old school vengeance movie with real action star but what watch on screen be disaster the film be all over the place the main story of man seek vengeance for what have be do to him be enough to entertain the average audience and if do well can entertain every fan but this film apply british actor who look really weak m british by the way so it get nothing to do with the accent the hit man character be truly annoying and so be the beautiful maggie grace there kiss and ridiculous dialogue as well as background just take away any realism that the film have but whats even bad be billy bob thornton he seem to suck the life out of every scene the only plus part be dwayne johnson whose acting be seriously put to the test here and he do fantastic job carla gugino who play the lead detective very well and would have just be happy to see the both of them in the film another let down be the action scene or lack of action scene no scene of rock tear up his opponent like walk tall very bad
for the amateur of fresh flesh figuratively and literally the brilliant danish director nicolas wind refn have already offer us the sumptuous drive 2011 as well as interesting movie like valhalla rise 2009 bronson 2008 or bleeder 1999 in the neon demon 2016 nicolas wind refn lock himself in world dominate with an always ultra neat and globally irreproachable aesthetic and character who be deliberately cold and devoid of empathy after the first 20 30 minute we understand the message and the film would have benefit from be short film que nenni the film languishes and barely conveys emotion with few surrealistic and bloody scene thus the last third of the film be show as gore as annoy as synthesis visually amaze but desperately boring
thinly disguised movie in twenty year everybody will more or less agree that this be just fairly unimaginative and clumsy movie despite all the fuss and all the special effect that look so nice back then tolkien book be not flawless but whether you happen to be fan of the original or not jackson movie fail as base on book work it be neither faithful enough or independent enough to justify itself even bad it try so hard to be something grand that it also fail to be simple but entertaining adventure film if there one thing this movie should be remember for in the history of cinema it be the strong influence it have on the emerge tradition of use loud noise and spook visuals to build tension instead of resort to decent scriptwriting act and direct
great movie if you turn off your brain this be good movie if one be willing to overlook the hundred literally hundred of logical fallacy in this movie other review give good overview of the plot m not look to do that here just want to point out some plot inconsistency and or the lack of critical thinking that the character demonstrate will list few of my observation below 1 they go to waterfall where they can scream as loud as they want and the monster can hear them why not live there they could fish and collect drinking water near the river the monster would probably stay away from the area since the sound of the fall would impede their hunting ability 2 when take walk do anyone seriously let the young child of the group walk behind them why on earth would they let young boy walk hundred yard behind the adult in such dangerous situation they can even correct the boy if he make any mistake and indeed this result in his death 3 how on earth do they get the corn plant by hand after 400 day you wouldn see corn in nice little neat row like it be plant by farm equipment 4 since the monster can hear you if there be loud sound nearby why not bring out one of the downstairs speaker and blast something 24 7 on one of the nearby tree or on top of the house the monster would get use to the sound and leave the area alone leave the family to talk in peace 5 what human with brain wouldn consider make soundproof room they could go to the city get bunch of foam blanket pillow whatever and plaster it around one of the large room until they create an effective sound barrier in the movie single mattress pull over walkway be an effective sound shield imagine how effective they could be if they put some actual effort into soundproof the room 6 apparently the monster can be kill by shotguns the entire military be wipe out with all the weaponry of the fine military in the world render useless against the monster but emily blunt shoot one in the head and kill it right 7 the mother emily blunt be pregnant why would you bring newborn child into this world when the child will surely jeopardize the safety of the entire family you know that baby cry right pull out or use condom 8 if the monster can hear the faint sound from far way why do they have trouble hear sound that even human can decipher at close range baby cry mother heavy breathe person heartbeat all of these thing would be loud to creature that hear can hear footstep from half mile away 9 the mother water break and she start have the baby she try to contain her gasp and walk downstairs only to step on nail on the stairway she let out sound and fall cause the monster to hunt her down and nearly kill her and the newborn child however just in time she be save by firework design to distract the monster instead of remove the nail like any sane person they just ignore it and leave it stick up on the stair for someone else to step on dumb this movie isn terrible with great act and pretty unique backstory but the glaring logical fallacy and the idiocracy of the character make the movie completely unwatchable for me the monster don really seem that formidable after further inspection and if the family follow any of the tip mention they could live with little difficulty
the true king of the celluloid beast review of king kong it be very long since film have leave me with the same experience of wondrous enthusiasm and awe like felt when star war for the first time then saw screening of peter jackson remake of the daddy of all action adventure king kong in countless interview jackson have say it be king kong that inspire him to become film maker as consequence jackson have approach his project with great affection and care everything that appear on the screen have be craft with consummate skill by jackson and his crew attention to the small detail be evident from the fully flesh out characterisation the choreography of the action sequence to the incredibly life like realisation of kong himself the detailed set computer generate landscape and the wonderful score produce by james newton howard be ingredient which blend harmoniously together to heighten the mood of each and every scene peter jackson version of king kong be not only evidence of his love for the 1993 original and its subject matter it be also triumph of film making and show what skillful director can achieve at the very peak of his game the film deserve position along side the lord of the ring trilogy as his best cinematic achievement to date jackson also allow the visual effect to serve the story instead of engulf it detailed set and computer generate landscapes create an atmosphere which serve to heighten the drama actor andy serkis and motion capture technology be use as tool in invest kong with the ability to exhibit personality and realistic emotion and not just serve as wow factor visual that jump around trash thing this allow for much more realistic engagement between kong and ann darrow naomi watt that certainly be not possible in the 1993 original peter jackson version of king kong be not only evidence of his love for the 1993 original and its subject matter it be also triumph of film making and show what skillful director can achieve at the very peak of his game the film deserve position along side the lord of the ring trilogy as his best cinematic achievement to date if you count yourself among the minority that didn catch king kong at the cinema then highly recommend that you rent copy out at your local video store because you will thoroughly enjoy it
one word travesty before see _the battle of the five armies_ today tell people the first two film lack fidelity to the book but this one should be good figure jackson wouldn have to add lot of extraneous invented action scene because the final third of the book contain plenty of action boy be wrong unnecessary invent character from the previous film continue to take up screen time in this one and many new one be added tolkien wouldn recognize bunch of grand scale evildoer or various good guy whose relationship be suppose to tug at our heart though they turn my stomach instead the addition include plenty of trite dialogue when one invent character in scene make from whole cloth be show weep over loved one and ask why do it hurt so much just about tossed my junior mint meanwhile character largely responsible for turn the tide in the book battle of five army note the lack of the before five be show in the film without explanation for about three second blink and you might miss it when one baddie be apparently kill thought if he suddenly jump up and start fight again m leave too bad didn follow through on my threat after that excruciatingly predictable plot twist do mention that dain confront the elf warrior come across as some nightmare parody of john cleese perform the lord of the fawlty tower could go on but travesty be about the kind word can use for this mass of claptrap now fear that jackson will film _the silmarillion_ turn it into yet another tawdry over the top cgi fest
critical race theory hard at work really could have do without all the force progressive racial narrative
best film of the year m not ben afflick fan but be fan of the 3ds doom destruction and death and think this be 3d film yes it be 3d film but it be so much more in reality the film be about family and you win realize that at first the script be so well craft this film should be use in write class guarantee you will not know what come and after they hit you they re go to hit you again even well truly exceptional write the acting be also exceptional anna kendrick k simmons and jon bernthal really stand out and for bernthal it be change of pace and he carry it off very well jeffrey tambor john lithgow and jean smart do their usual good job you should see this film ve rat nearly 5 000 film and only give 87 rating of 10 that how good think this film be
ground rule double instead of grand slam fun movie to believe director richard linklater spiritual sequel to daze confused you think go to college be free ticket to girls beer and nightly all niter and hey it kind of be right except for the class and the awkwardness or social failing of any kind guess those wouldn have make for such an entertaining movie though all of that be to say that while everybody want some be fun it isn exactly true to life even while offer an authentic look at 1980 era young adulthood the character be baseball team conveniently room in their own pair of off campus quasi frat house there the wide eyed freshman pitcher the upperclassmen who love haze and booze almost as much as they love ball and strike the misfit 30 year old stoner remember this be linklater we re talk about the whipped hick you get the picture it essentially an animal house style ensemble cast where the audience never get chance to tire of any one character in particular further because the writing avoids clichés for the most part each character get few good punchlines and chance to endear himself to the viewer and emphasize him self despite the fact that hear girl chuckle at joke in the theater this movie be basically about boys in college age 18 22 lot of scene about various kind of male bonding others about various form of competition and or one up man ship wouldn go so far as to say the movie be sexist but it certainly bias towards male perspective all of that say the character be like able the apparent protagonist young pitcher by the name of jake all american look blake jenner arrive few day before class at texas university to meet his teammate and new well stocked abode he a nice kid with lot of talent great smile and way with girl just like all his teammate throughout the film he score at the disco entrance young lass at the w bar slam dance at the punk show and just generally ace life he even win the heart of young drama student play by zoey deutch the day before class start talk about an overachiever his teammate run the gamut from witty charm finnegan in an effortlessly funny performance by glen powell to jockish tyler hoechlin mcreynolds great baseball name to be sure to mixture the two the weird character be probably jay juston street an over compensate aggro pitcher who constantly brag about his fastball and major league talent still the team member work well and play off each other and again linklater demonstrate his ability to assemble great cast of mostly unknown actor who not only gel but come off as fun likable dudes the problem be this there no real story some stuff happen mostly fun stuff to be sure but could probably sum up the plot of the movie by say young attractive athlete score chick in variety of situation pretty easily entertaining enough maybe especially if you re hot dude but compare to daze confused or this movie real spiritual partner animal house it come off bit one dimensional the boy go from one party to the next making out well pretty much every time keep wait for the conflict the consequence the part to all the part but it never happen in truth the movie felt like one long first act could almost see this as part of some massive cycle where the next installment would be 90 minute come down bad 2nd date hangover fail class lose season call me cynical but even college kid have bad day or course might be expect too much this movie take place in 1980 and rightly retain lot of the 70s in its look feel so if you judge its story and character by the kind of flick college kid flock to back then porky revenge of the nerd animal house it come off as intelligently write with good performance but even nerd have conflict hell one of bros at animal house partied hard and bed the mayor wife ultimately enjoy this movie might even be into sequel if it promise little more character depth and story arc that actually er arc everybody want some be good time and not much more from different director that might be enough but from linklater it feel like ground rule double instead of grand slam

waste of great concept 4 10 review this movie be not even close to the original oldboy but it watchable and the storyline have many twist which keep it interesting josh brolin put in an excellent performance but it the storyline that let the movie down if spike lee would have give the movie different name and stay away from the original the movie wouldn have be that bad but the whole shock value from the original be go so spike lee have to add in few new element which just didn work also think that josh brolin wasn the perfect choice for the leading role because of his all american brutal act style which be far from the character who play the original role but that not to say that he didn give it his all anyway the film be watchable and intense throughout but expect well from such great concept watchable round up judging by the money that this movie make it seem like people be stay away from spike lee movie nowadays because of his political view and the amount of argument that he have have in hollywood back in the day his movie be very pro black and he have certain type of audience that always rush to see his movie but he have even lose that audience of late hence the box office taking for this film the question be will he ever be take seriously again anyway josh brolin really push his act skill to the limit with this film and it a shame that he didn get the prop that he deserve the weight lose and the mad fighting scene show that he be really take this role seriously but the script let him down would watch it again just for his performance but the movie in whole be poor budget 30million worldwide gross 5million terrible recommend this movie to people who be familiar with the original oldboy which be about man whose lock in room 20 year 4 10

a timeless piece of filmmaking just recently have chance to re watch this film in cinemaplex not exactly imax but it be large screen than my home tv and theatre audio be superb saw this film when it originally come out in theater in 1998 the opening sequence gain notoriety for it unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence have watch this film few time since then but see it on large screen have an appreciation for the realism that spielberg insist on if it be virtually any other filmmaker the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happen instead we would have be present something not as noteworthy these effort be the reason it win several academy award there be so much depth to the story the film zip along with small set piece that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war not only be there some classic performance there be classic face bryan cranston vin diesel matt damon paul giamatti ted danson tom sizemore adam goldberg giovanni ribisi dennis farina barry pepper very recognizable face tom hank now less of an list star compare to the 90s give very natural performance he shout command as confident captain take part in the most incredible feat attempt by our country we get to witness these event partially through the gun shy eye of corp upham play by meek look jeremy davis he react as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos he flinch as much as anyone would with bomb go off right next to you he also represent the humane approach to the war which of course go against reason at time there be accolade to go around include detailed script capt miller unknown career back in the state search through pile of dogtags glider land that go fubar genuinely funny anecdote about the ryan brother before the war coherent explanation of strategy and improvised weapon when confront with dilemma the script smartly explore it to find piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from so we get history lesson about the first few day of the day invasion while be entertain with believable and memorable character the cinematography can be consider landmark in visceral storytelling the use of high shutter speed remove the normal blur when there be an explosion in this case the explosion particle be vividly in focus and feel all the more real and lethal lose track when watch the more technical aspect of the film of how many shot be do in single take in the final battle there be shot follow upham from cower from an explosion track him to another building on another block with tank soldier approach return back to the previous street and end with conversation with sgt horvath sizemore there be many more long shot like this throughout the film that go unnoticed the shot be stag so well they feel like documentary with no deliberate use of shaky cam need lastly the density of the soundtrack must be note there be never end barrage of gunfire explosion object fly in the air footstep weapon be load and on the immersion of the sound again with the advantage of hear it on well tune sound system in theatre make the experience even more intense such as the quiet rumble of german tank approach the spare music score give the perfect backing when the moment require it the 2 hour and 49 minute run time go quickly with each set piece as part of the journey provide something new and intriguing as the squad of soldier encounter the war the long script give character depth and glance at small detail that might have be otherwise excise for time give this film 9 out of 10 and be not only one of spielberg all time best film but timeless work on it own how would rate it as one of the best war film would put it up there with perhaps patton but believe that every well make film about war can each provide unique insight into war such as apocalypse now be one the best war film in the way it show the perversity of war
a portrait of revenge and all that it entail be somewhat mystify by the reputation of get carter as cult classic to me this be portrait of revenge and the self destructive effect that it have upon the perpetrator who basically transmogrify into his enemy by deign to conduct himself as he do and worse in this case the angry carter seek to avenge his brother murder but end up whack everyone and his sister girlfriend and other random associate along the way pretty unsettling and more statement of the killer derange mental state than anything else near the end he be even start to resemble henry lee lucas bit he who live by the gun dy by the gun be essentially the moral of this story or if you like what go around come around or perhaps violence breed violence there be nothing noble whatsoever in this kill spree do aver that michael caine do pretty good job in the role of someone suffer from serious big time ocd with major idée fixe express only in the medium of yet more homicide too bad he wasn a poet instead

light camera distraction when much too wordy for dead guy narrator william holden tell us about the dark ominous mansion he happen upon the direction and atmosphere doesn match up he could be walk up to drugstore in the middle of busy intersection and it be equally as suspenseful perhaps the best thing about the outrageously overrate sunset boulevard be it a monster movie and in that terrifyingly creepy gloria swanson make up for bland and overly glib holden who outside the main location have flirtatious affair with cute ducky lipped nancy olsen as part of soapy hollywood satire melodrama that simply isn thrill enough to be call thriller and it definitely not film noir if anything sunset be satire on hollywood by hollywood with its build in gripe not very universal lot like another hollywood satire consider classic as well decades later also star william holden both be vastly overrate
convolute famous writer director bill wilder say if you be tell complicate story you have to tell it in simple way he be right this film want to be funny and savvy and meaningful those be all great goal but it doesn really achieve them the story telling be as spastic as the camera work be jerky and the more it try to make the back room dealing of corrupt bank make sense the less it do another key thing be that our main character goal be to profit from the impend doom of the economy and though few moment be suppose to make us care about them we really don they still come off as amoral socially odd business men out to make bank so why do we care we don the attempt at hip comedy fail and be distract character suddenly talk to the camera directly to the audience celebrity cameos try to explain what go on these be just distraction guess they want an almost michael moore type vibe but in more fictional type presentation it especially frantic on the big screen almost headache inducing during some of the 20 sec flash cut montage scene that keep pop up it great the director want to go for real movie that he doesn succeed be too bad for effort as they say do not mean he get an
a nutshell review in the land of blood and honey there something in the air these day with military related history base drama about conflict hit our shore all at the same time there act of valor and its war on terror against fictional opposition and both 5 day of war and the land of blood and honey take on look back at the 2008 russo georgian conflict and the 1992 1995 bosnian war respectively weave fictional story in front of an historical backdrop the former align itself close to an action film and this one be more dramatic take that deal with forbidden romance write direct and co produce by angelina jolie one wonder what go through her thought process when she decide to take up duty and responsibility from behind the camera instead of in front of it and to have one directorial feature debut deal with such heavy topic about genocide sexual violence and the inner beast that mankind have the propensity to turn into when fight for beliefs regardless whether right or wrong suppose be un ambassador have expose her to various peacekeeping and charitable cause around the globe and something must have trigger that spark within her to come up with troubled romance story set amidst one of the bad time in human history she doesn shy away from graphic portrayal of the many atrocity commit by the aggressor and show how humanity can crumble into nonchalance through murky politics and when it decide to sit back from the outside and do nothing that the macro picture and the film balance it with micro look at more personal level through the eye of the protagonist serbian danijel goran kostic and bosnian ajla zana marjanovic who begin the film look very optimistic and expectant of her date with the former at time of peace and tranquility if not for bomb blast to signal the end of harmony and prelude of the unimaginable and inexplicable violence to come not before long the land be plunge into civil war with bosnian civilian bear the brunt of it in what would be genocide and ethnic cleansing as it turn out ajla and her family become victim while as fate would have it for danijel to actually be serbian captain under the strict uncompromising order from his military father and their path to cross when ajla get arrest and force into labour in camp if not for danijel to come to her aid claim her to be his property to starve off any sexual advance from his men the romance here be something that drift into mediocrity with this protection accord not go down well amongst the rank and danijel get into love hate relationship of sort with ajla where in time much good than the present would have evolve into something more beautiful than forceful it an open secret love affair that grow and bring to life only by zana marjanovic strong performance as woman out to survive her ordeal marjanovic brings about balance in both vulnerability and steely strength in her character of ajla who have to decide on her emotion whether or not she can literally fall in love and be sleep with the enemy while kostic own performance deal with the ability to show compassion or be seduce by master slave power that overwhelms and slowly but surely corrupts and spiral into obsessive suspicion and paranoia what become more intriguing as the narrative wore on be the similarity with ang lee lust caution in the second half of the film where woman find herself task to do job to make stand for the oppressed and her people give her natural charm and close proximity to do so the conflict of emotion and the suspense especially since how scheme sans detail get moot serve as an inflection point and will leave you guess whether will she or win she and even then how it can actually all take place since she isolate almost all the time in fortified location and we aren in the clear of any detail if any be discuss at all give the apparent vagueness the final scene between danijel and ajla be intense and will serve as talk point give the quick convenient and inevitable way to closure but like 5 day of war this film be fairly lop side in its politics so focus not on that but on the relationship that be romeo and juliet ish involve star cross lover from opposite side of the land try to keep the flickering flame of their love affair alive amongst the chaos and destruction around them
one of the most important and influential action film of all time the heist be landmark action film it be surprising that it be so overlooked it loom large over the film action genre over the past two decade almost every action film owe something to this remarkable masterpiece by peckinpah at the the height of his directorial power for starter the garbage compactor scene be directly lift by george lucas in star war the dialogue pacing and edit be stamp all over tarantino film the action sequence be the start point for john woo triad masterpiece few movie that bear out the direct influence include point break which the story and action sequence be similar as well as ben affleck the town the script by then up and come walter hill base upon jim thompson novel be perfection in itself in fact all of hill movie can be tie in one way or another to his screenplay in the getaway in fact don think it a stretch to say the brash direction and machismo be define influence on takeshi kitano directorial career by all mean if you be film lover and have not see this one you be indeed lucky to be able to see it for the first time usually peckinpah be define by critic with his film the wild bunch and by general consensus consider it his best after see this film it be no long true for me this be peckinpah fine hour mcqueen show why he be still regard as legend simply unforgettable performance
omg cheesy and awkward isn enough to describe this do not believe any of the act it be just surreal
entertain but bit messy bird of prey show that dc have finally right the ship after several early stumble in this franchise by focus on small more personal story with more personal stake bird of prey be very entertaining movie albeit one with some irritate flaw firstly cathy yan direct the hell out of this movie she really know how to frame an exciting action scene with nice wide full body shot to show off the great stunt work the movie style and colour pallet be very eye catching and visually interesting margot robbie continue to be excellent as this franchise version of harley quinn and ewen mcgregor look like he have the time of his life as sleazy but intimidate villain most of the movie problem for me come from the script the first half be very messy as the movie bounce around and move back and forth in rashomon attempt that really didn work and kind of annoyed me once an action scene in police evidence locker take place though the movie calm down considerably and be lot more watchable also while the other member of the cast and the villain be entertain to watch they only have only surface level characterisation seemingly interest on the surface but not really much underneath some ardent bird of prey fan may be disappoint in the lack of actual bird of prey give about 85 of this be harley quinn movie which lead me to wonder if they side the bird of prey name for brand recognition only in conclusion bird of prey be fun colourful time at the movie but some serious screenplay flaw prevent it soar to the height of the dceu but it comfortably pitch high above the trainwreck that be suicide squad
blah blah bland have see this because of its rave critical review find myself leave the cinema very dishearten the story start well but get somewhat lose amidst its attempt to uphold its reputation as musical and its seemingly convolute story line song remain forgettable as the viewer become distract by one or another on screen event such as the starry night waltz to me the opening number be seemingly bit too forced and become more of light hearten joke than hook for the audience ryan gosling sing in some area be somewhat questionable whilst emma stone hidden talent be practice and display in agreeable manner however in comparison with other nominated and critically review film la la land somewhat struggle to find its foot with me let alone put on its dancing shoe although it be rather nostalgic and visually very beautiful it take several attempt for me to even begin to like the soundtrack let alone tolerate the film although do not like the film personally believe that element within the film such as its plot twist end be very well construct and arguably save the film just overall not horrendous view but perhaps not film to binge watch repeatedly on rainy day
nice effect with paper thin plot and dialog to match this be the most disappointing of the three while number two have its fault nothing compare to the third installment the plot be paper thin and the dialog be campy m surprise the actor could deliver them with straight face the end be confuse mess while don believe that neat and tidy ending be necessary do believe in well thoughtout ending the only thing carry throughout the trilogy be the special effect this series start out with such promise but it fail to deliver outside of the first one it make me long for the star war series
i love it when plan come together simple short review the team be easily one of the best summer movie make it know what it be and what it isn it doesn try to be anything else and some of the most fun ve have at the movie in long time on top of some great action sequence that leave people cheer the crowd also laugh non stop bradly cooper comedic timing be excellent this one be worth check out bring your friend they do the show justice and will introduce young generation to great show carnahan put together great movie which easily could have go the way of starsky hutch or charlies angel have fun
review the movie not the director people be lose their mind over the sainted director forget the movie sure it well make fascinate history but it second nature for de niro and pacino overreaches at time the third reel be repetitive over the decline of the de niro character would be good movie at 2hr 30 in fact think it have end about then but it meander on another hour
long silence same thing for over 1h wort movie ever see just don understand how good actress like scarlett johansson accept this awful scenario this be the only movie where you don need to understand english to be able to watch it because nobody speak dame word you have to wait exactly 94mn to be able to see some action and understand what be really go on and again in total silence really awful movie from it look like retarded producer can imagine why they need star of johansson magnitude for this low budget trash nor can imagine why she take the role the specie movie cover the storyline more thrillingly and more viscerally if this be mean to be pretentious art house film about an alien predate on alienated member of scottish society all can say be it definitely alienate me
batman begin and continue to bore for over 2 hrs win take too much time from this unbelievably enthusiastic crowd to state all the reason find this flic so slow and tedious but have to state quickly that find the 3 young actor to be the most lame and wimpiest of any in the batman series even though think val kilmer be total farce luckily katie holmes get big diamond from tom cruise this m at the eiffel tower so her future may not be too dependent upon her acting ability christian bale be definitely not believable as have class and polish in his role of young millionaire also do anyone else think cillian murphy would be good one to cast in young bo derek role just throw long blonde wig on him and he could pass for what she look like in the mid 80 ok so he need build up bra and some long legs thank goodness for popcorn morgan freeman ruttger hauer and gary oldman at least didn fall completely asleep
waste of time find this movie very bore will not spoil the movie however would say that would not see this movie again find this movie very slow and very boring think this movie lack direction and end within the first couple minute you easily figure out that lou be psycho but other than that there be no real plot twist find the end very disappointing and lacking closure there be several good television show that would like to recommend if you enjoy the psychotic crime drama dexter and blacklist be two of them both show be very good and be much good use of your time than this movie
great scene mix in with 2 hr of put me to sleep cinema personally felt this movie be entirely too long know thats probably be say to death but for one couldn wait for him to fall and the movie to end be huge fan of epic if you look on the list of my favorite film more than half be epic can set through 3 hr movie with no problem if its great movie but for some reason couldn stay interested in this movie ll admit there be scene that be awesome but everything in between those scene almost put me to sleep peter jackson can do some amazing thing but he take good 1 1 2hr movie and make it sleeper of 3 hr movie jackson can create scene that can absolutely enthrall you at the same time though there be so much of this movie that could have be easily edit out king kong obviously doesn have the story that the lord of the ring trilogy have there just isn enough entertaining story to make 3 hr movie out of it seem to me that jackson be under lot of pressure to make huge 3 hr plus epic that he couldn just make the movie how it need to be make
a movie with awful pacing and muddle philosophical message really hate it when don enjoy classic film really want to enjoy it but just can i want to understand some people love for it but just can metropolis fall under this category an unbearably slow film watch the restoration which be over 2 hour long that may have be bad idea that start off with interesting idea but then seem to not really do much with them it be the year 2026 the wealthy rule the city of metropolis while the low class work for hour on end underground in awful condition the master of metropolis be joh fredersen alfred abel and his son be freder gustav frohlich who spend his day with other rich people in place call the pleasure garden where he truly do nothing at all woman name maria brigitte helm bring group of work child up for visit in pleasure garden and freder be quickly enamor by maria freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shock as an explosion go off and kill multiple worker he report this to his father who be disappoint his son be the first to report it over his assistant josepha theodor loo and his assistant be quickly fire this do an immediate job of show the coldness of joh but they never do much else with his character in fact very little of the character be develop in anyway most of them be completely uninteresting and the set itself be compel at first but quickly lose anything interesting halfway through the film as the film move at snail pace anyways the main aspect of the plot here be that the worker be lead by maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of mediator to make it happen my real issue be that the film start with such great idea and have potential to become something like 1984 m aware it come out afterwords and that it a novel but still just an example but it instead become fill with strange religious allusion and becomes witch hunt essentially by the end they never really do any decent social commentary at all if any at all this wouldn matter if the film be actually entertaining but it only be in spurt and then quickly become repetitive bore do think the special effect be impressive and this film be obviously important for be the first full length science fiction film well ever that doesn mean it hold up because it doesn in fact it be hard for me to believe the film be entertain in 1927 still wonder if have watch the short version of the film how much more would ve enjoy the film it certainly would ve have be pace well consider so much of this film be unbelievably uninteresting but don think that change the fact that this movie doesn really do anything it isn entertain it doesn really have message what be this movie guess good special effect for 1927 whatever m glad give this classic chance but highly doubt ll revisit it anytime soon
holy grail always feel like m one of the very few not in love with monty python and the holy grail ve see it few time and just never have the uproarious laughter that everyone else seem to experience still despite not love it myself can certainly recognize that there be clever pertinent and prescient commentary on the world it also impossible to ignore the pop cultural impact it have the movie be so quotable that there a good chance lot of people quote it without even have see it and that just impressive
a little over the top but it all good after be really happy with the first hot shot be excite to see the next and have to say that part deux be still ton of fun despite the fact that know that this film may be little silly and over the top with the joke it still be lot of fun to watch think everyone need an outrageous comedy here and there charlie sheen be an absolute blast to watch this time they be take on rambo predator commando basic instinct and many other reference topper be ask to come back to save bunch of american soldier capture by saddam husain but he have be dump by ramada and start steamy affair with cia agent who give him her mole for luck when he see ramada on the mission due to sequel cast they stick together and the team put in their best and save the soldier from the wacky dictator hot shot part deux be lot of fun for certain people like me who enjoy these zany goof ball comedy really do prefer this kind of comedy to many ve see today where it more shock than originality the hot shot movie be so much fun and would recommend these movie for anyone just sit back and have fun with these comedy think you ll have good time 7 10
all that matter be the end result and wouldn even give it an for effort although it really try to be as clever as it can be this actually work against the movie the twist isn really twist unless you be one of the main character in the movie who seem to think about quite lot of thing but not about the one main thing that be actually happen and the clever concept be too weak full of illogical story and character moment m not talk about the mistake you ll come up after you watch movie because you can do that with any movie but about the really crazy stuff that you will notice during the movie start from crazy park spot to handbag to the many convenient thing that seem to happen just like that this go beyond suspend your disbelief again the fact that it try to be clever just work against it the whole time
nora the show have go downhill since nora join the cast she be not likeable character and be immature and childish

faithful adaptation that lack any soul of the original watchman be in many way faithful even love adaptation of alan moore graphic novel zack snyder reproduce many of the scene especially early in the film almost shot for shot from the book most of the major plot point from the book at least those involve the main character make it into the movie the thing which be edit from the book long sequence of rorschach veidt and silk specter pasts the plot line with support character the black freighter sequence largely make certain kind of sense as the thing you cut snyder also do an excellent job of establish the mood of the alternate history and the backstory of the superheroes through great opening credit montage but the film lack any real soul none of the performance stand out matthew goode manages to make ozymandias more human than he be in the book at least until the end jackie earle haley have moment of snarl greatness near the end but that about it patrick wilson brings nothing to the role of night owl and billy crudup tepid delivery harm the portrayal of dr manhattan snyder edit out of the secondary character while make sense in regard to run time ultimately blunt the impact of the film climax furthermore snyder be obviously of rather juvenile sensibility when it come to storytelling while he cut out many moment of character development he actually increase the time allot to violence the book be not actually that violent and most of the more gruesome act happen off camera in snyder watchman we re treat to extremely gory disintegration and extend slow mo fight scene which serve to show off his cool camera technology but do nothing to advance the film there also two instance where snyder take line from the book and rather than have them deliver by the actual character have them deliver as heresay by another one in the final case this dramatically blunt one of the central message of the film ultimately make the line just an offhanded quip oddly give the apocalyptic end the film really have no emotional payoff
funny and touch but not all it could or should be french language base on true story drama the intouchables be touch but not as good as it like to think it be in the mind of its creator it seem to be comic drama of immense human significance in reality it be powerful and affect and funny at different time it also clichéd patronising and predictable it the story of rich privilege quadriplegic man who need to hire new carer he pick young man with no qualification and no experience from the paris housing project what follow be predictable but still effective clash of culture and expectation with mutual learn take place on both side of the divide the film seem at pain to not offend with its sensitive subject matter the overall effect seem to be at time patronise to the poor and the disabled alike all poor people like hip hop it seem all the rich classical music the quadriplegic man struggle to feel you see yes really all bit trite at time at others be affect though it chime with me at point it encourage an engaging counter cultural lack of safety and wisdom the good to actually build meaningful life and relationship to break artificial barrier and self limitation it encourage kind of holy recklessness on its viewer that you suspect will get lose amidst the worthiness for many if only the film itself have show little more danger and little less safety we could have have something more special and less crowd pleasing
a flat ride the immigrant have all the ingredient to be blockbuster and an excellent movie great actor fantastic production great atmosphere historical setting and touch story about the harshness of immigration in the usa after the ww1 without sugar coat b yet for whatever reason the movie felt flat most of the time to me and not touch despite the story be priori very touch phoenix be always great in whatever he do and he the only actor whose character felt and believe to be real in this film marion cotillard be really sweet but despite the role be write for her the dramatic coloratura of the script speaking in polish and shed the perfect tear her acting feel flat as if she have take muscular relaxant during the film unfortunately didn think her acting be come from the heart and it didn touch mine find jeremy renner miscast in his role he have no chemistry with cotillard on camera and he be never mean to be rival of the always powerful phoenix the script have no tempo unfortunately so it drag me alone on two hour flat ride you know the movie be really sad and emotional but it rarely move me intrigue me or keep me wait for what be come next the movie felt depending of the time clichéd phony overly melodramatic bit frigid but mostly unfocused and confused and that always the director fault overall this be nice film to watch but it deflate before it get fully inflate there be many thing like about this film truly but nothing really love unfortunately
pretty basic people complain about the forced racism bad message need to recognise what really wrong with this show the plot be basic as anything it a team up superhero show and unlike stuff like guardian of the galaxy it lack bunch in the personality bracket stuff like this be the reason people can take superhero film or tv show seriously yet and when they have an interesting concept they end up ruin it with really easy to watch fight scene which this show have plenty of the annoy thing be they can get it right infinity war be amaze but they hardly try sometimes because you can barely critique them without hear thing like but it just fun kid movie or just turn your brain off to it please marvel actually do something with this captain america bad version that not just 1 dimensional bad guy or make him become one of the bad terrorist people scarryyyy before last minute he say actually m good guy because that what my dead friend would have want and you ll all forgive me for kill man
black and white picture of the world in the land of blood and honey pass almost unnoticed among viewer and critic alike except in the country that emerge from the former yugoslavia where it create considerable controversy in order to understand this we have to explain the history of balkan and origin of civil war that lead to the collapse of yugoslavia but even the executive summary of such story would take up more time than angelina jolie feature film directorial debut so if you ignore historical background and accuracy this be essentially bad movie the script be idiotic and act mediocre in order to make the movie more realistic the character talk in english with local dialect this might be convince to the average viewer but sound stupid to anyone who know this part of the world the only good thing be the atmosphere at the beginning of the conflict where most of the people believe the war would be over in matter of week find it remarkable that star like angelina jolie devote her time to humanitarian work and tell the world the untold story of human suffering at the same time it be regrettable that such story be bias accord to the current dogma envision by international politics and medium accord to that it be crystal clear who the good guy be and they should be absolve from all wrongdoing on the other hand for the supposed misdeed of the bad guy the whole population of their country should be punish until eternity this be black and white image of the world which in my opinion be against the founding principle of unhcr where angelina jolie hold distinguish post
this be waste of time you see be okay with this be racist toward white ppl not problem it just movie and be okay with the rip off but what can just ignore the fact that the end be sooo pathetic so you want to tell that they have camera in place where they lock him down and they decide not to use it don they know how much time they have before him wake up and for some reason he just wake up and start kill everyone and everything like the end be just soooooo trash oh boi what waste of time this be

absurdly overrate this movie be absurdly overrate by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompany by lush score be synonymous with aesthetic brilliance the direction be nothing to write home about the cinematography be frankly standard the script have steven king write all over it melodramatic plot involve the woe of an educate bloke tell in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphor good example the moment when the scriptwriter decide that the prisoner interest in geology have to be spell out for the dumb member of the audience it all about time and pressure just in case anyone manage to miss the connection morgan freeman be as usual superb but tim robbins be inconsistent as man who go from be the gaol newcomer to an old hand while the film sympathetic liberal political stance can be commend it certainly not great work of art 3

superb film but it require viewer to slown down pay attention and think after dominic francesco carnelutti priest who be one of the last of the carolingian order dy of an apparent suicide the other two remain carolingian alex bernier heath ledger and thomas garret mark addy come to rome to learn what happen while there they discover that something much more sinister be afoot can see why the order would have difficulty be commercially successful and that too bad because this be an excellent film the problem lead to commercial struggle be that writer director brian helgeland create very intelligent script that assume the viewer do not need everything spell out to them this be film that open by place us in the middle of complex world with deep history so that we have to pay attention and do bit of detective work to get up to speed initially the script be full of unexplained reference to belief and tradition of the catholic church and order such as carolingian and jesuit it be densely pack with clever dialogue subtle pun and other kind of literary device and reference it use and some understanding of the film depend on occasional phrase in latin aramaic french and italian although most of the important word and phrase be translate for us this be not light popcorn movie and it be slow burner if you be not to fully pay attention and actively think about the film you could easily become lost or confuse the performance be superb alex thomas mara sinclair shannyn sossamon william eden benno furmann and driscoll peter weller all seem like real people with complex personality and back story visually helgeland creates and sustain an incredible eerie atmosphere throughout the film it so remarkable that repeat view focus only on the production design cinematography and composition would be very reward the music by david torn one of my favorite modern composer and musician be exceptional and the relatively sparse visual effect be beautiful well place and appropriately surreal the story be captivate and become more so as it continue it be wonderfully gray about its subject matter when it count this be film that not only bear but demand repeat viewing but you have to be able to slow down and think while view don expect action set piece although there be couple minor bit of action gorefest or mtv style edit the end of the order cry out for sequel but not because the end be at all incomplete or because there be monster who just wouldn die however give that the film only gross fraction of its 38 million dollar budget those of us who be fan of this film will have to keep our finger cross 10 out of 10 from me
poor kevin poor me be excite to see kevin bacon star in something new but this be just something old and moldy don understand how movie like this even get make there be nothing new here it just jumble of scene that don mean much in movie that be suppose to be horror mystery like so many not even up to mediocre film keep expect this to get good and instead it just bore they throw in all this melodrama that add nothing instead of building suspense and interest by the climax if you could call it that be nod off and figure out the film secret early on the best thing can say be kevin bacon be still an attractive man but this be huge disappointment unless you really need to see him this isn worth watch this isn even as well do as your average low budget horror film in 2020 shadow on the wall just do not cut it
poor film making and lazy writing normally when you see blockbuster come out in august it usually mean that the movie isn that great that seem to be the case here because gi joe be very bad it a movie but it can hardly even be call movie because it essentially be just an elaborate toy commercial as you can see when the hasbro logo be show before the film this be actually the second movie to be produce by hasbro this summer after transformer revenge of the fall in june there also seem to be consistent pattern that the bad movie this year have be hasbro production if you re expect to see direct adaptation of the gi joe cartoon then that not what you re go to get here this be an upgrade in technology and that could actually be quite entertain for the first hour of the film it a big problem when you could tell that lot of work be put into the special effect and not so much on the character development honestly couldn care for anyone in this movie and it didn help that they be so annoy the plot be very simple basically all you need to know be that there be two side gi joe v cobra and they be fight against each other you be easily able to identify who be on which side the movie be direct by stephen sommers that previously do the mummy the mummy return and van helsing actually haven see any of the movie in the mummy series but have see van helsing and do like it the first time saw it when watch it recently it be actually quite dull so he isn exactly great director guess can briefly talk about the performance you can expect the acting in gi joe to be anything special in fact it quite terrible no one be believable with these remarkably cheesy line from the script even dennis quaid didn impress me in this suppose this be flaw that would be blame on the writer rather than the actor do know that channing tatum be terrible in anything that he in marlon waylons be also in it do the comic relief think that he be funny at time but mostly his joke and just fell flat can say more about the performance that hasn already be mention the special effect in gi joe be actually quite good at time but it look very fake at other time still it save it from become complete disaster could say that hated every scene in the movie with the exception of the paris scene which be the most fun have with gi joe and people seem to agree with me on that and of course it end with character hold gun and walk towards the camera because it a stereotypical brainless action movie to conclude this review m go to give gi joe the rise of cobra 4 10 still if you be fan of brainless action movie you might actually like gi joe the rise of cobra but still be very bad in my opinion
quite possibly the bad film m ever see this be quite possibly the bad film ve ever see the act in most place be often terrible the directing editing be also terrible far too many half speed shot and poorly execute montage with lack of coherent shot the special fx the airport bomb scene be comically bad and the sound effect for the fight scene be also comical could go on and on how this be in the top 250 imdb film be beyond me whilst watch we be unsure whether the film be mean to be satirical perhaps the only redeeming factor be the soundtrack and the somewhat interesting moral dilemma raise in the protagonist 10 minute nonsensical monologue do not bother watch this
not ve be content to lurk and learn on this web site for month but after read the ream of glow critique of this film felt obligate to get an imdb account and print contrary point of view the shawshank redemption be an obvious thinly characterize visually uncompelling film whether it the good guy bad guy cliche or the white guy black guy cliche it still the same old hollywood this be not film which discover life through enigmas dilemma and reflection it be film which wear its rather plain message on its sleeve 3 out of 10 for prison flick try dancer in the dark someone else recommend alternative prison flick kiss of the spider woman and cool hand luke heartily agree with those choice 4
too wacky and boring feminazi vibe with crazy laugh here and there jump and scream here and there be it actually movie or just not funny long skit hard to tell
take too long to get go but then be good heard of king kong but never watch any movie until this one and immediately afterwards watch the original one from 1933 the old movie really be like blueprint except they improve lot of thing in the 2005 version and unfortunately also make some thing bad improvement would be the emotional part between kong and ann obviously the added cgi especially in the important scene with kong and the production overall what be make worse be the length 3 hour be too long for this one or the love story between jack and ann which overshadow the connection between ann and kong also didn enjoy the first half of the movie as much as do the second one there be lot of thing go on which either weren believable or elongate some character didn have the right personality or maybe it just that would ve enjoyed other actor for some role more daniel day lewis as carl denham for example paul dano as preston or jimmy could put up whole list now but guess it would contain too many star in one movie which also would be unrealistic it a decent remake have it good moment but it not perfect either
not for me this be generally well make movie be into it for while but be so unsatisfied when it finish pretty creepy with few scary moment fairly low entertainment factor 1 view 1 4 2021
an idiotic melodrama for teen half wit and teen half wit movie keep get more idiotic and the audience just get more brain dead by watch them anyone over the age of 15 who give this movie good review probably still live with their parent eats peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch and be still virgin this movie be asinine juvenile and just plain derivative there be so many film this movie have copy that be so much good it be almost pointless to watch it the teenage melodrama that exude from this stinker be like the crow with big acne pimple if you think this be good film try watch brazil the director cut of blade runner or even 1984 not great but masterpiece when compare to this crap this be not as bad as sin city my vote for the bad film of 2005 but it have so much sucky teen angst that it will make you want to buy slurpee and ride bmx my verdict for vendetta be total crap with script that seem to have be write by grade 9 student with an inferiority complex avoid this film if you be old than 15 and you have an iq above 75

the simpson movie be it worth the wait hmmm the simpson be one of the legit hit phenomenon of the last 20 year ever since it conception in 1989 it wow dazzle and amuse audience with its perfect blend of comedy satire and sharp characterisation america favourite dysfunctional family have become so ingrained in modern pop culture that wonder how long it would be before they emerge onto the big screen and although creator matt groening first hit on the idea of simpson movie way back in 1992 it take far 15 year for the finish result to fully emerge and the big question surely on everyone lip be be it worth the wait m afraid not in spite of all the hype surround it the 11 writer who write the screenplay its lengthy production process and mass expectation the simpson movie come up short in far too many area must admit that in recent year do feel the simpson have lose fair bit of its sparkle there be time when tune into the show with almost religious fervour nowadays only dip in every now and again to give it casual glance the first ten season be pure televise brilliance consistently entertain sharp satire witty as hell but then after season 11 it suddenly begin to lose focus and become increasingly more tired and formulaic and that a problem that infect the simpson movie too the film have plot that really wouldn have look out of place in the tv show homer adopts pet pig that he name spider pig and then later harry plopper funny name cross my mind harry trotter g when he put the pig waste in silo and dump it into springfield lake it pollute the water so badly it start churn out mutant squirrel the epa declare springfield an environmental hazard and encase the town in massive glass dome when the people realise homer responsible for all this he escape with the family and hide out in alaska but when the epa decide to nuke springfield homer realise he must return to clean up the mess he make as sat through the simpson movie laugh aloud exactly five time sad reduction of the comic edge the simpson once have the tv show certainly open up onto the big screen with confidence there be one dazzling moment where the camera glide through an entire lynch mob make up of just about every character from the show bart get bit of full frontal nudity only bit mind you and marge even get cuss word that would have be too extreme for the tv format but for every laugh aloud moment scatter throughout the film you have to wonder why you re not laugh the rest of the time first begin to get sinking feeling about the film within the first five minute when grampa simpson have something like psychic fit while at church he roll around the floor muttering portent and predict doom get the impression this scene be intend as an hysterical set piece but it fall curiously flat didn laugh once in fact if anything the scene feel cringeworthy rather than funny and the rest of the film settle into the same kind of scattershot humour there be many many sight gag too many to recall but where some of them hit the mark others go far off it like the scene where homer discovers alaska be not the way he envision it so he remedy the situation by put up picture of it over the windscreen of his car and he say there that good and one wonderful scene halfway through make the film worth see for this one moment alone marge want to go back to springfield and when homer refuse she pack up the kid and leaf without him marge leaf videotape for him say she reach the end of her tether with him she can just look the other way anymore and turn blind eye to his selfishness and to prove she mean what she say she tap this message over they re wed video its surprisingly tender scene the one moment where the film forgets about try to be funny and instead make strong dramatic statement but the cap on the scene be homer be so devastated that when the scene fade out it follow up with cue card say to be continue immediately an absolutely delightful moment inspire in its creativity laugh for several minute also like homer m escher inspired dream sequence that compel him to do the right thing just wish the rest of the film have some of the same inspiration thing come to satisfy dramatic conclusion but the comedy just doesn come fast enough subplots like lisa get crush on an irish boy and bart see ned flanders as potential father figure feel underdevelop they don really go anywhere and there be disappointingly little of simpson favourite mr burn and principal skinner the simpson feel bit stretch at feature length too there a nice self mock cameo appearance from tom hank but the film isn all that it should have be its easy to say that because the simpson work best as tv show instead of film but the sad truth be the simpson run its course long time ago the film be just as empty as the show have become where it once corner the market of primetime animation the simpson now seem decidedly tame when hold up against the no hold bar material of south park the simpson be spend force you ll probably disagree with that today but in time you ll come to see that m right
nominate for 12 oscar sorry but this movie be terrible you get throw in the movie without any explanation of the story and the character and during the movie this doesn improve what really annoyed me be the fact that the movie be very unrealistic like lot of others user write in their review on imdb leonardo get attack by bear but survive fine but after this it get ridiculous his body be maul and after his friend carry him for about 2 day leo get bury alive but decide to resurrect and find tom hardy who kill his son the rest of the movie be unrealistic bull crap for gullible audience apart from the fact that leo almost eats nothing but be able to move his extremely wound body around amaze me since have be in live threatening situation myself and there be no way that you recover from such injury so fast in the extreme cold and without any food leo also seem untouched by the cold weather and the water because he throw himself in an icy river and when he get out he doesn even shiver normal person would have hypothermia he fall with his horse down huge cliff and survives and when leo get chase by 10 20 indian they all shoot at him but keep miss from close range and leo even fire his flint lock pistol twice without reload come on do nobody notice this cant believe people give this movie such high rating but they must be the people who also think series like the walk dead be worth 10 10

boring and mislead this movie be incredibly bore it also leave out some rather important detail regard what fuel the housing crisis include government back loan low interest rate and why there be lack of financial oversight the scene with the sec character be mislead because the sec doesn regulate mortgage underwriting of commercial bank it doesn now and it never have while the sec regulate mortgage back security it be primarily from consumer protection standpoint the most misleading part be when the movie claim that little have change since the financial crisis in term of regulatory oversight financial regulation have since change significantly bank have to hold much more capital and be prohibit from many activity that be allow during the financial crisis could spend an hour write about what have change since the financial crisis also the bank didn receive blank check like many american tend to believe and this movie insinuate something similar the bailout be in the form of collateralized loan as in the government take ownership of something the bank previously own and give the bank cash why the asset that bank previously use for liquidity be tie up in market that stop function practically overnight over time the market start function again bank repay their loan and bank receive their collateral back from the government that be say the movie be bore especially from someone familiar with the product and industry
high expectation high disappointment support local movie despite the movie be over rat the plot be too dull to be drag for almost 2 hour anyway judge yourselves
one of the most underrated movie ever m disappointed to see that this film still hasn garner the attnention it deserve even back when it come out it do so pretty quietly and be thus bury under other big budget flick rarely though do comedy keep you entertain and laugh throughout pretty much the entire film most comedy try and fail or take break from the humor with someone else to preserve material but ferrell and wahlberg play off of eachother perfectly in this film and have real chemistry to keep the film quality high this be also one of the mostquotable film ever 9 year later and my dad and still shoot off i a peacock captain you get ta let me fly or if be lion and you be tuna d swim out to the middle of the ocean and freakin eat you every once in short while definitely recommend this movie for fan of comedy
from the mind of teenager about 250 year in the future ex soldier korben dallas willis be work as taxi driver when woman come crash through his roof it turn out that this woman leeloo jovovich be actually the fifth element supreme be who when join with four ancient sacred stone represent wind fire water and earth can fight evil which be lucky since evil be come their way in the form of big pulsating planet assist by the impossibly rich tycoon zorg oldman who be try to locate the four stone so that evil can prevail after team up with priest name father vito cornelius holm to find the stone they travel to another planet on behalf of the federation of the united state where they meet up with various alien life form who want to help or harm them and their most frightening encounter of all radio dj ruby rhod tucker truthfully be conflict when it come to my ultimate outlook on this film visually it be completely captivate the set design layer of air traffic in the street of new york go up hundred of story float central park the costume gaultier with his usual m look couture and the colorful hair and makeup be fantastic lot of the contraption mask that instantly do your makeup cigarette machine that dispense cigarette with increasingly long filter for those who be try to quit smoking be clever and entertaining and the overall style of the film be impressive there be certainly some thing that be really odd to me that don really warrant explanation still scratch my head about like what be the deal with gary oldman sound exactly like billy bob thornton but ultimately chalk up to eccentricity there wasn even anything universally wrong with the script think that it be very basic but fun story and like the fact that notorious badass willis wasn so much live up to his reputation until we approach the end of the film unfortunately become more and more irritated with some of the humor mostly slapstick type thing people say w w w w what do you mean bomb and the like think hear w w w w w at least thirty time throughout the film that be be present after view the film discover that besson have actually write this screenplay when he be in high school something that be slightly impressive but actually explain lot in term of the goofiness think the other major irritant be chris tucker completely understand that his character be suppose to be way out there kind of cross between prince and grace jones but think that the weird costume hair and mannerism could have suffice instead have flashback to sit in the theater watch star war episode and literally want to get up and hit something after listen to jar jar binks screech and prattle on tucker high pitch voice and utter lack of charm do not win any point with me and if anything he make the film lose at least one point on my rating scale other than the aforementioned thing there wasn a whole lot to dislike about the fifth element but there wasn really anything to get excite about either if this film didn have the obnoxious chris tucker in it would consider it to be great popcorn flick instead even while just mentally flash back to some of his scene begin to feel like drill be near my ear however because the film be fairly enjoyable other than his scene give it 5 10 shelly
original die hard 5 script ok so since get to sleep on it olympus have fall be pretty good solid action flick little crazy with the cgi as usual in today modern action movie could not help but wonder whether this be the original script for die hard 5 all they would have have to do be have john mcclane tour the white house and the t hit the fan so many parallel between this and the original die hard like the stereotypical terrorist who try to fake their own death at the end just to name one but seriously it be like watch rip of die hard without john mcclane but gerard butler save the movie from be complete rip off and it turn out to be an average action flick only by modern standard this movie wouldn hold light to the 80s gem such as predator terminator and die hard or basically anything with stallone or arnie
one of 2015 best film adam mckay the big short be the best financial movie have see since watch oliver stone wall street 1987 but the only difference between these two movie be that this movie be base on true event the film take place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspect of this movie be pretty funny if you ask me the movie be adapt from the book by michael lewis and it basically start off with dr michael burry christian bale who be the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually bet against the housing market before it actually happen despite everyone else think that he be crazy person then 20 minute into the film we see banker name jared vennett ryan gosling talk to morgan stanley employee name mark baum steve carell and his coworkers and vennett tell them that not long from now the economy be go to collapse and that nobody be even talk about it also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversation baum be go through personal tragedy that will not reveal in this review for those people that haven see the movie and baum be get comfort between phone call and at home by his wife marisa tomei the screenplay for this movie by mckay along with charles randolph take home the oscar last year for best adapt screenplay and have few minor gripe with it here and there but then again it be direct by man who normally do comedy then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world john magaro and finn wittrock end contacting retire trader by the name of ben rickert brad pitt who be the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market the only major problem have with this movie be the shaky camera angle which could have be improve on and also think that adam mckay could have be more impartial instead of openly mock the corporation but then again that be just my opinion but otherwise the performance from bale who get an oscar nomination gosling carell and pitt be top notch as well as marisa tomei this be one of last year great achievement in film and stand by this review
with an all star cast couldn avoid watch this let me state firstly that this be not the kind of movie generally watch ve never be attract to dungeon dragon style fantasy with burt reynolds as noble king ray liotta as the evil magician jason statham as the orphan farmer hero and leelee sobieski as the fly in the ointment felt oblige to give it try all of these and more actor give splendid performance the overall production be excellent and the movie flow along at good pace the story be nothing new but interesting enough none the less it provide me with 2 5 hour of entertainment so give it 7 10
nicely craft but ultimately superficial and disappoint the problem with this movie be its gimmick it rely on the concept of benjamin button reverse age to stand out but yet throughout the nearly three hour runtime this very concept be never explore in any depth when benjamin be ask what it like to grow young he give bland response about only be inside himself look out likewise all the people benjamin encounter seem to immediately adapt natural acceptance of his condition call him unusual and leave it at that which do little to add to the immersion of the movie oh so you can fly breathe underwater and lift locomotive oh my what an unusual boy you be in fact so little effect do this reversed age process have which have undoubtedly become the main attention gatherer for this film that you could essentially do away with the entire idea and it would come out just about the same story about man who be shun as newborn grow up under somewhat poor condition go out on see the world adventure and return home and eventually develop dementia and die it not exactly poor story but neither be it very remarkable an ordinary extraordinary life story if you will forrest gump do this in good way already as several reviewer have point out the one thing to make this movie different be the reversed aging but as say that issue never really get any screen time no one question its cause no one contemplate its implication and even benjamin himself doesn really have anything to say about it so in the end the one thing that could have make this movie interest end up as sideshow it like go to see movie about alien and out space and realize it actually standard love story that be do 100 time before only in an out space set that never really touch upon with an alien cameo somewhere in the middle guess this be always the intention of the people behind the film but it just doesn appeal to me have the courage to focus on the part of your idea that be unique instead of desperately cling to the warm common ground of relationship and love so that everyone can relate to it
great disappointment seem to be almost alone in not like this movie find it generally lack the depth of the book not surprising as it would be quite impossible to condense the immense amount of material in the book to movie however long however enter it fully expect thing to change unfortunately just find rather poorly do movie some aspect be wonderful yes the visuals be spot on for the most part the effect be stun with few exception but the script oh the script my big problem be the general simplification of thing the incredible mystery of the book the sense that what start out as simple adventure be actually vastly large story be quite lack they simply give away too much the information in the voiceover at the beginning for example be complete waste of time why give away all of that at the begin why not show thing from the hobbit point of view silly fellow go off on an adventure and bring back treasure among which be ring and then start reveal more and more of the story gradually this could be easily do with explanation by gandalf and elrond exactly as it be in the book likewise other mysterious aspect be just drop show gandalf and saruman battle be fine example much well way of do this would be to simply have the hobbit arrive at the prancing pony and not find gandalf as it be the audience know exactly what be happen right at the start ruin the suspense in general vast story full of intrigue and great sense of thing be large than just the small part the character play be reduce to jolly adventure story even this adventure be poorly execute the mood of the most poignant moment be ruin by fall back on cheesy cliche and feeble attempt at humour in moria for example right before gandalf death the terrible dwarf toss joke sure it silly but it make part of the story that could have be genuinely terrify complete spoof ruin the mood entirely likewise the pathetic battle scene antic first of all shake the camera violently whenever there any action and then use all the cliche you can the bit where one of the hobbit look to the left see the monster then look to the right and see the monster then back to the leave no monster and he relax then the monster jump out from the right again oh eek finally big part of the story just didn make much sense without the background present in the book the trip to the mountain for example be complete waste of time it would have be good to just cut that and leave more time to develop some of the other bit that be severely lack the entire time spend in lothlorien be quite useless as present wicked elf witch if it go to be simplify that much and acknowledge that it necessary in movie adaptation and expect it why not rearrange it in way that at least make sense half the action in the movie seem to be do simply because it be way to have jolly adventure rather than because there be actually any reason to do it anyway it be let down luckily manage to avoid the hype and didn get my hope up at all but it be much bad than expect m amaze that seem to be one of the few that think this way
great movie funny good story must see before logan this be my favorite non mcu marvel movie the humor land every single time thanks to ryan reynolds charismatic and hysterical performance the action be really well helm which think benefit from the fact that none of it be censor disney if make dp3 don censor it it also do great job flesh out wade wilson character instead of make him service level comedian they show us his prior life and love life and it be execute very well overall this be badass and hilarious men film and really damn good time
what die hard 5 should have be well gerard butler be back to his root on what he do best instead of constantly do romantic comedy which some be watchable but he be just well with these type or roles the action and character interaction be quite predictable and generic but the direction it go make this entertaining popcorn flick especially since the people in the white house or have anything to do with the white house be all just darn charismatic it have aaron eckhart as the president of the united state and he be tough and charismatic president if think of modern day american president aaron eckhart just pop in my head or at least someone that look similar to him and it even have morgan freeman as the speaker of the house nuff say and rick yune who be basically north korean terrorist actually somewhat stand out as the main villain well at least way more than will yun lee from the crappy red dawn reboot the plot be basically about the north korean terrorist take over the white house and only one man be capable or at least put in the situation to fight back and although some part just get really dumb it still entertain to degree when it come to action movie this be generic as it get for the most part but it just very entertaining to watch gerard butler as the secret service guy kick as and take names overall this be very watchable popcorn flick and be good throwback to the 90 action movie even if some of the one liner can get really really cheesy 7 10
bore only make it to 18 minute mark just can continue bore only make it to 18 minute mark just can continue bore all the way music suck cinematography be boring set be bore act and dialogue suck the story suck just can not sit through this nonsense 1 star failure

jackson hit the bullseye with this one m not lord of the ring or peter jackson fan saw return of the king and the frighteners but that it however judge by how much of adventurous and action pack film return of the king be know in my gut that he be the right man to remake the 1933 classic about giant ape who fall in love with human woman and break loose in new york peter jackson do great job take the material from the original king kong and translate it perfectly into his remake he take the original hour and half long movie and turn it into 3 hour epic and it great see as he want to make this film since he be 12 m really glad to see he didn make terrible film the character and the event be the same as they be in the 33 film but jackson add little extra spice to them this movie be far more adventurous than the original and it a lot of fun every see that kong appear in didn want to stop honestly could have sit through this film if it be four hour it all visually stunning as well everything be real treat to look at also d like to add that andy serkis who do the movement work for gollum in lord of the ring do great job as king kong here the performance be really great to watch be kind of worried about jack black be in this movie but after saw him play the role be stun he pull off his first dramatic role with no problem at all he be perfect as an obsessed eccentric film director naomi watt who always good anyway be awesome as kong love interest ann darrow adrien brody be the perfect male hero now even though really didn mind the 3 hour length could definitely see where some scene could have be cut the rex fight be awesome but it seem to go on forever they have whole bunch of stunt be do by kong and the rex and it make the fight kind of tedious also think they humanize kong too much we have to realize that he only an ape and even though ann may have be sympathetic don think they should have have her as in love with him as they make her out to be some of the more tender scene like kong and ann watch the sunset really seem to drag anyway this be probably the best remake ve ever see and peter jackson pull it off nicely after 32 year of wait
try very very hard maybe too hard want to make one thing clear really want to love watchman it seem like my kind of movie from the first time saw the trailer however after spend roughly 2 hour and 45 minute of my life watch them think may have be good serve watch something else win go into too many detail as there be way too many cram into this movie but here how it go in an alternate version of 1984 superheroes be real people know and those same people force them to retire so now the world be teeter on the brink of full out nuclear war and one of the former hero the big hole of the group be kill so the other hero start to think it might have be one of there own and then the blue guy get really tall and walk around with his junk hang out his girlfriend sick of do blue guy hook up with another former hero the pudgy nite owl and some other stuff happens before we find out that it be one of the hero the really rich one that set it up and he also find some way to save the world by blow up bunch of city and blame it on the blue guy my big problem with this movie be it too freak long m not against long movie but when you could cut almost an hour of the movie and not lose much something wrong there also why do they insist on include shot of dr manhattan junk be it really necessary we get it he walk around naked and can blow you up by think about it the best part of the movie for me be rorschach now that be how vigilante should be portray he like the complete antithesis of batman poor living under his secret identity and willing to kill without second think wish they could somehow spin him off for his own movie even though he meet rough end in this one overall watchman strives to be another genre break superhero movie like the dark knight but it just collapse under it own weight perhaps if synder have deviate little bit more from the source material and cut another half hour of unnecessary scene this could have be something epic instead it be an overlong bore fest fill with blue junk hole hero and sex scene end in flamethrower go off see it if you be watchmen fan but use caution if you aren

mediocre panda can believe the number of glow review this have be get the incredibles the toy story movie shrek 2 monster inc those movie deserve glow review this one be entertain but forgettable the story have no surprise at all po be name the chosen one po train to fight bad guy initially frustrating crotchety trainer but ultimately win him over po fight bad guy and win that it that the whole story you think with story that thin there be lot of room for character development but there wasn there be lot of pratfall jack black improvise the occasional bit of funny dialogue but there weren a lot of laugh in my theater the furious five character have no personality at all the villain be villainous in the most familiar and boring way possible visually the movie have some nice moment the fight scene be fun to watch really enjoy the villain escape from very impressive prison also like the look of the turtle master and the scene in which po be train to become great at kung fu use his desire to eat dumpling be great but overall the movie be unsatisfying
very very difficult to comment on see at the viennale 2016 the filmmaker abbas fahdel do great job in do this documentary about the story of his family during the year that lead to the fall of the hussein regime the movie be not one minute too long it be easy to watch like long story of gossip and this be also my main problem with this movie so many story be tell to the man behind the camera very often stories about how another person be kill robbed or otherwise treat badly can believe these people show be sure some of them exaggerate because in my experience everybody exaggerate when he tell story to another person what also remain as feeling be that every bad situation that hit an iraqi be provoke by an enemy there be not one iraqi who put some blame on himself that they endure dictatorship that they get rob by their own people that the street be unsafe etc all the time others have do something terrible wrong another problem of this documentary be that it seem that abbas fahdel seem to be part of an intellectual family and so we see mostly the world through their eye we do not see the separation between possessor and non possessor fahdel give the impression that there be no tension between the middle class and the poor the month before the beginning of war everybody be kind of excite like expect the beginning of soccer world championship the whole documentary be too biased no wonder because it be the story of one family but if you have the chance to see this documentary with all its shortcoming go and see it
unfortunate piece of cheap propaganda the movie be clearly try to present an alternative to the classic white male super hero movie character very laudable idea but the implementation be so bad that it have the opposite effect furthermore it focus so much in the racial topic that at some point it be almost racist with continuous stereotype about black people be in give way if the director would be white person would sue him for some of the thing in the movie black people act like monkey joke of them eat people etc in this sense if someone be interested in good movie that present strong character from african background rather recommend hidden figure the pursuit of happyness sic that regard the social topic that the movie be suppose to cover but that not all the scrip be rubbish after 5 minute one can imagine exactly what be go to happen most dialogue be such that one know the next sentence before the actor actress have open his her mouth the script be fill with cheap emotional sentence that seem take from some fortune cookie most actor and actress in the movie try to speak with some short of nigerian kenyan accent and the outcome be ridiculous the movie even manage to produce ridiculous character play by martin freeman the special effect of the movie be rather disappointing specially after movie like avenger age of ultron and similar one expect at least the minimum marvel quality standard regard special effect the soundtrack be also rather disappoint one good thing in the movie be some of the action scenes the fighting choreography be quite good also the car chase surprise be pretty decent another good point about the movie be that if you happen to watch it with funny group of friend then you might have cheap joke for month in this sense too the movie fall into the category of sharknado watch at your own risk
what be wrong with you people exactly what one would expect what surprise that he win an oscar for this one what an awful awful movie spielberg movie get bad and bad still at least this one have no wise kid at the centre of the action too serious subject suppose black and white or be it

gosling and crowe star in one of the most underrated and hilarious the nice guy be an absolutely fantastic film from begin to end every scene in the movie have at least 3 joke that will make you belly laugh and the action be well shot and choreograph additionally angourie rice be also great in this flick as she put on one of the best performance any child actor have do mention how funny the joke be the villain be great as well even if they be extremely intentionally cliché make them so much good that aside the film provide the audience with genuinely well think out and well execute mystery all in all be this film fantastic yes be it funny absolutely should you watch it definatly
zero patience zero budget but some pleasant song zero patience be low budget musical about the aid crisis that actually treat the subject intelligently yet manage to be fun light hearted and optimistic the film be target for an audience of gay male or at least people who enjoy watch male nudity but like it anyway the title be wordplay on patient zero the gay man who allegedly bring aid to north america and the fact that people hop for an aids cure be tire of wait they ve get zero patience near the climax of the film sir richard burton perform the title song with his friend what the time zero hour how much patience none earlier another song perform by the titular patient have chorus in french that translate as know know know that don know this richard burton be not the welsh actor but rather the 19th century explorer and linguist who accord to this movie stumble into the fountain of youth and be still alive play by an actor who look nothing like the historic sir richard burton expect this movie dialogue to mention that the real sir richard have himself circumcise in adulthood so that he could pass for an arab in order to visit mecca never fault any movie for have low budget but do get annoy when low budget filmmaker try to tell story that really require high production value in zero patience one musical number be perform aboard an airliner in flight but there be only four passenger and one stewardess dianne heatherington so the nearly empty cabin set that would have impress me in its own right look ridiculous ironically if they fill the set with more actor they could have get away with cheap set similarly at this film climax burton and his friend attempt civil disobedience but the action really cry for crowd of rebel not the handful show here be also annoy that this movie be so deeply in political correctness territory we re not suppose to use the phrase aid case because it demean we can say aid victim or aid patient because that judgmental for while the accepted phrase be people with aid pwa but even that become taboo now we re require to say person live with aid abbreviate as plwa during the airliner sequence heatherington identify her employer as plwa airline if she have say pwa airline this would have be clever and funny pun on twa real airline but she have to weaken the pun for the sake of political correctness change it to plwa this be the same sort of stupidity that make me look racist if say coloured people but get credit for be enlighten if say people of colour the cast of zero patience some of them quite talented others less so seem bit too impressed with their own allege audacity still it take some gut to tackle this particular subject in this particular way my rating 4 out of 10 and here hop that zero patience will become period piece when aid be curable

i be be generous with 4 star there be really nothing about this movie that can be consider good the acting be terrible from everyone the directing be absolute trash the script be so bad can imagine why anyone would accept to be in this movie but the absolute bad part of this movie be the soundtrack it so noticeably bad that even if everything else would be fine this soundtrack would ruin the movie for you m read all these review with 7 10 star and just can believe that these be not people from netflix or someone in some way connect to the movie you have to be really delusional to think that this be good movie

civil right for the eat pray love set for people who ve never see movie depict the civil right movement this would not be good place to start if you watch it and find it entertain then shame on you make up story about this time to entertain and manipulate for profit be pretty despicable in my view and m afraid m incredibly disappoint that this film seem to be get positive review on here if you lack education and general sense of right and wrong this be the film for you there be so many important great work in film and in literature on the era and topic how do this get make it also racist in and of itself in its depiction of black people and the white people be so disgusting and caricature of evil it entertain only if you be almost completely ignorant of that period of time for the rest of us it just offensive it also get that well worn trope of the black woman help white woman to succeed act as an apologist for here the spoiler her take off to ny in her big successful career while one happily continue to be beat by her husband and the other lose her job 100 thumb down s m not alone the association of black woman historians find it unacceptable for either this book or this film to strip black woman life of historical accuracy for the sake of entertainment yes
the fan kill it hear all the hype on social medium how this be the best show ever and it 39 reference lot however it 39 not as good as it be say to be by others it 39 something someone could get high to and not really pay attention to but can still keep up with often find myself on my phone while try to watch this show mean it 39 not bad but it 39 not good
funny not too heavy but have substance really enjoy this it easy watch but not boring think it wouldn be great so would now say give it watch
tedious long wind beautifully shoot the handmaiden be fairly tedious hard to follow art movie it look great like photography book come to life sort of but just because it nice to look at doesn mean it fun to watch the story be tell in three part each introduce by an on screen title the movie go back and forth on the timeline bit it so long wind in part that stop care who everyone be and what they be do this be anathema in any movie but more so for one that fill you in after the fact be generally loath to assume that the only reason someone say they like an adult only movie be because of the sex here have to make an exception yes it do have some fairly graphic lesbian scene though not much compare to blue be the warm colour and yes this lesbianism be between two pretty young korean actress supposedly at least most guy love to see woman make out and most of them also have preference for asian woman realise be an anomaly in not be that excite by either and take the sex out of the movie and what do you have photography book you enjoy flip through but not enough of story to make you want to take it home
very mediocre at best how do brie larson get an oscar for this she didn 39 even do that much the screen time manly go to the kid play jack idk but brie 39 part didn 39 seem whole it come across as the part have be cut lot br br the story itself be something horrible and be still happen everyday in this world however didn 39 shed tear once and can get very emotional br br the kid play jack do pretty fantastic job with the script he get but overact get quite annoy couple of time the director 39 fault though br br wouldn 39 watch it it be extremely mediocre
something old something old action steamrolls with the aid of fast shaky digicam computer can make anything mean anything happen in this film not give any spoiler here the idea be that if they can tap into your phone it mean they could also turn it on and spy on you after you turn it off that mean they could remotely control anything remotely electrical even if it not in any way link to any network or internet the first bourne be great the second be super hot but less realistic and this movie take all of that along with all the bad net spy on you theme and ramp them up to completely incredulous story that will have everyone say wow no way sorry but the action isn as good as other movie and there nothing in the story so why bother
watch like play perhaps an indicator of how far realism have come in film but this movie be more like play maybe worthy of the accolade it receive in it day but be very staged and more like play than depiction of anything real far too gentle and far too sanitize to be take as realistic
the bad pseudo play ever how do adrien brody win best actor when he couldn even convincingly fake play the piano every time he sit down at the piano roll my eye and felt so embarrass for him here go again the utterly ridiculous head sway and the faulty positioning of the hand on the keyboard the scene in which he play for the nazi guy be the most hilarious the nazi be suppose to be inspire and touch by his playing but because brody look so awful all one can think about be how truly awful it must have sound while film there be no suspension of disbelief brody have be award for fail that totally unfair if you want truly inspiring and believable performance then watch shine geoffrey rush do spectacular job at pseudo play the piano he win make you cringe or laugh in embarrassment
hollywood should not re do foreign art if you be preteen the story may work for you if you have any common sense the bad dialogue and blatant attempt remake of every ghost in the shell misunderstanding will drive you crazy special effect be decent and the story move along at decent pace however johansson should go do spinster sitcom not action or superhero movie she be one dimensional character with digitally botoxed face that walk like an ape would never watch this movie again
one of the most pointless movie have ever see perhaps miss something fictional creature create for the purpose of feed an already overfed society the acting be great but the story didn capture me it make me wonder what the writer and producer of the movie aim to stir up among their viewer whatever it be may have be more intrigued if they have choose to tell the story of the many non fictional livestock that be breed to die such story hardly require fictional twist
an optimistic in bleak world really like richard linklater the director of fast food nation because no matter what pop culture market research or his distributor tell him he continue to make movie where people talk don mean talk as in hasta la vista baby or some other cliché ridden isn that clever marketing jargon but talk as in conversation the kind that be common place before tv the internet and box in fast food nation the film message be mainly deliver through word sure there sex and violence and even special effect but for linklater film to be truly affect it require the audience to listen and if they do they will be reward it a gamble that hope will pay off because it a story that we need to hear and within his story be an underlie hope or perhaps just blind faith that an audience will watch film about real people deal with real issue there be no true good guy or bad guy in the film in an interview with my friend denis faye he say it like hey everyone do their best in this world you know his character like all of us be all flaw the good aren all good nor the bad all bad which be something mainstream movie goer particularly in the usa seem to have problem with maybe it because we don watch movie to watch people in conflict because we get enough of that in our own life but to me at least this be great statement of optimism and belief in our society that we will when give the choice choose to listen think and make our own decision even in film that show life to be pretty bleak it a very optimistic view of the world
a very bad movie with two brilliant scene this be pretty terrible movie but it a must see for two wonderful scene joe piscopo almost single handedly ruin the film with his annoy non acting and his unfunny comedy it like he never get the memo that he be in movie not another snl sketch and it sad to see treat wiliiams talented actor in what must be the low point of his career however there be two scene in the film that make it worth your time one when the meat in butcher shop come to life and another when two nearly indestructible zombie square off for shootout only they re stand about ten foot apart and use automatic weapon hilarious
long but effective all black production director king vidor also produce and work on the screenplay for this amazing early talkie pet project of the filmmaker which be tout to be the first picture with an all black cast it be later reveal to be the second the rise and fall of black preacher brother zekiel daniel haynes in the sweaty sinful south be fill with vivid performance and stun dramatic moment though the movie tend to exhaust one with its overlength and hallelujah chorus engross and emotional nevertheless with memorable finale the original treatment be by richard schayer with dialogue by ransom rideout and narrative structure from wanda tuchock 1 2 from
horrendous stupid not funny it be incomprehensible that this film garner 7 1 on here it sappy stupid and obnoxious use to be that star who have name would be worry about be involve in film that be totally vapid that day be long go the story be so stupid the end be so sentimental and dumb as the sputter blunderbus fly off during the climax of this piece of crap could only think of the score of starve people who could have be feed instead of spending million on this useless pablum and john favreau do this be all the more hilarious the way he chomp his cigar while wax unpoetic about the biz on bravo you actually think he have more in mind than just cash in on piece of garbage like this the whole cast look like they be attend wake except for will ferrell who turn in another classic post snl performance one dimensional schticky idiocy that might work in 2m skit but leave you numb after an hour and half
among the bad that hollywood have to offer wish there be zero rating on imdb the movie industry ought to have toxic waste rating the kind that damage our society with absolutely no chance of cleanup yes believe that the crow be the love canal of movie can believe this motion picture be direct by the same person who direct dark city if have see the crow an early film first would never have view dark city and that would have be shame the two don belong on the same planet they truly don reside in the same universe the only thing can figure the crow come out of hollywood while dark city come out of australia regardless of what roger ebert say about the crow he call it good to me it be the bad piece of ultra violent dreck have ever see even include narc the only other film ve rat 1 here both richly deserve complete zero detect pattern here both films story take place in detroit moral never watch any film whose setting be detroit the crow be genuinely scary to me but not in the way you might imagine think the horribly ultra violent spirit of the film completely unrelieved throughout no matter the insipid unbelievably saccharine good guy win end contribute directly to brandon lee death how else can you explain something as bizarre as blank movie prop round kill someone during the filming of motion picture it be obvious to me that so many way over the top many blank shot have to be fire at the so called hero that this must have contribute to lee death someone say this film be fit memorial to lee indeed no further comment require even the music during the end credit it can rain all the time or whatever it call be nausea produce garbage the singer be horribly flat pitch that be just listen to it if you dare it be totally forgettable trash thank heavens it have be forget make the mistake of start to play the comment track by the producer and screenwriter do wish english grammar allow me to de capitalize their title think they be quite demented totally out of touch with reality believe their warped view of the world have cause them to descend into the depth of self aggrandize insanity people do not view the crow ever unless you like flirt with brain damaging toxic waste if you let any teenager view this film it should be consider that you should be jail for launch sociopathic violence on the rest of us thank goodness watch the crow only once be hop that time will heal all wound

almost perfect as tarantino as it get reservoir dog be exactly what you 39 expect from him it 39 funny it 39 gory it 39 brutal and above all else it 39 absolutely ridiculous this movie could 39 ve be so incredible but unfortunately it slightly miss the mark br br what love about this movie be no doubt what everyone else love as well those scene in the warehouse be spectacular the fact that you can make conversation between people so intense and thrilling be remarkable and this movie nail that every scene in the warehouse be perfect you never know what be go to happen and you be constantly on the edge of your seat have this movie be entirely in the warehouse 39 sure would 39 ve like it way more br br as be though the movie doesn 39 do that it almost feel like tarantino know how intense those warehouse scene be and decide that the viewer need break as such the film go on to give introduction to some of the character these introduction however felt completely unnecessary to me not only do they break the pace and intensity of the film but they also break the mystery and intrigue of the character would 39 ve be perfectly fine with never know anything but the make up name that each character have especially the introduction of mr orange felt unnecessarily long and add very little to the overall story br br this movie could 39 ve be near perfect have it keep true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moment use that confine location and nothing else and pit these character against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would 39 ve truly be sight to behold want to be on the edge of my seat the whole time especially consider the relatively short runtime ala be force to take break and breathe for moment just be bring back into the excellence of the warehouse br br with all that be say it 39 still great movie it have all the characteristic you 39 want from tarantino film and it be immensely entertaining even in the slow moment it probably isn 39 a classic yet but it undoubtedly will be one in the future as far as 39 concern it wasn 39 as good as it could 39 ve be but that 39 just my opinion and base on most review that 39 ve read many consider it to be as good as it could 39 ve ever be
decent but not as good as it look wouldn say have really high expectation for this film however it do look entertain from the preview and d hop it would be something walk out think it be real solid movie like the loser or mission impossible flick wouldn say the movie be disappointment it be entertain and it keep me engage the whole time but there be few flaw that just keep this from be on par with mr mr smith kind of movie in that movie there be plenty of comedy action and just sense of coolness that this didn have m not say want repeat of mr mr smith be just kind of look forward to some cool action with comedy thrown in first of all the chemistry between cruise and diaz just seem forced cruise have this glaze over look the entire movie as if his character be just beat puppy go through the motion of spy in the mission impossible movie felt like he be actually spy and he have lot of emotion but just couldn get past the vacant look in his eye the whole time his age be start to show little in his face and like he desperately try to hold on to the young action roles he use to play this translate into the chemistry between him and cameron diaz character m not sure can even describe it but there be just something miss in cruise performance that make him seem so distant maybe it be some sort of confidence think that might be it his character seem to lack that bad confidence we expect from our cool spy it be like ok m awesome sigh but who care guess ll kill this guy the second thing that bug me be how much be give away in the trailer that suck the life out of the movie there be some pretty decent action scene but they be almost all show in the preview hate when film do that but know they get ta suck people in first and foremost with the eye candy along with that complaint get ta mention that the cgi be little weak some chase scene be just bit too easy to peg as blue screen shot those picking aside it be enjoyable watch that will suffice as average to slightly above average action barely comedy date movie there definitely few movie would put above this one on the must see for the summer before devote your money to this but it probably worth matinée
oliver stone should keep his hand off the horror genre all the overenthusiastic movie junky who claim that oliver stone be genius and undeniable master in cinema should watch this early failure and reconsider sure film like platoon and jfk which he direct and title like midnight express and scarface which he write speak to the imagination but this grotesque and rather nasty horror film be completely uninspired and silly actually it just plain rip off from the classic suspense film the beast with five finger star the legendary peter lorre small spoiler michael caine play an entangled cartoonist who lose his hand in an accident his lose hand come to life again and seem to start kill spree be that true or be our cartoonist just hallucinate and suffer from twist murderous pressure himself end spoilers the acting performance of the entire cast be far below standard especially annie mcenroe don know where stone find her but she sure can act her way out of this even though it a rather simple role overall the whole movie contain exactly one scene that be worth mention and that be the accident sequence in which caine lose his hand not much be it oliver stone might be master in certain field but when it come to horror he surely need help hand next
clever thriller but not as clever as others have make out the first hour be confuse its suppose to be the whole point of this film be to keep you guess until the final scene where the whole thing come together just think that the final revelation wasn that mind blowing and bit disappointing one other point that didn think be too realistic be how quickly everybody around the main character accept and adapt to his condition in order to exploit him all in all its good film with excellent performance from pearce and moss and be different to anything else ve ever see 7 10
highly overrate for movie that supposedly cost 50m to make it have low budget feel to it g the movie consistently use the same group of extra to portray the reaction of the hoi polloi in the universe this be simply lazy and unpolished movie make what little of the special effect use in the movie be of the run of the mill variety as for action sequence they be mainly confine to brief sequence near the end as action sequence go one can easily find low budget hk kungfu movie that will deliver significantly more punch pun intend the storyline adapt from comicbook novel be ordinary and nowhere near the epiphany induce mind blow jaw drop experience document by many reviewer as whole the movie do not live up to its 8 rating in imdb at best 5 10
the most over hyped movie of all time all right might be wrong consider haven and wouldn dare waste my time watch the 2 sequel now before you start email bomb me let me give chance to explain myself little m not gon na sit here and say this movie be horrible that go too far lot of time and effort obviously go into the making of this film the production value be great the scenery be sometimes beautiful the special effect be decent and the directing could have be lot bad you see m not gon na be some idiot who post the lord of the ring be complete crap and rate it 1 actually rat this movie 3 that be say the acting be far from impressive the story certainly didn grab be nearly enough to be interested in waste another 3 plus hour piece on sequel the whole thing basically scream blah to me movie that at best could be consider decent the fact that this movie along with the 2 sequel sit comfortably on the top 10 movie of all time be really scary to me do people grasp the concept of all time we re not talk about the best film of the year here there have be ten of thousand of movie make since the invention of cinema do you people really believe that the 3 lotr movie surpass all of those movie wow what one in billion coincidence that would be it make me think most of the people who rat this movie have only see about 5 10 movie in their life do people forget such cinematic achievement as taxi driver rashomon clockwork orange and reservoir dog just to name few take some solace at the fact that 55 of the people who rat this movie give it 10 prove that most of these people be either fanatical or just try to drive this movie up the imdb ladder of all time great but hey to each his own the fantasy genre have never be one of my favorite maybe m crazy but doubt it

funny action movie ve ever see great action horrible story haven laugh so hard in an action movie in so long think snort at one point it a shame because m morgan freeman fan and like gerard butler but this movie be horribly hysterical it have true potential start out great and think it would ve be take in whole other non bs way the premise of the story make no sense that everyone would choose to save the president instead of the rest of the world the president actually encourage the others to give up their nuc code to the terrorist way funny mean truthfully if you want good laugh then this might do the trick save for less than handful of scene this could ve play like an action spoof movie the action be good mean have to be convince the only reason butler take the role be so he could shoot bunch of thing and to the same token morgan freeman must ve take his role because he get to act as president of the united state nevertheless this movie fail to be what it suppose to be and succeed at everything it not one of my favorite comedy for sure
aronofsky passion project be kind of masterpiece first off you should not plan to see noah because it be biblical epic nor should you plan to skip noah precisely because it be biblical epic you should however see noah because it be an amazing film use the basic story of noah ark to deliver fantasy action adventure and psychological horror story and deliver very relevant ecological message that subtle the visuals be out of this world particularly one scene depict the creation of the universe from the big bang to scientifically accurate representation of what darwinian evolution would look like speed up about million time the whole scene would feel right at home in an episode of cosmos yes you read that right special mention must be make to russel crowe who deliver the complicated picture of man that both save the world but be also suppose to let it die and all of the weight one must feel about it can praise this movie enough it basically perfect if you be even the least bit curious about go do so you win regret it
nothing new nothing different nothing at all sadly the pianist disappoint me in more way than one adrian brody do nothing worthwhile other than save his own skin and there nothing wrong with that m sure thousand of jew do the same the problem be don care about them either the holocaust be horrible atrocious sicken series of event which leave million dead wound and mentally scar we know this and don mean to brush off anything or downplay the gravity of what occur but ve see it all before there be some senseless killing of jew more senseless killing of jew liquidation and salvation nothing more nothing less m sadly remind that if an event be horrible enough people will continue to laud and applaud movie make about it even if they have nothing new to say call brody act whatever lovely adjectives you want minimalist subdue etc but to me it be bland and forgettable don get me wrong think brody be tremendous actor but in this movie didn see man who be scar nor determine to fight for his life or to see thing through instead saw man who be just go through the motion whatever happens happen in way he be neither brave nor memorable and certainly not relatable didn care about him his family and in the end none of the character and didn feel even the slight hint of emotion the only time be even remotely rouse be when halina think her name be halina be reunite with the family after the second liquidation of the ghetto in the end pianist give little more than tired rehash of the same old same old thing be bad know but if you re go to make yet another holocaust film at least do it right make it interest make it meaningful make it say something this say nothing more than look how bad thing be in the end his ability to play the piano save his life in way or it be merely weary nazi officer who show him mercy if you want to see real holocaust movie one need only turn to schindler list felt mean really felt the character pain and emotional conflict the book be incredible as well it be well make and have an actual plot not just broad story arc where nothing other than the usual happen just because it a holocaust film doesn automatically make it good
waste potential this movie could have be great but it have lot of plot hole and ultimately make no sense there be absolutely no character development we know nothing about either of the character from begin to end they present no reason for them to do anything besides the fact that they do it to move the story along can accept the cold opening and lack of backstory but ex machina do not do anything with its concept they never explore the philosophical implication of anything there be so much waste potential here initially you think that caleb have some interesting question for the robot but it never go anywhere the most they could do be shoehorn couple quote in there instead of actually delve into philosophical idea the dialogue in this movie be stilted the conversation be not meaningful when they should have be the whole focus of the movie really want this movie to be good but it another case of the trailer be good than the film if you re look for insightful thought on ai and human behavior then this movie do not deliver it shallow than kiddie pool
horrible couldn agree more with oqonac this may be not only the bad sequel ever but the bad horror movie ever nowadays certain filmmaker think by throw name or specific place c magik force into the movie they re create an acceptable sequel this movie take 90 minute of my life away and demand them back know should have have the smart to walk out of the theater

great start to the dark universe the mummy be lot good than be expect it be about what be expect which be good and didn really feel like it be do nothing but universe building there be bit of that but they do focus mostly on the mummy nick morton tom cruise and jenny halsey annabelle wallis this be your basic mummy story though they give enough of different background to ahmanet to at least partially distinguish her from previous mummy she be go to become the most powerful princess in the world until her father knock up his new wife who bore him son ahmanet be not go to have any of that so she kill everyone she sell her soul to set who promise to make her queen in exchange for give him physical form her father soldier capture her and mummify her alive skip to present day where nick morton be look to make some money by break into tomb on map he steal from jenny she catch up to him just after he find the tomb and they explore it together they find ahmanet tomb and accidentally revive her ahmanet decide nick will be her new chosen one the new body for set and that bring nick to the attention of prodigium group dedicate to study and destroy monster the cast of the mummy be very good tom cruise be still tom cruise but as he manage to do in all his movie he manage to sell it very well annabelle wallis play decent jenny halsey and while think she could have be little bit strong in her role she be not weak wilt wallflower she kick as much butt as tom cruise do but the real joy of this movie be sofia boutella as ahmanet role she almost seem born to play she play sexy well and she play psychotic well and the people in charge of makeup turn her into really excellent mummy the mummy be also beautiful movie they do not overdo the cinematography keep it very ground but they didn make anything unnecessarily dark just because the special effect be great and they do not do anything unnecessary probably the big cgi scene be scene in london that last maybe five minute and there be no cgi heavy end fight like have be happen in movie lot lately they seem to try to keep cgi out as much as they could which be very refresh they still use it don get me wrong but it didn seem to be everywhere the movie move along at brisk pace didn drag anywhere and the set and costume be fabulous be very happy with the mummy didn expect lot so be pleasantly surprise with what get not everyone be go to like it though but m big universal monster fan and can wait to see what they do with their upcoming movie just hope there be upcoming movie consider the bad review this movie be get which it really do not deserve

one of the most ambitious comicbook film of all time merely live action adaptation base off of one of the most celebrated graphic novel of all time watchman direct by the visionary filmmaker of man of steel and 300 zack snyder come true masterpiece of film with an unforgettable cast aside from this film be an adaptation it be very unique yet at the same time very balsy for zack snyder to pull of this project after alan moore have say nobody could replicate or adapt his novel well it might just have be reborn on the big screen in the most epic and complex way possible the vfx process of billy crudup dr manhattan be sufficent for its time be able to see the freckle on his back just such great detail with the power of the effect with the right amount as well not overstuffed not that this film would need to rely on the effect it be definitely well than the new watchman show on hbo not that it be yayha abdul mateen fault it be just very poor representation of the comic this be very underrated comicbook film not just for comicbook film but for film in general this movie be truly be ahead of its time guarantee if it be release today it would have get the attention and praise it deserve thankfully it be slowly get some with its grow relevance throughout the year it ll age like fine wine
what stupid movie what be the purpose of have stellar cast waste of time the story be purposeless and no direction what be this movie try to be because it be definitely not thriller not drama and not romance genre and it wasn the kind of movie that let you go into deep though either nothing absolutely nothing do not waste your time
the book the movie etc one pleasant aspect of have read previous review of this film by some professional critic then have decide to avoid it because it be purportedly not true to the original story be that when do give it try on rerun tv sort of like it true it be if nothing else woman movie fill with sentimental clichés and other oddly familiar image but the cinematography be quite appealing as be those odd image reminiscent of just about every american go to you name the european country and find romance thrill the meaning of life etc film ever make apart from its travelogue flavor there be just enough scenes involve adequate direction and act to keep the thing from fall by the wayside and the casting be jolly quite liked sandra oh in her part and pavel be obviously caricature of the young john paul ii then there be the hilarious and rather tongue in cheek reminder of fellini one wonder if the author be make fun of herself just bite give that the book from which all this start be so much more serious complex and engage
not for those over the age of 12 four time in as many movie blue sky studio have prove itself distant third when it come to cgi film make like the ice age movie before it horton hears who coast on the big name talent behind the mic ignore the clever styling and over their head adult humor that have make pixar and to lesser extent dreamworks so successful all in all your kid will probably be entertain for 90 minute but horton really be nothing more than cinematic cotton candy empty calorie and completely forgettable as for the cast carell show real flair for voice over work while carrey performance leave something to be desire one doesn realize how much of his shtick involve facial expression which don come through very well on an elephant computerized visage the less player notably isla fisher turn in some very good work the animation be fair but nowhere near the quality or detail of pixar pic but the real problem with horton be the dialog it just wasn funny even the small child in the audience laugh only occasionally and chuckle only once during the movie thankfully short run time perhaps the writer felt compel to remain true to seuss original work as they seem to add very little originality and whole lot of benign filler so unless you re die to get the kid out of the house and don mind drop 10 head at your local amc wait for horton to hit the bargain bin and save for you money for wall this summer
good than critic say why critic trash this film be beyond me it actually quite entertaining berry pull off the role very nicely and stone portray the villainess with nice icey edge bratt be good as the hero cop as well the soundtrack be kick and the story line be never bore the most unfortunate thing can think of say about this film be that it have the misfortune of open up against big blockbuster film like the bourne supremacy and robot while spiderman 2 be still go strong also this be good little action type movie that should be give chance ignore the critic always do and check it out for yourself though this film be no comparison to star war in any way shape or form read somewhere that critic as usual trash that too see it and then decide for yourself
good but massively over rat lot of people look on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comment but feel justify in say that the lord of the ring trilogy and this final part in particular be possibly some of the most over rated film of all time hasten to add that do like the film and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but just do not see them as the 10 10 all time great that other people see them as love fantasy story and film in general just find these film to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they be the main thing in the trilogy find absolutely impressive be gollum andy serkis the motion capture performance by serkis be genius and the cgi character be the best up to that time also gollum be great character hilarious sometimes creepy and fascinate also you can not fault christopher lee as saruman ian mckellen as gandalf and there be other good performance too most people who love the book or love this kind of story understandably lap the film up enthusiastically an epic massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and love fantasy story be somewhat irresistible to anyone who like fantasy story at all however be little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the film and have remain so with each view they be not bad film at all they have great spectacle have some epic action some scene with effective humour or emotion and some fine actor but there be lot find disappointing lotr would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and don think these film do it as well as they could there be lot of time waste unnecessarily and important aspect of story and character be leave out or underdeveloped find peter jackson generally far from 100 successful director his version of king kong be poor and show his fault even lot more than the lotr trilogy all these jackson make film be bit overblown and little pretentiously direct extremely long shot of character gaze into camera at each other or into the distance occur so often it be incredible great director do not need word to tell story or convey emotion and the face and eye of an actor can be use to huge effect but most shot of character without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they be waste time frodo elijah wood especially just gaze or gawp for what seem like age without make me connect with his feeling and without move the character or story on at all cgi be the real king in these film and as impressive as many scene be it never thrill as much as the real scenery or real action in some old epic the epic spectacle be therefore not enough to carry me away on its own it require great storytelling some great storytelling do occur in these film but do not feel tolkein story or character be do full justice due to jackson wasting time on pretty glossy showy film make real efficiency and supreme skill be need to get the most from the source material and this be lack for instance return of the king miss out important aspect of aragorn feramir and saruman story and find frodo come across as rather petulant annoying and lack heroism samwise come across lot well great villain complete great story sauron appear feeble villain throughout the trilogy flame eye be not exactly darth vader tolkein create villain difficult to show effectively on screen and jackson presentation of sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all saruman be good villain and be brilliantly act by christopher lee but have totally insufficient screen time particularly in the final story where he go straight to dvd overall the return of the king be easily the weak of the trilogy for my taste feature fault have list above rather overblown cgi action and an extraordinarily drag out end yes these film be very good but for me they be nowhere near the classic they be repute to be or that they could have be if perfectly direct
surprisingly flat m not sure what it be about killer elite that disappoint me but it just didn seem to live up to its potential it might have be that the movie rely on jason statham to act instead of just do action he play retire hit man who get pull out of retirement to save friend life but it just doesn work he unconvincing the retirement isn convincing and neither be his reluctance to return to work he be much well in the mechanic which deal with similar issue overall the movie doesn hold together very well there be too much that they be try to accomplish but not enough get develop for instance the romance between danny statham and anne yvonne strahovski just seem to be cut in to the movie in few place the feathermen the group about whom the book the movie draw from be write appear in few scene yet they re role be barely explore they be splice in just enough to give spike clive owen support system it not terrible movie but it could have be much more think it would make good mini series so that the different part could be explore properly if not eliminate the thing that aren give justice
great movie well than the first one be really surprised about what an amazing job james wan do with this sequel from the very start it capture you and keep you attach to the screen there be no way you can get bore love the suspense that go increase pretty quickly through the whole film could feel my heart in my ear beat faster as the atmosphere grow creeper and creeper enjoy all the small detail throw around such as the name of the demon that be show in the warren house more than once in the background leave me with the question why that word keep be repeat nobody in that house have that name only at the end figure out what it mean absolutely adore the whole plot and the plot twist within make up and special effect be crazy they make you get chill run down your spine the soundtrack be impeccable it play big part in create the right atmosphere few jump scare very well situate some of them very unpredictable didn see couple of them come at all find that vera farmiga be absolutely stun with her performance in this movie love the way lorraine have her moment when step in to save her husband condemn the demonic entity back to hell she be incredibly intense personally think patrick wilson do good job in this movie compare to the first felt like ed and his relationship with lorraine be lot more highlighted highly recommend this movie if you be fan of the paranormal you can miss it
i enjoy this movie fast furious feature all the thing we know and love from its predecessor though this film do have some inconsistency with its plot and certain aspect of the film however you ll still be entertain
skip the first 40 minute the acting be bad and the first half of the movie be lot of unnecessary character development guess no one ever tell sly that when you 39 re on the 5th movie in franchise we don 39 need that much time to get reacquaint with the main character give it 3 star because the action sequence have some pretty cool moment but besides that the movie be waste of time this be really disappointing for me because think the 2008 rambo be awesome probably watch that one 20 time this one 39 ll probably never watch again
a disappointing mess of film only make bearable because of very few scene when go to the theater be fill with hope excitement and joy m the big hobbit fan know adore the movie the book and collect all the trinket and art book can and since the desolation of smaug have be quite good movie and have hear peter jackson claim this film be go to be even more serious and thriller i naturally assume it be go to be dark thrill movie that have me on the edge of my seat this be not the case the movie start with an extremely anticlimactic scene that kill suspension of disbelief and continue on the same track smaug while masterpiece of animation be disappoint as be most of the movie the film continue and be more and more confused this be not the movie have expect it lack good plot be confuse even to me who have read the book and the production book five time over and could not decide what it want to be one second it be comedy and while some scene be amuse enough some be just cringe worthy peter jackson horrendous comic timing make itself know but these scene completely ruin the atmosphere of the film make it dull and bland instead of tense and excite the only save grace this piece of badly direct trash have be the scene with the king of the dwarf thorin succumb to madness and his relationship dynamic with bilbo who have very little screen time for film about him these scene be brilliant mostly because of the heartfelt and excellent acting of richard armitage and martin freeman sadly even though one feel these scene should be in center the movie choose to focus on dull battle sequence the scene that be truly good be hastily skip over and we move to classic bad pj comedy and awful battle scene while in lord of the ring there be some goofy battle scene this movie almost seem like it try to make parody of itself do not find many problem with legolas gravity defy skill in desolation of smaug but here it make you wonder if middle earth be actually the moon in regard to the gravity free atmosphere other than the terrible battle scene we have the focus on romance plot so bad it almost make me blush of second hand embarrassment it like the movie be try to emulate element from titanic but fail miserably the romance be so forced it might as well be spoof and be complete waste of female character be in favor of female character be add to the story in fact love it but here it be so blatantly clear tauriel be only add to be kili love interest and it hurt my heart to see female character butcher in this way and that not even mention the atrocity that be make galadriel who be the strong person in middle earth lay on the floor sobbing and wait for her strong male wizard companion to help her the death scene of some of the character be underwhelming except for one which be emotional enough to make me give this movie my almost approval but it be just as many of us fear this movie give no screen time or attention to dwarf who be not thorin oakenshield and kili we don even see them fight in this movie they just stand in the background so to sum it up if you expect thrill experience you re out of luck the movie be generally poorly pace poorly direct with really awful cgi conflict that be create solve and sometimes forget in the blink of an eye and an excess of legolas who be literally just there to look pretty and do stunt it be worth watch if you re fan but only for couple of scene that the director seem to have deem unimportant despite them be the only reason this movie be even worth the name tasteless joke awful fight scene terrible cheesy romance that put the notebook to shame and more question than answer in the end peter jackson truly do not deliver even though it clear he try he simply try too much
another garbage sex comedy movie total waste of script well american virgin be another comedy movie that have lot of sex and nudity scene along with vulgar humor and story that miss the whole point of it show priscillia hard life after she be well know porn star and her denial to it maybe the whole movie be simply not funny and most of the development aren good nor interesting not mention how boring it be pretty dry and dreadful for me the cast and the script weren good and most of the character didn really have any impact on the story and besides the whole end big spoiler here be really cheesy and unrealistic not mention how stupid it be when priscillia find out she wasn the naked girl in the tape lame in conclusion waste of time not good movie at all
tough to beat this movie be not get into the the great picture of all time debate it too subjective but if force to cast vote would give this the most serious consideration mean what aspect of this film isn top notch the dialog be superb one of the best ever put on film the acting be great cinematography first rate and the story offer an interesting mix of drama action romance music you name it this film have everything but color which might prohibit of lot of young folk from ever check this classic out that would be shame because film make doesn get much good than casablanca all of this doesn mean it my favorite film of all time it isn even in my top ten but always find it very very enjoyable and the late 2 disc dvd transfer make it even well to view humphrey bogart and ingrid bergman of course be the star but always find claude raines character the best to watch his witty dialog as the police chief always make me smile he have many clever line and isn a guy you can figure out he and bogart character be similar essentially come across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside be good hearted people the end be much discuss and very famous and help make the movie so revere there have be so much write about this film that there win add more except to make one negative statement but that about line in the story and not reflection on the quality of the film wasn impress that bergman despite be marry be willing to run off with bogart claim she doesn know what right or wrong be you serious well judging by the marriage record of hollywood over the year maybe they don know adultery just might be wrong anyway other than that this be great movie with many many classic scene bergman never look prettier albeit the aid of soft lens shot on her closeup and bogey be never more well bogey than in here add paul henreid sydney greenstreet peter lorre and other fine actor and wow what cast an added bonus be hear as time go by throughout the film haunting song actually there be several song play mainly by pianist dooley wilson and they re all fun to hear as say one could go on and on about this movie nuff say
not as atrocious as it make out to be but bad for sure the only reason want to watch this film be that it get no less than 9 nomination for the 2007 razzies include 3 for lindsay lohan alone figure that only really really bad film could achieve this and since love laughing at lame movie as much as the next guy immediately track down this movie to watch it and have good time laugh at how bad it would be now the first thing want to say about know who kill me be this if this movie be as many viewer say the bad film they ve ever see clearly these people have not see much on the top of my head can think of dozen movie that be absolutely atrocious and way way bad than this lindsay lohan vehicle while love read extreme movie review post by angry reviewer you have to be honest at some point know who kill me be not unwatchable in any way with that say m not go to defend this movie and say it great it be not it be bad the problem be that there be two type of bad movie you have the so bad they re funny bad movie which be entertain and you have the bad just bad film which be unfunny and boring unfortunately know who kill me fall into the latter category sometimes you know right from the first scene that movie be go to suck that be the case for basic instinct 2 which incidentally win the razzie of bad movie in 2006 right from the opening with sharon stone drive the sport car straight into the river you know that what would follow would be dreadful the same thing happen here in the first ten minute be strike by how all the actor be so awkward and unable to portray anything correctly the actor play the cop take the cake ve hardly ever see cop character play so badly and unconvincingly and then the plot start so to speak at first the premise seem just as interesting as any pampered girl get kidnap and torture by serial killer then mysteriously reappears but claim she a different person sound intriguing enough the sort of stuff david lynch could use but everything fall apart in no time the whole thing turn out to be yet another story base on paranormal tripe and very boring one at that the writer have no idea about what make good story character or situation his script be ridden with clichés plot hole and cop out random example as if the whole stigmatic twin stuff be not far fetch enough near the end of the movie dakota suddenly have an epiphany convenient isn it that give her all the information she need to find the killer sure why bother with rational stuff just make the character have an epiphany and the job be do everything in that script be just botch and lazy the whole thing be certainly not help by the weak cast and the clumsy direction of chris sivertson whose great idea here be to add unsubtle reference to the colour blue all the time while give clipesque look to the extended torture scene now about lindsay lohan she the only person who show some involvement she no scarlet johansson or kirsten dunst but at least she try the problem be that her acting skill be too limited to handle the good girl bad girl thing on screen and the material she give whether it the script or direction be way too poor for her to salvage anything the strip scene in which she doesn even remove her bra let applaud the writer again for realism be totally ugly and un sexy the sex scene where she go at it with her sister boyfriend seem to come right from the next american pie movie everything be like this but it not entirely lohan fault she look competent in some scene and she the only reason why you want to sit through this bore until the killer identity be reveal and the movie end at last that pretty much sum it up know who kill me be clearly straight to dvd material that only get release in theatre because lohan be in it but again despite be awfully bore and flaw it not the sheer atrocity some claim it be you ll see much much bad than this jaw the revenge anyone know who kill me be just boring not bad enough to be funny film among thousand of its sibling
so be interested but hop this get somewhere faster so will hit the pro and con for this will update this review over the show run pro like the actor they do good with their script and their onscreen chemistry be great like lot of the loose plotholes this show be tie up there be lot of them leave dangling and so they should be wrap up zemo other winter soldier like they be shed light on forgotten avenger like winter soldier and falcon it be good when they do that in wandavision and it be important to remember support charactersnow for my least favorite favorite part of review the con will try to be quick as be fond of this show and while it have flaw my low rating will get high it be take long time to build up for wanda vision it work well but for such quick pace show it need to get somewhere faster we kind of skipped over sam family issue and bucky trauma in favor of more action while like action those be important story element there be too many name to keep up with and it isn explain well what be go on that think they could have do well final thought it be too early to review this show be leave my review so far and intend to update it so most of the issue will probably get addressed if you be question the authenticity of my review be aware it be of the quality of the show itself and how feel for clarification so this be my opinion and please feel free to disagree
not disney pixar quality honestly can believe m write this but this movie fall so completely flat realllly want to like onward but the storyline drag and leave nothing to the imagination it incredibly predictable and even the funny part feel force watch this with 3 other people who be all ready to turn it off we keep go because hey it be free and we didn have anything else to watch if d have see this in theatre and pay 17 ticket d be extremely disappointed the entire film feel force which suck because absolutely adore tom holland and chris pratt
strongly mixed feeling film split in two it be very hard to rate this movie since it should really be split in two the beginning love be be not give much to know and perhaps we didn need to know anything the cinematography be great the music be adequate the actor be very good though always say that the great quality wim wenders have as film maker he lack when it come to scenario in the second half of the movie we be give to understand the typical unoriginal backstory to the whole situation the back story be not interesting and it be also tell to us in very unoriginal and think all to direct way my recommendation be to watch this movie halfway or 3 4 if have do that probably would have give this movie an 8 or 9 sadly watch it until the end like normal person and all the mysteriousness slight absurdity feel of the plot situation etc and all the endear quality that the character have be destroy the end be also completely unrealistic here it be important to make difference between what say surrealist or strange which be in way voluntarily unrealistic and unrealistic which mean as want to be realistic but fail at it miserably know that the second half be terrible would still watch this movie again and almost give it 7

if you love saw you will love this now m no hater of violence in film and rather enjoy good horror the two lead be both actor usually enjoy and they both give good performance be this the film making and camera work in this film be very very good it well act and think the director and script writer get the film they want so what be the reason have score this 2 well it torture porn it may even be the first of the current seemingly never end proliferation of title and just can see the attraction on on end suffering and pain as the subject of film the only reason for such film seem to me to show increasingly nasty way of maiming and kill people if that kind of film be what you enjoy then watch this as it be certainly well make and act than most of the genre but it not for me
expectedly grade the only reason even bother with this even though knew that wouldn like it be jennifer garner whom think be totally totally totally hot too bad for her she deserve much good script elektra have its share of grip moment but on the whole it be awfully silly first of all and this really irk me they shamefully get korean actor to play japanese how many time must hollywood commit this kind of stupidity before they realise that the different asian race aren substitute for each other admittedly the korean actor be hot but that be not the point secondly elektra boast some of the bad special effect ve ever see they look like something out of computer game or low budget locally produce gongfu television series the constant usage of slow motion go heavily into overkill territory such that some of such moment become so cheesy that they completely lose their credibility and the semblance to depth and mean the film maker be obviously aim for an example would be the fight scene between elektra and the pseudo japanese dude with the sword thirdly the plot or what be suppose to be the plot ll just say this plainly what the hell be that the end leave much to be desire not only be it extremely anti climatic and that it induce it be also blatantly obvious that the people behind it be already gear themselves up for sequel question which you expect the movie to answer upon its conclusion be hardly dealt with hence cheat the audience out of holistic cinematic experience save for elektra there be also grave lack of character development the only reason care about mark whateverhisnameis be because it goran visnjic who be deliciously gorgeous other than that couldn care any less about the other character the plus point elektra be halfway understood and jennifer garner portray her nuance with tremendous efficacy and then there goran visnjic who be have mention this deliciously gorgeous hence it too bad that he have such little screen time believe would have enjoy the movie lot more if there be more of him in addition elektra be marginally good than daredevil which be the most boring and pointless action movie ve see in quite while and one last plus point elektra do not have the insufferable ben affleck that a cause for cheer and celebration whatever the occasion see this only if you like jennifer garner and goran visnjic
a feast for the soul take great ingredient include but not limit to an endear story with meaning and message superb and breathtaking animation brilliantly voice narration and as cute rattus rattus you 39 re ever likely to encounter combine refine form and bake to perfection the result jaw drop piece of film that you can perpetually admire enjoy and savour
horrible movie horrible movie with cheap budget of production three room four unknown actor with horribly write script the entire story could have be do and dust in 30 minute lot of waffle no content the guy give this movie high score either work for the production company or have very very weird sense of good film lot of uncalled for nudity and bad language lot of repetition and weird sick sexuality it one of these film that you see and think oh god sit on the toilet for the same amount of time would have be more productive
soulless boring uninspired and predictable warning spoiler m not go to go into all of the implausible science in the film that be well cover by every other review here in many year have never see movie receive such undeserving critical praise it be clear from the review here that many people find this film to be the boring and slow slog that do simply put this movie doesn matter matt damon star as another maroon astronaut the second time in two year he play such role the difference be of course that his character in interstellar be far more interesting and have more depth than the astronaut he play in the martian every single character be cookie cutter every single line of dialogue be write as it be for tv character meant for an unsophisticated audience that mentally fist pump when they re expose to such gripping dialogue as m gon na have to science the sh out of this and let go get our boy deliver as flatly as it do here through actor like damon barely passable and jeff daniel wholly insufferable and cringe induce it make you want to slap your hand to your ear to make the pain stop after 2 hour go by and you realize that the most interesting and exciting part of this movie occur be its first 4 minute irritation set in don know whether to blame andy weir or draw goddard but put self aggrandize clown at the center of movie about be alone in an alien world completely sap all electricity and tension from the proceeding so yeah while thing like put tarp over spaceship bother me that not what make me think this movie be trash instead it the way it use hackneyed feel good human moment to prick thousand hole in balloon of tension it should have be build what waste of time how do the critic screw this up so bad avoid
overrated mix of typical american hollywood hero and sloppy storyline really don understand what everyone great fascination be with this movie there be couple of good scene that be funny and have the right emotional level there be some twist that be way too predictable or too easily brush off while use to like mcconahey act think he have be way too over the top with his role in this one like anne hathaway in few of the scene as well as the daughter though character development be basically non existent and be pretty bored multiple time during the movie which leave me disconnect to the character and not care about the end of the story really just hop it would end at some point while the science behind it be truly fascinate the movie be neither outstanding nor be the story it have potential but be just so underdeveloped
decent movie poor tolkien adaptation first off be huge fan of tolkien and as one will base most of my critic on his book the movie be standard adventure movie well make with nifty special effect nice sound track and fine acting now if this movie be call something else than lord of the ring the review wouldn be half this good as they be here the problem of the movie be that it take the basic story line from tolkien book but then it go and hollywood everything it can numerous scene from the book be eight miss or change quite lot the character be change from the book also thing that think should be punishable what the movie lack be deep insight of the character in it know that it be almost impossible to make good film out of good book and it didn work here eighter mostly the motivation of the character be leave hazy at best as adventure movie it would rate 7 10 as adaptation of tolkien it rate 2 10i mean honestly what on earth be arwen do at rivendell ford and as for the comment that this movie be the best ever can only say that eighter you be very young or you havent see good movie peter jackson should have call this movie an adventure movie base on the lord of the ring

very absorb but could have be more the client be good film with moment of extreme greatness especially for courtroom thriller such as this but there be also scene where they should have be add into the editing room the film be excellent in the beginning slow to crawl in the middle and pick up in the end if it stay like the beginning this film would have be flawless after 11 year old kid and his brother witness suicide the kid hire an attorney to help protect him and his family from threaten mafia member and stubborn federal district attorney the acting be very good in this film susan sarandon seem like she be bear to play this role she be just perfect for kid who never act before brad renfro be brilliant as the snobby 11 year old overall this be slightly above average crime thriller sarandon steal the show as her role of the attorney joel schumacher direct masterpiece compare to the batman film he would take over after this film rate this film 8 10
swoony eye boy girl stuff aid by the musical uplift although set in 1963 the popular music drive dirty dancing be betray by its false sense of nostalgia rarely have see movie which look so unlike what it be allegedly about however anachronisms aside the casting of patrick swayze and jennifer grey pay off these two definitely have the charisma the story require and their union be nearly credible plot have gawky young woman vacation in the catskills with her parent learn to loosen up with help from slightly old man who work as professional dancer two silly subplots one about an unwanted pregnancy and the other involve steal wallet just about render the melodramatics inherent in the scenario utterly superfluous who care about some guy wallet it just chew up time until the inevitable finale an enthusiastic celebratory climax and that where the picture can not go wrong 1 2 from

a decent but unspectacular holocaust movie the pianist be by the number movie about the life and time of pianist try to live through the nazi occupation of warsaw beautiful musical score predictably result the pianist himself be an altogether unsympathetic character we want him to live because we don want to be cruel but otherwise we wouldn have any particular attraction to this man the movie itself be strictly for the most part paint by number nazi be bad jew be innocent yet determine survivor well more to the point nazi be bad though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good heart the soviet on the other hand be uniformly bad and stupid it seem the lesson of the holocaust must never be forget however the pivotal lesson of the holocaust be not nazis be bad jew be innocent yet determine survivor those sort of lesson be historical detail along the line of the magna carta be sign in 1066 the real lesson of the holocaust center around what happen when we stop look at each other as human being and start look at each other as cartoon or stereotype this be by the number movie specifically because it do what most movie do it start with exist cartoon stereotype view and build character around them to tell story well movie would have begin in that place but then use the power and magic of film to challenge our preconception and our stereotype to truly convey and reinforce message of hope for humanity your life will not be any poor if you never see this movie but you win feel that you waste your time either if you do certainly doesn belong in the imdb top 250

police the police want to try to be as fair to this film as possible because it clear from the comedian interview in this film that criticism from anyone can be take very personally since this film isn about heckler so much as it be film critic it a bait and switch let address the latter comedy in general have always be hold fairly or unfairly to the same standard by most movie critic as an oscar nominate meryl streep film and that be unfortunate can be guilty of the same comparison however don see that change anytime soon and as long as adam sandler target audience remain 12 year old boys many critic be not go to recommend his film sure there may be caveat if you re pre teen but generally critic be look to recommend film not to genre specific buff or age group but to all audience unfortunately this isn really examine in this documentary heckler take an almost defeatist approach at the hand of film critic when actually there be solution use ebay or even imdb as prototype the buyer and seller on ebay and the critic here on imdb be grade by the reader or themselves thus help to weed out unnecessary incendiary and non constructive deal and or review do it work for movie review do audience have way to grade roger ebert or leonard maltin no but it likely to happen very soon would compare the current film critic industry to the news medium in general before profiteer become so prominent post cronkite the news medium and their personality have nearly lose any and all respectable viewer bill reilly draw 4 million viewer to win his 8 00 time slot but that only 1 4 of 1 percent of the population the 4th estate have be so inept and the difference between expert with special interest so intertwine that it take jon stewart to create what ve be call the 5th estate to police the 4th estate because they haven be do their job of work for the public but rather the government special interest or themselves and that where see the process of film criticism head toward state of viewer police and correct if necessary critic review like jamie kennedy base on what saw from the jamie kennedy experiment haven see any of his film but they don appear to be target at me there a place for silly farce slapstick and toilet humor the farrelly brother and there a place for very sharp dialog comedy with small but adult theme like the 40 year old virgin superbad and the hangover unfortunately kennedy film fall into the former category and it difficult to gain traction among critic who only want to recommend film to wider audience than the 12 18 year old demographic in the adam sandler vein heckler be not documentary would recommend because it film to be more of defensive commentary on kennedy movie or at least cathartic release for kennedy to confront his critic than anything constructive about critic of comedy which ironically and to it own point be self defeat the day will come when the poison arrow be grade jamie kennedy be not for everyone but that ok and great but like sandler and even vince vaughn david spade tina fey etc he need to realize this himself and the sooner the good
not so much disappointment as it be deeply unsatisfying in perfect world the convoluted mess call be number four could have be great it have all the trapping for success base off semi popular novel for teen fairly accomplish director in j caruso the produce talent of michael bay two hot young star in alex pettyfer and glee own dianna agron and an enigmatic yet intrigue trailer campaign so why be it that the final product be one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experience have have in some time open with the death of number three we jump into the life of john pettyfer an alien be protect on earth from group call the mogadorians as it turn out the mogadorians wipe out the population of john planet year before except for nine child with extraordinary power for some reason they have to be kill in order and with three down john be next in line for extermination as he go on the run with his protector henri timothy olyphant they settle into the small town of paradise ohio soon after john start gain and learn more about his power but with new love agron and his lust to just be normal throw into the mix john may be in more trouble than he can imagine have never read the source material for be number four but would hazard guess that it do half decent job of explain what be go on and do not just strive to set future sequel in motion the film on the other hand suffers because the sequel seem to be the only thing in mind outside of special effect we be thrown right into john life and we only get little nugget of reason for what be go on at any give time we never get full explanation and be never even offer the ability to piece it together by ourselves the film seem merely content give us hint offer little enigmatic moment to get us think but instead of do anything with these scene it merely continue truck along to its eventual end which promise continuation and the hope for some further reasoning for what be happen but if the filmmaker do not care about inform the audience now why will we care later but this would not be such slap in the face if we have not already see so many film in the past half decade do the exact same thing attempt to replicate the success of the harry potter twilight and the lord of the ring franchise the golden compass cirque du freak the vampire assistant the spiderwick chronicle and percy jackson the olympian the lightning thief which this film oddly resembles be all example of studio make film out of young adult book specifically to capitalize on the potential for sequel and lengthy franchise possibility they all fail in vary degree because they all suffer from the same thing be number four suffers from not enough plot too much dependence on sequel have all of these film even attempt to be able to stand on their own perhaps they would have get the sequel they seem to think they deserve know four be part of propose book franchise as oppose to an already establish book franchise but it merely skip the waiting in the middle for the eventual film should these plot and sequel problem not already be enough four suffers from copy twilight little too close even include the notable musical cue from current alt rocker sure there be no vampire but the romance between john and agron sarah feel little too force for comfort right in the middle of be hunt down to be systematically wipe out we be suppose to believe that someone who have spend their life run would simply fall in love out of the blue and not feel any consequence we be suppose to believe he do not know good sure he a teenager and we all do stupid thing when we be that young but why do the focus of the film seem to hinge on the chemistry and romance between these two star cross lover be intrigue from the early moment in the film where it start to set the plot into motion and the need for john and henri to keep run to avoid death but then it suddenly shift from science fiction tale to romantic love story and totally lose anything it have go for it last minute save in the final act of the film where it shift back into the realm of sci fi be not nearly enough to make up for well over an hour of melodrama and teen angst it be awkward silly and practically plagiarizes twilight will say be interested and intrigue when the film be attempt to do something with the plot and overarch story but these moment be never give the chance to fully develop the film criminally underuses olyphant the only actor who actually act in the entire film and make him into an almost useless background character we only get glimpse of teresa palmer character throughout the film the trailer already give away any mystery of who she might be and when she finally show up to do something she merely speak in overtly sexual allusion pettyfer and agron both seem to suffer from not know what emphasis to put on their character and when and relative newcomer callan mcauliffe be stick in the cliché ridden role as the know it all geek of best friend when it attempt to work be number four be quite interesting would have love more story and whole lot less romance even what do work include the decent special effect seem to suffer as result of all the melodramatic romance
a finale that fail to truly honor it hero rambo last blood be the supposedly the final film in the rambo series series that have certainly see good day last blood 39 title infers finale that could wrap the decade old series in nice little bow and call back to the film that start it all however it fail to truly honor its hero in satisfy way br br the first film first blood seem so tamed compare to this new entry and look back the series as whole have change along the way first blood be film base on the novel of the same name that follow man struggle to reenter society after the vietnam war it be topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veteran receive upon return home first blood be film with scene of violence but it be not an action film it be as far as can see an anti war film every film after this have fail to understand what this film be about and have opt for more action heavy series and violent one at that br br last blood be first blood 39 polar opposite it relish in its violence especially in the 3rd act but at least in this film the reason and motive be clear and can be understand last blood be not concern with tell the story of man haunt by war or tell an anti war story its focus be on violent revenge and have to look at it this way the rambo series have transform itself into something completely different from the first film so do this work as revenge thriller br br would say yes in the most simplistic sense this be the story of man who want to live his final year in peace but be call to action once again to protect someone he love it 39 a story we know all too well however it have prove an emotionally resonant story in the past rambo 39 story in this film and his goal be simple and it 39 simple to fault but this film be not concern with its story as much as it be the action this series have become know for br br let 39 talk about the action win 39 lie it 39 fun the third act be insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us this would be fine other stallone movie have indulge in violence before and that 39 the main selling point his expendibles trilogy be great example but last blood try for something more and lay the seed for what should be an emotional crescendo for our john rambo but the film doesn 39 do enough to make this satisfying and so the film end up feel unbalanced br br rambo 39 relationship with his niece be the heart of the film and help in at least give an emotional connection the film sorely need however these be about the only character that have any form of depth the villain be 1 dimensional and nothing more and be there simply to be part of an endless army for rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which be fun the film however have save grace in the form of stallone and his performance stallone have always be an underrated actor and believe it hasn 39 be until recently that he 39 be receive some of the recognition he deserve br br the movie problem perhaps be result of its extremely short length if anyone know about the making of this film it be constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minute the short rambo film to date believe in long version of this film lie film that be much good that balance out its more meditative moment with its burst of violence br br as it stand the film feel unbalance and have an extremely slow and bore first two act that end on an action pack finale and the the final moment of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up be these last few moment be the best part of the film and make it feel more like finale perhaps an extended version of the film could be release to fix many of these film short coming but we 39 ll have to wait and see br br overall rambo last blood be film that have the right stuff to make this finale great but what be there be either not enough or cut down to reach certain runtime stallone 39 performance make it at least worth watch as it try it 39 best to blend the series violent aspect with the more character drive first film

the ultimate pink floyd dvd give this dvd an 8 out of 10 give the film itself 7 the dvd adhere to pink floyd standard very creative and thorough one of the best feature be an off the cuff commentary by roger water and gerald scarfe who be obviously good friend be an ardent pink floyd fan all my life there be poignant bit of water personal history discuss in relation to the semi autobiographical film for instance never really know that most of the album wish you be here be about water loss of his friend and former band mate syd barrett water also start joke during scene where bob geldof be up against the large brick wall in the film elude to the ira the film itself look great with the wall soundtrack mostly remixed and re record for the film provide great aural experience there be 2 documentary one produce around the time it be make and recent retrospect these also provide insight into the concept and execution of the film also feature be the deleted hey you which be cut from the film to move the story along despite it be one of the more popular song from the album scarfe strike artwork and movie still be also include the film itself really be like an extended music video the imagery elude to water childhood compliment by psychotic animation produce by scarfe it also fall victim to some of the trapping of an mtv video such as hall full of skinhead do dance move hokey or major character in weird makeup look into the camera the main theme repeat themselves throughout the film mainly because the music itself wallow in it loneliness saw this film 3 time when it come out while be in high school after watch it again about 18 year later realise that should be aware of the materialistic aspect of barricade yourself behind the wall of toy available these day 13 channel of sh now be 123 channel of sh with thing like the internet we be increasingly live virtual life instead of real one
a simple summary without the spoiler what you need to know we live in time where super hero movie be all the rage who doesn love good super hero throw down cool origin story and awesome villain while decent hero flick be easy enough to find occasionally masterpiece like the dark knight will come along and in the process wow the critic and audience alike and then we get deadpool where to start with this one to give it some comparison it make batman and robin look like an academy award winner by comparison how be that quite simply put the movie be terrible in every sense of the word deadpool be untrue to its source material and to the very character himself the character be know for his violence and humor throughout his comic book tv show and video game appearances the filmmaker in their apparent effort to make the character more edgy and appeal more to adult have strip him of this instead replace the comedy and fun with crude dialogue sex sex more sex and more foul word than possibly all of eminem and lil wayne album combine and all of this without any of the substance that have make wade wilson adventure and misadventure alike over the year so memorable exciting and laugh out loud funny no wit and no soul it insult the intelligence of its audience and then expect them to pay we ve come long way in term of the quality of super hero film to call this step back could potentially be the big understatement of the year for those who have be wait for good deadpool film this unfortunately be not it perhaps the best on screen appearance to date can be find in the animated short hulk s wolverine but for the time be we re still go to have to wait for our favorite merc with the mouth to get the big screen sensation that he deserve
not bad not good either this movie be meh it introduce some new character but it be kind of boring be fan of the series and the first movie be really great this one have me fall asleep all the time it be not what expect at all would never rewatch it like do with the first movie but it be not terrible it be ok guess
for the low common denominator be fan of the comic be greatly disappointed in what the wachowski bros do to the story not much of the original be intact other than the basic plot subtle hint to s identity be now blatant sign and the almost hidden love story be now sappy romance novel and the dark gritty aesthetic of the comic be now slick glossy matrix style hollywood even if you haven read the comic this movie be lack in the way it try to be subversive by hit you over the head with it morality when it begin to become thought provoke rather than let you form your own opinion it blatantly show you the way this could have be do in much more subdued manner rather than as an action movie with high end special effect
should have pick one plot so the good part the acting be generally on point most of the cinematography be great and really like the slow burn approach mostly and take individually each of the three story could have make decent movie unto itself but for some inexplicable reason the producer decide to try to mesh together three storyline that have virtually nothing to do with each other and in the process none of them be fully flesh out ve read some of the glow review on here and for the life of me can figure out what they re see that m not m not simpleton that need to have every plot device explain to me have no problem with abstract concept imply relationship or thing happen off screen in film but this movie be either about an ancient subterranean entity in asia scary s childhood legend that may have turn out to be real or secretive cult that have somehow be manipulate people thought and or create people to use for its own nefarious but undefined purpose it try but fail to be about all of them at once tire try so hard to make sense of these three disparate storyline but finally give up if the movie can make them line up any good than it do then why should kill myself try intentionally obscure storytelling be not the same thing as be avant garde for all this movie strengths it can not overcome poor plot you should wait until it on some streaming service and try and decode it then but don pay to go see it
too many shockingly bad technical inaccuracy whilst go in sixty second have pretty fabulous cast and an acceptably punchy plot simply can not forgive the glare technical inaccuracy now m not the sort of person who would usually let bit of artistic licence get in the way of my enjoyment of motion picture but this movie really stretch my tolerance for the portrayal of all thing automotive 1 none of the car be steal seem to have any kind of steer column lock why be this 2 the entry method to many of these exotic vehicle be laughably unrealistic 3 why do none of these very expensive car have engine immobilisers basic ford have such device 4 the ludicrous nitrous oxide boost scene where cage jump huge set of roadworks without trash the car and or kill himself be for me where this movie jump the shark no pun intend my friend and watch this film squint and squirm all the way through at the chronic lack of attention to detail it just isn good enough to rely on good cast and shiny car to carry an entire movie some kind of research into car theft might have be good start hire an ex car thief as consultant maybe it not rocket science potentially good movie ruin by lazy direction and production 4 star out of 10 from me m afraid
incredible performance sensitive script no matter your opinion on the subject it go to be difficult to get through you don know jack it understandable though biopic of dr jack kevorkian and his work be bind to bother everyone since the debate on euthanasia be intense and personal if this television movie didn make people cry it wouldn have be well do al pacino shine in the lead completely camouflage himself in the role and make audience believe he really be dr kevorkian m sure even his great critic think his performance be an inspired transformation with none of his usual trademark if you re fan of his acting and you re in the mood for an extremely heavy film rent this one and pick up box of tissue with strong support cast include susan sarandon john goodman brenda vaccaro as well as an intelligent thoughtful sensitive script this be one of those film that you watch once think incredibly highly of and never want to watch again just warn though if you re staunchly anti euthanasia you re probably not go to like this movie this be film that celebrate the compassion strength and courage of dr kevorkian kiddy warn obviously you have control over your own child however due to adult subject matter wouldn let my kid watch it
the end of the journey the journey come to an end for me the final installment ensure that the lord of the ring replaces star war as my favourite fantasy movie franchise in time the film will look dated but the story and characterisation far surpass that of star war the empire strike back be the only one of the star war film that be in the same league as lor as with two tower the return of the king doesn recap the story so far so don even think of see this film if you re unfamiliar with the story it start with flashback to smeagol and mean andy serkis get to appear on the finish print frodo sam and smeagol then continue on their quest whilst the remain member of the fellowship be briefly reunite at isengard before take different path to minas tirith the action be unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time be over 3 hour as with the previous film the combination of set model and cgi brings middle earth to life suspect quite few of the performer will be in with chance of oscar recognition miranda otto be the stand out performer and be outstanding as eowyn and surely deserve the best supporting actress honour m sure that viggo mortensen ian mckellen elijah wood sean astin and orlando bloom will all have their supporter for act honour and rightly so as they all put in fine performance m not sure whether andy serkis be elligable but suspect the success of smeagol gollum owe as much to him as the animator bernhard hill should also be in with shout for recognition for his performance as king theoden my guess be that it ll miss out on the acting award with the exception of miranda otto it absolutely certain to take best director best picture and string of technical award though my guess be that it will be nominate for about 12 category and take 8 gong return of the king isn flawless however saruman be cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film we therefore miss out on the final face off between gandalf and saruman at isengard this be certainly film and will no doubt be on the extended edition when the hobbit return to the shire it look remarkably like when they leave no sign that saruman have arrive back before them and take over in the book merry pippin sam and frodo help rally the rest of the hobbit to retake the shire but at some cost to both the hobbit and the environment merry pippin and sam become hero to the rest of the hobbit who be largely unaware of frodo adventure and exploit m not sure if any of this be shoot but it would be welcome addition to the extended addition personally would have follow tolkien and get rid of 7 minute of arwen footage and keep saruman in bearing in mind christopher lee passion for the trilogy it be also sad to see him remove from the final episode m quite sure peter jackson must have have few sleepless night over that decision if saruman exclusion be the big blunder of the film gimli consignment to comic interlude be also bit disappointing m not against bit of light hearted relief every so often especially in such long film but it seem that every time gimli appear on screen it be for light entertainment the that still only count as one line to legolas be very funny though despite these gripe peter jackson can certainly be very proud of the lord of the ring very few people think it possible to do justice to the book he have craft film that many people will enjoy for many year
my favourite zombie film this side of pittsburgh off the block let me just say that be huge zombie fan so don make statement like the above lightly secondly let me say that this be an italian zombie film and fulci only direct 15 minute of it before hand over to bruno rat night of terror mattei this be no dawn of the dead folk that say this be easily one of the most entertaining zombie film have ever see the script be wonderfully horrible just check out the two scientist try to find an antidote let try put these two molecule together the zombie come in all variety from moan shuffler to machete wield maniac to bird the gore be plentiful leg be bite off arm amputate stomachs burst open the pace be fast fly from one zombie attack to the next then there the head in the fridge oh the head in the fridge one of the great moment in horror since ash get his hand possess in evil dead 2 you should know already whether you re the sort of person who go to like this sort of film get some mate and some beer and you ll be in for fun night do mention the head in the fridge

a lot of excess footage in this one like seven samurai well than rashomon 1950 by the same author probably because it have plot the approach be similar though lead to more than third of the movie be excess footage two hour director cut would most likely have be watchable piece of cinema but we ll never be able to verify my claim the question remain why be this one of the best movie by one of the best director of all time apart from lot people tell you so decade of repeat lead this mantra to become an unquestionable truth but d like to point out that critic might be wrong after all one of the more recent example be sofia coppola somewhere 2010 you watch it and wonder why the accolade but guess the critic always need something to talk about even when it put some of the viewer to sleep
good movie bad political message let put aside the obvious artistic achievement of this movie thoroughly describe in other comment and look at the political side of it perhaps in other time 5 10 year ago this side would be not of any importance today however when it obvious that fascism be quickly gain momentum in the s follow by other country like uk this movie have too many parallel to the reality that can be ignore look from this angle the movie play very negative role and its message play for the evil party it actually 100 american way people live under fascistic regime don really need to do anything someone will promptly come over to the rescue and he will crash the regime use few karate kick and few explosion no need to unite no need to organize to struggle no need for revolutionary medium or any other effort or risk in the right time everyone will be give mask to conveniently hide the identity in case thing go wrong then somehow everyone will be on the street without any visible organizational effort then couple of explosion and the regime will crash nice and easy solution without any real effort so we can continue enjoy reality show on the tube while our troop kill iraqis by thousand in our name and on our money in the right time the superman will come over and clean our mess for us

beauty be only skin deep everybody love this picture they praise the look of it and indeed it look beyond awesome from technical point of view it be nothing short of flawless but unfortunately beauty be only skin deep and if one manage to look past the the cinematography he she will find that the story be nothing special in fact compare to the praise this movie be receive it feel like it be fraud basically it be the journey of dicaprios character from near death to moment of revenge but if you take into account what his character go trough he should be dead already from exposure or pneumonia half way trough instead amongst other thing he rid horse off cliff and fall hundred of foot without get new scratch next to the scar make by bear also the plenitude of nature shot which be there to pound in the viewer the severity of the hero situation despite be beautiful be so excessive that good one hour of the 156 minute runtime of this movie could have be cut out without any actual loss to the story the director be also push the boundary with the flashback and hallucination scene just for the sake of back story and motivational exposition give the depth or lack there of of the story the movie should have be around 90 minute flat instead of an almost 3 hour long epic honestly when be not bore by the national geography shot be hat this movie with passion find it to be pretentious hollow with badly write character and way too long for its own good also in about 2 3 year of time nobody be go to talk about this movie unless the topic be not the fact that dicaprio still do not receive an oscar yet quite frankly can not imagine anybody to want to re watch this movie again give its length unless he she be glutton for punishment could go on and on about why find this movie to be soo bad but it would become mindless rant and do not like that it be basically the posh version of avatar be just wonder when will people see this
cronenberg drag race lonnie lucky man johnson be an veteran drag racer and head honcho of his race team that sponsor by fastco oil their business man phil adamson think only of the sponsorship than win and when lonnie hotrod explode phil isn too happy see that lonnie be the one who draw the crowd phil get lonnie to take over bill the kid broker car which doesn go down to well with bill their rival team lead by gary the blacksmith black would like the chance to beat lonnie and thing do heat up when adamson decide he want to make some change when you think of the name david cronenberg do drag race come straight to mind most definitely not but on this occasion he have churn out rather normal exploitation flick on the sport you don always associate the word normal to his name but even though its an entertaining piece it really nothing much out of the ordinary that probably the best reason why it fly under radar well it win escape the fan of the director work though cronenberg excursion into fast company be pretty much low budget film that market for more mainstream audience didn really know about this film that pretty much come out of the blue when find out it be direct by cronenberg so ve be itch to get my hand on it and gladly come across the 2 disc special edition release at my local library m no revhead fan but couldn help but get draw into the thick of the action thanks largely to mark irwin cinematography actually didn mind this little picture but you still call it rather hot and cold detour the film look great with it semi documentary style where there be lot of creative angel shot that catch the action superbly and the beautiful canadian landscape that fill the frame also leave mark in your mind cronenberg manage to stage the set piece involve the dragsters quite well as you watch some burn rubber along with the crowd it just like the real deal but when it wasn focus on the race it become the usual the good guy bad guy theme where it become morally hound and predictable you feel the tension between the team and the plot show the manipulative nature of sponsorship deal take over the show but the drama element run low on fuel it just feel leaden with simple script that doesn really seem to go anywhere with some underwritten plot detail but still there a nice amount of sharp humour evident the film conclusion might be excite but still it rather illogical you could say the howling rock soundtrack that surround the film felt overly tacky and get bit repetitious the performance from the main two lead lift most of the act out of the standard mould william smith and john saxon make the most out of their character material saxon be great character actor and he steal the film as the slimly sponsor adviser phil adamson smith add steady head to the veteran driver lonnie johnson also in the supporting role be the gorgeous claudia jennings as lonnie love interest sammy nicholas campbell play the up and come youngster bill broker and cedric smith play the competition gary the blacksmith black there definitely lot of stun gal in this picture well car and girl go down rather nicely don they rather middle affair that have it perk when it close to the action that when it hit it stride by make you feel like you re there it nothing overly showy but it a mildly entertaining romp for the undemanding

rather dull the inexplicable winner of the grand prix du festival international du film equivalent of the palme or at the 1971 cannes film festival the go between 1970 be to degree love story romance film don typically interest me unless there some kind of twist to it in this case there appear to be potential in tell it from the perspective of young boy supposedly junior sorcerer who act as messenger between two lover one be julie christie and face an ethical dilemma in assist what essentially adultery element of class inequality be touch on ala don feel the film quite realize its potential what relevance there be to the boy dabble in magic may come across in the book but in the film it seem immaterial and largely unexplored the drama concern the main plot rarely materializes aside from one scene where the boy be interrogate shrewdly by an old lady about inconsistency as to who he bring message to we only have one small hissy fit throw by christie when the boy refuse to deliver letter what we re leave with be mainly slow uneventful look at the english countryside with most character be polite but grey and dull and hard to empathize with cannes have good than this
great cast interesting premise but poorly execute accord to the book and the marketing of this film it all base on true story honestly don really care because that be not sell point for me what attract me to the film be the cast know jason statham doesn have the best track record when it come to the quality of the movie he star in but when add dominic purcell clive owen and the great robert de niro to me it worth the shot killer elite do not live up to the expectation such cast would inspire they establish quick connection between the men in the beginning then dive right into the story it kinda set up like heist movie for which you desperately want them to succeed even though they re not steal anything but be kill people the film do have action sequence and nice opening scene but then it fall flat and get bore for while the story be weak and repetitive and the cast do nothing to elevate it statham barely shine in the action scene owen be so bland in his portrayal of trained killer dominic purcell sport an english accent be weird but if only he look confident do it he wouldn have make joke of himself and de niro be hardly in the movie the only redeeming quality killer elite have be the historical geopolitical aspect behind the story killer elite be disappointment for me it be barely entertaining and run too long 120min

example of masterful film noir over the year people have call chinatown one of the best movie ever don quite agree with that statement but there be no deny that the movie be masterpiece may not find it one of the best film all time but do find it as one of the best film of 1974 this noir film hearken back to the day where similar film be produce leave and right but start from the 1960 this genre slowly begin to fade away the film may come across as really take its time to tell the story but the thriller have lot of tension that build up to its climatic end this film bring public awareness to some issue people may not have really know about water be commodity for human survival and whoever control the water control the money this movie be complex series of event surround the control of water and that people can die over this issue ah the wonder of be human be the movie be complicate follow so don lose yourself in any train of thought or you might lose what will happen plot wise boast one of cinema all time great screenplay by robert towne and powerful lead performance by jack nicholson you be in for fantastic time as mention briefly the film plot can be complex as the film will turn down completely different path in heartbeat jake gittes jack nicholson be private investigator who specialize in matrimonial affair one day he get visit from woman claim to be evelyn mulwray she tell jake that her husband be cheat on her and she would like jake to investigate her claim he do his job by take photograph of him and he catch him with another woman that ensue scandal and gittes be confront by the real evelyn mulwray faye dunaway when the husband show up dead gittes be lead deeper and deeper in web of deceit lie and murder this movie be give its voice by variety of element such as robert towne fantastic screenplay or roman polanksi visionary directing style but let not forget about the wonderful performance include the tour de force performance by screen legend jack nicholson nicholson performance be nothing short of excellent as he portray jake gittes love how the movie give in depth characterization to this character gittes may not be the nice man in the world but he a man of honor and honesty the movie be all about lie and that form rather bleak mental state for gittes all we want to do be find the truth and move on but that seem impossible to do with all the lie and murder nicholson be nominate for an oscar for his performance and some might say he should have won who can forget that scene at the river bed where he be slash in the nose by this random creep faye dunaway also deliver an amazing performance on the outside her character make you believe she be good but she have some fishy motif about her gittes fall in love with her but he can take her sneaky lie then we have the performance of john huston the legendary director who play evelyn father his character noah cross be the antagonist of the film one would say as he want to use his wealth to control the water that dinner scene between noah and jake be quite something noah and his mean beady eye be put to good use this film be direct by roman polanski before he be extradite to europe and could only make film there this movie have him return back to the director chair only few year after the brutal murder of his wife and unborn child love his sense of direction and he really capture the noir feeling you would find in the film of the 1940 his conflict with the screenwriter robert towne become somewhat famous towne have the film end with happy end but polanksi go against that the end be not happy one as we get some unfortunate death from the wrong people but it be an effective end nonetheless no matter what robert towne write one of the best screenplay of all time and that will endure for many many year into our future even though chinatown be fictional movie it base of the los angeles water grab of 1908 this be city that form in desert and it should be impossible for water to exist which make the control of the water ever more so fundamental towne do great job add his own 1930 spin to the story this movie be undeniably great film the pace crawl at time but the content of the story keep me captivate this be not an action thriller but it one of those slow burn thriller focus on tell top rate story the film fire on all cylinder because of it wonderful act and solid direction but we also have great but sad trumpet infuse score from jerry goldsmith and cinematography from john alonzo that capture the a of old in very effective way let not forget about the award win screenplay from robert towne nominate for 11 oscar this film be worth watch this be fantastic thriller that rely upon excellent storytelling my grade
emotional roller coaster amaze movie love every second of it get goosebump during certain part of the movie amaze acting by jim carrey it show how ignorant some people can be and how they be miss out on life due to work and commitment you should know when to say yes and no so many lesson learn from it one of my favorite from now onward the perspective at which the movie be look at be plain amaze the movie start off with depressed character who miss out on life lot who eventually learn that life be not about stay indoors and living loner life its about make memory and keep memory perfect when you be go through rough time show how exactly life should be live also recommend watch zindagi na milegi dobara it a hindi movie but it just as beautiful as this movie live your life guy
horror without the blood and gut if you re tire of the modern horror film that depend almost entirely upon the shock value of body dismemberment demonic spirit gallon of blood etc etc give yourself the treat of watch this film the acting and character development heighten the effect there be even element of compassion and mercy cleverly intertwine with the main theme how refresh the most unnerving and frighten story hit us too close to home ie this could really happen there no way to laugh this one off
this movie will haunt me for awhile it just so sad and also bit terrify my wife work as nurse in an alzheimer ward and she say this be the most realistic depiction of the disease she have ever see she also say in her opinion it should be require view for anyone that work with alzheimer or dementia patient what movie
just wait for the dvd first and foremost d like to say that go to see this because m huge fan of the simpson but like some fan be disappoint first they make bart into soft emo piece of h t not the brat we use to know not enough emphasis on the other character such as chief wiggum ralph and so for it second there barely any gag other than the one see on the trailer the only reason give it 5 out of 10 be that they keep the goofy homer we love otherwise in conclusion it not total flop but this should ve come long ago so my advice be just wait for the dvd which should come out for the holiday
i feel like everybody have miss the point be not normally one to write review but couldn help read several for this film on this site that just do seem to understand where think the film be suppose to be come from the majority of the complaint saw be that the film be too depress for child film but whilst see where they be come from in some regard every child who have see watch this film work in cinema have absolutely love it and laugh out loud almost constantly they be not old enough to realise the message the film be try to convey that life isn all about happiness applaud the attempt from pixar to make film that be not only hilarious in place but be also major comment on what life be like to be young teenager transition through one of the most important moment of life from more personal perspective why should everything we show our child gloss over the reality of life and try to make them believe everything be rosy 24 7 again what this film do brilliantly through the message take away at the end be that life will never be 100 full of happiness but that be fine why do it have to be little bit of sadness be necessary if person be never sad they would be inhumane overall then suppose my review be more of comment on the type of film we exhibit to child and how the nanny state we live in look to protect them from most of life inevitability either way what can be ignore be that this film be equal part sad and equal part what be sure will become timeless classic in year to come

crap now here we have really bad pretentious dutch artistic come on movie this boring o be soo reveal as to where it be go this guy make another dutch classic call philene be sorry with the same actress kim van kooten and that film be maybe bad but this one come in close can not believe that his film be be take seriously it be suppose to be film about guy film his sister in video format while he be constantly talk frustrate text into the mic commenting on his sister behaviour before the lens very corny be the transition between scene in which he show us some noise perfectly put into the montage it be to give you the impression of spontaneousness this as well be how this product the film zusje come to an end with noise dutch critic especially at pretentious film festival in the lowland hail these kind of film as very interesting creative and totally now it make you shiver
forgettable harley quinn movie the movie be not that bad but to be honest it a movie about harley everyone else pale in front of her knew that there will be feminism but the whole movie be about feminism which imo be too much would categorize the movie as dc version of deadpool but it win be quite accurate it must be see to be understand there be some pretty creative approach some not so much the story be not very impressive but think it expect nothing really special black mask get exactly one comicbook scene kinda everything else about him be just strange the action be probably the best part of the movie the music somehow fit into the overall atmosphere there re 2 3 strike consider that be expect to be total waste of time can say it be bore but not disappointing as suicide squad would say that it forgettable harley quinn movie at best

didn do too much for me but mostly from subjective perspective the award win akira be japanese animated movie from 1988 so this one have its 30th anniversary last year and it be write and direct by katsuhiro ôtomo who be in his early 30s at that point and it be probably still his most known career effort as of today even if he have also work on other fairly well know film the cast list can not say anything about really probably only the big anime japanese movie fan will be familiar with the name and that be alright good voice actor be never as famous as good live action actor but that do not mean in any way they be worse the one here do an okay job overall for this film that run for slightly over 2 hour as for the western world there be animated movie that be only for kid and animated movie that be for grown ups as well as kid but virtually no animated movie only for adult this be definitely different when it come to japan for this country there be full sub genre of film that be animate and not suitable for child not because of sexual content most of the time but because of the violence this be one of them as for sexual content we only have female breast expose on one occasion but ton of bloodshed and violence really this be one of the problem have with this movie indirectly would say because the film be incredibly tense and not in good way people say wrongfully that it be not good if nothing happen in movie but the exact opposite we get here be nothing to be desire either because there be no moment to take breath for the audience really and personally do not like it also it do not feel too realistic if always something happen something crucial that be apparently and this be the case here anyway one of the more interesting thing to me here be that while the film be make in the 80s there be reference to the future what the futuristic tokyo will look like and funnily they pick the year 2019 exactly to depict it okay it not on space odyssey oder dark angel level but still kinda funny even if obviously they be exaggerate so much here that it be hard to believe this be what they think the year 2019 would look like think we can be glad that it be not like this in reality and also that there be no world war iii as mention early in this film okay what else do like about the movie the animation be okay it be not entirely to my like but there be moment enjoy and can see why some really adore it it obviously not miyazaki studio ghibli in term of look and approach but it succeed to deliver in other department more through style than cuteness like the set and depiction of the broken city honestly more than the people look especially those with change skin color find bit strange but guess it be also partially to emphasize their power and how different they be to normal human another thing find really cool be the red motorbike and also the red uniform one character be wear still what be up with the sticker advertize anyway don care too much it still look swell now for the negative and there be lot more for sure than positive at least for me but like say in the title of my review lot of it be subjective must say really struggle with the character and their introduction especially early on it felt like mess to me with how many be include really and how each and every one get scene or two and then some be never see again also in term of edit the film be so so fast that there be never really camera shot and angle that last for more than few second of course this fit in well with the speed attach to this film in general in term of motorbike and superpower and fighting because some of the character be super fast but still this be certainly not my preferred approach at the end it be bit improved as there be finally good focus on the character and not too many of them anymore still there be character like the officer who do not have really enough elaboration before that to make the impact they be suppose to make and also where be he go eventually like vanish completely and not in the creature think also think it be weird decision by the two or maybe even all three tiny powerful character to just jump in there to save the young man and boom he be save in the end but nobody else be why would they trade their life for him sure he fought hard and give it his all but he be not deity or something and the quote at least we can save the young man this way be not enough for me think many people who rat this film so highly that it be still barely in the imdb top250 forget about some of the mediocrity earlier on and the rather weak first 75 minute and do so because the end be really spectacular and admittedly what the test subject turn into at the end or almost the end look pretty memorable also pretty disgust but how we hear he can not control his body anymore also show that while he probably be the main antagonist he be also some sort of victim and it be bold decision to let the girl die that he suck in and other character but to me it hardly make an emotional impact same for the moment when the good main character of course survives and his friend welcome him and be really happy he be still there also do not like the little light and piece of energy he eventually turn into and it be too much of an easy way out maybe the feel good easy way out and kinda interesting but do it make sense that he turn into something so tiny after we hear he bascially create new universe before that they do it well with scarlett johansson transformation into pure energy not too long ago guess but let not drift too far away from this one here give it thumb down overall and be little bit but not too much surprise when people clap the moment the closing credit roll in then again with the type of people in the audience be not too surprised but even if do not like the movie as much still think it be well watch on the big screen where get the chance to see it than on small laptop screen or so but it be definitely nowhere near my top250 probably not even in my top250 from 1988 let alone from the 80s don recommend check it out if you still want it probably help if dragon ball be more your thing than pokemon in term of idea and story oh and finally also few word on the title again negative one sadly it be short and catchy yes and from that perspective probably help the film to garner more attention but akira never felt like define concept or character to me compare to some others that would have be good choice to name the film after in an accurate scenario it would be that akira be significant enough to say yes this be the character that they should have pick for the title however the way it be here be the other way around name the film after akira give pretty forgettable character some additional significance that would be all

a tough pill to swallow watchman will have you choke and gasp for air as the third act roll around in any sort of entertainment you need to finish strong your song speech video game movie television show need to finish out on top wrap thing up nicely whether optimistically or pessimistically method of entertainment can start slow maybe even build slow but should not at any give moment finish slowly or in weak matter watchman unfortunately fail to do this and it bad consider that the subject matter be such highly acclaim one while watchman be tough pill to swallow in the beginning and the middle it become unbearably awful in the final act and quite frankly demolishes any chance of this match up to the comic book we so love watchman be about retired group of superheroes come together after the murder of one of their own the comedian with the silent investigation head by rorschach jackie earle haley he reveal that the murder be part of something much big than just random act of violence in the meantime the other superheroes be have lot of trouble adapt to real life after their fame and fortune pass while the united state be inch away from nuclear war the theme explore here and unlike that of the typical comic book fare theme of fate god destiny war apocalypse and sacrifice be crucial to the entire plot and throughout the film remain hot topic david hayter and alex tse have the tough job of be able to translate the massive comic book into film within suitable run time let at least praise the effect while blue male bearing it all dozen of time isn exactly to my like the special effect in watchman be indeed quite spectacular while it lack the visual style and edge of 300 or sin city they remain sight to see the highly stylized fight aren as lengthy as zack snyder previous comic adaptation but be still fun to watch the hit strike and beatdowns be especially gruesome cringe worthy in some instance zack snyder know what keep his audience rivet and sprinkle few nasty fight from time to time to keep us on our toe the act itself be grand as well especially that of jackie earle haley who play rorschach not only be his character the best flesh out character but also be the one that steal the spotlight the most with good delivery funny one liner and more raw emotion than any other actor and actress on screen everyone else do respectable job although some of the extra be laughable when they shouldn be watchman downfall be definitely the complexity of it all while complex story be rivet most of the time you must be able to guide the audience in certain direction so that it doesn look like the film be suffer seizure and be mix up the chronological order like shuffling of card the pacing of the film be extremely slow and like to reach into the past without give you hintage of warn it become linger and even annoy at time although it do develop the main character bit more the pacing be uneven because quick pace fight be blend in with the slow scene of excessive dialogue backstory and character progress with the exception of rorschach there be little to care about we don feel much of connection with the character snyder do decent job explain lot in few moment see the opening credit but then add unnecessary scene and elongate scene then come the third act the entire film fall apart like bad game of jenga the pace totally grind into halt the end come much too slowly nothing be explain no emotion will come out of you there be unnecessary fight and quite frankly we the audience just flat out stop care for anyone literally you have to have extensive knowledge of the comic book in order to have good appreciation of the whole body of work itself however it a flaw for us as an audience to have to do research in order to receive full enjoyment out of film people start walk out of the theater people start squirm more in their seat and as the credit roll silence fill the cinema bottom line in order to watch the watchman and actually care you must read watchman it sound very obvious but the dark knight be well accept and love film and can guarantee you that most of the viewer hadn honesty read batman comic book the difference be we care for batman and his companion in this case we honestly don because they try explain so much and choose the wrong thing to explain lead to character with weak and little development unnecessary scene and lack of connection with our hero the theme be explore but not fully flesh out the plot itself be accurate but also lack true interpretation and the final act just damage the entire film zack snyder have the energy to make comic book scream to life with entertainment as prove in 300 but just didn end watchman well at all the end may alienate some but will frustrate more 150 minute be long enough no need to make it bad by drag it by its knuckle beware of slow pacing and very convoluted complicate plot that will require previous knowledge multiple viewing and lot of patience then tolerance for disappointment
not as good as it could have be most of this movie it seem revolve around scene in garage where the lead actor tell the audience what they re go to do the actual do be then reduce to quick almost montage like scene of the car be steal the film be essentially car chase at the end pad out with lot of mostly unimportant dialogue and scenes the rest of the movie as an example the pace of the movie grind to halt when have find the key for three mercedes car they need the dog swallow them there then an entirely unfunny set of scene involve ex lax and wait for the dog to crap out the key all the while you keep hop the movie will continue but it doesn until the dog poops up the key the film be save only by the final car chase which rival anything the matrix series have provide and which have the only half way decent cinematic portrayal of what compress gas cylinder will do if the valve snap off also save grace be vinnie jones awful actor but you can help but like him anyway his few scene be worth look out for and that about it for gi60s mostly dull with few spot of brightness and good car chase at the end

worst movie have ever see have just write one review but this awful movie deserve one this be absolutely incredible but seem that lot of people like it do not find anything funny in it nor action nor story nor the way the story be tell nor the script that be horrible this be flat movie without any depth the most superficial movie have ever see you simply can find any knowledge nor inspiration nor entertainment in it it be great black hole you ll only spend time watch it there be no way to find something interest in this movie except some second in bowl scene can find any interesting point of interest in this movie and the hilarious part be that it be recommend to me by two friend of mine there be something wrong in this world that be not aware about
good but not pixar good what like about pixar they generally cover each of these level 1 the setting 2 the story 3 the character 4 drama 5 humor 6 visuals in the case of up the humor be not at all on par with previous pixar release but the big problem be with the setting of the story e the world they create in monster inc they could invent anything because it be fictitious world in toy story the toy could do anything but the human be generally bind to the same physical law as the rest of us that where up make gigantic misstep the main character be render very realistically visually but do the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn run pull house excuse me where do the talk dog collar come from the villain be portray as realistic human but it make no sense that he might live in the rain forest alone invent talk dog collar he an explorer not an engineer this be clearly just something pixar pull out of their funny idea to stick in movie someday jar they should have look to see if it fit first there be some move scene stunningly render but as cohesive long feature it fail
imaginative fun and move as close to perfect as pixar have ever be carl frederickson ed asner have live long life but dream of adventure to south america he want to spend his remain day in his home but new high rise be be construct around it after chance accident carl lose his home and be set to be take into retirement home unhappy with this idea the former balloon salesman tie thousand of balloon to his house and simply float away en route to his dream adventure except he be not alone young wilderness explorer russell jordan nagai inadvertently show up in mid air and carl see no other choice but to bring the boy with him the fact that this plot line be even relevant enough to get make into movie be more than enough reason to praise up ever since toy story pixar have consistently deliver the most radically original and unique idea for animated film and live action film sure not all of them be as amazing as others car be quite simply stale compare to the like of ratatouille and wall but there be something brilliantly imaginative and excite go on at the studio and up be no exception come off the breakthrough of wall i be not expect the same reaction to up but be more than just pleasantly surprise the film be hilarious heartfelt move and depress all at once this may sound like it be an issue and that the film have problem hold its ground with its tonal structure but instead it handle it quite well split the film into quadrant and allow the theme and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmaker be go for and while there be plenty for young child to enjoy and take from the film it be the old audience that will get the big reaction from it there be lot go on in the film but it never lose its speed and never lose control of what it want to say and do it know exactly where it want to be and when and where other recent pixar film have fail specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out up do not it practically blast its way through its begin all the way up to its end with time leave to spare what make up work so well much like wall before it be the focus on very few character where wall spend the majority of its runtime primarily on earth with its main character love interest and cockroach up spend its majority with carl russell bird name kevin and talk dog name dug voice by co director bob peterson it do allow for more character to enter in later on but the focus never stray from these main character some may say the film be try to tell multiple story but as the film progress it be clear it be tell one story the tale of man who never experience what he want the most the film build up carl backstory heavily in startlingly move moment that surprisingly be surprisingly keep rather secretive in the marketing for the film we know from the very first trailer that carl be fairly mean old man but the film spend great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of man but the real success of the film be in its imagination and adventure while wall be perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade up still manage to pack in lot of uniqueness but while wall get catch up in its own environmentally sound message up stick with be an almost straight adventure picture it be frequently thrill and excite and let up only for few moment at time for such an old character the film really stun with some of its fantastical idea sure it be obvious this be film that could only ever be do as an animated film but what it lack in realism it make up for in fun something that have be sorely miss from the movie for year it come back for short while with the first pirate of the caribbean film but the focus as of late for any film have be on deeply conflict depress narrative and while this film be strike with have some of the most depressing scene the year have see so far it never wallow in the sadness it throw the moment at you and then quickly move on and as say previously the tonal shift work excellently in up favour but of course an animated movie can not work without its animation while up be not breakthrough in the way other pixar film have be it keep with the tradition of still look stun and lead the curve for computer animate film it do look cartoony and fantastical in many instance but this only continue to work towards it be even well the locale be realistic look the dog fur be near perfect for me watch carl facial hair gradually grow in as the story move along be simply amaze the little detail and minute perfection have always be key to the pixar film and up be no different additionally the 3d effect really add layer to the film and bring the movie to life unlike other recent effort like monster vs alien and bolt can not praise up enough word can not do justice for how excellent the film be pixar continue to outdo itself year after year even with their subpar film while each film have their own flaw up revel in be as close to perfect as the company have be in year adore every minute and look forward to watch it again with an even big smile on my face 10 10
a documentary more than anything else if we re go to talk about hyper realistic film make let forget about the like of peter watkin mike leigh ken loach etc and talk about frizt lang m keep forget this be feature film and consciously think be watch 1931 german documentary feature serial child killer seriously do all throughout the running time we cut to concerned parent policeman who have no lead and criminal who be fall over themselves want the child killer to be catch and it should be point out that this be where the realism lie the criminal have ulterior motif because the police search mean the gang can operate their ware due to the heavy police presence something similar happen during the trouble in northern ireland in the 1970s and 80s when loyalist terror group find they couldn operate extortion racket and robbery and drug dealing because their more extreme death squad carry out secterian murder attract too much attention from the ruc so they eliminate them be very wary of criminal who take the moral high ground because there no honour amongst thief peter lorre as han beckert doesn appear in the movie until well after the halfway mark of the running time though his sicken shadow do hang over the film throughout it by no bad thing lorre appearance be hold back because after later emigrate to hollywood the illusion be somewhat shattered when he finally do appear on screen and you only then realise you re watch feature film and not fly on the wall documentary but as say lorre bone chill performance hang over the entire film and han beckert be one of the most disgustingly memorable villain from 20th century cinema if have problem watching today it have nothing to do with the way it be originally make it all to do with the modern day presentation where there no black background to the subtitle which mean it very difficult to read the white letter on the faded film print hope to see someone to fully restore version where someone have take the time and trouble to make the caption subtitle easy to read
parent review good for old kid and adult bad for young fan car 2 be jar sequel to car while the first be very sweet movie that charm viewer of all age with its fish out of water story that explore the value of true friendship the sequel be an espionage movie with nod to james bond the man who know too much etc it full of gun bombs explosion fight etc the plot be very complicated and involve an environmental message about alternative fuel many car be kill it be terrific movie for my 11 year old son who love it but it really scar my 4 year old son whose favourite movie be car the script and visuals be clever as always up to pixar standard but this film intend audience do not seem to include car young fan be slightly disappoint on behalf of the many young kid at our screen who idolize these character the film be more in line with the action and violence of the incredibles which love but will not be show my young until he be old parent be warn probably more appropriate for 8 or 9 yr old child and up final note the toy story short at the beginning be delightful hope they don mess up monster inc next year
this be so so so american for the action part it work lot of shoot fight blow thing up and actually refresh see the white house as set in action movie last time saw that be in independence day and there it be just blow to piece it do take heavy fire and damage in this one as well but it work very well and actually seem new and refreshing to see the bunker under neath and the hidden way in the wall etc the story seem bit unrealistic how could it really get to this but in the scheme of thing it work out like mike ban play by gerard butler but actually the rest of the actor be nothing more then fill up empty space in the story the do good job and get the story to stick together but it be mike banning goto attitude and fighting and shooting and just be bad as that be the best part the two hour fly by very rapidly there be lot of action and fighting etc and it be entertain
movie doesn know what it want to be how this movie have score of 7 on imdb be obviously the result of number of producer from the film give it the high score possible in lame attempt to market this piece of crap this be tactic use all to much on this site felt obligate to give this movie true review so anyone who be think of waste there money on this could get an honest overview firstly any movie that contain an ex wrestler be go to be crap honestly name me one with the exception of john carpenter them plus it market itself as fast paced action movie although any of the action scene if you can call them that consist of the rock just drive from one target to the next then shoot them in the head about halfway through the movie try to turn into some kind of mystery but for movie of this typical hollywood action cheese the so called twist be so incredibly predictable that it fail on that account as well there be also an absolutely ludicrous sub plot involve some sort of computer whizz hit man who like to challenge himself idd have to give this movie rating of 4 however ill give it 1 on imdb to try and lower its overall score of 7 as much as possible this be movie make buy spud for spud steer clear
ignore the over sensitive reviewer ignore the over hype praise this be good film but that about it if you be to read the review here you ll see that people say it the great film ever or one of the bad most disgusting thing ever that test the limit of free expression and be candidate for censorship it neither without spoil the film the story go for too long it a 2 hour film which be not very long for myself but it felt very long and just want it to end lot of the action be pointless there be some action scene that advance the plot but lot of the action just exist to give us sense of how terrible this place be once the initial message be make we get it loud and clear the film continue to bludgeon us with the message over and over m not sensitive or easily offend ve see documentary about place like this but lot of time be waste build this world where it could be easily do in the background rather than the foreground the story be bit thin there be multiple mini plot but the grand narrative be not really there the music and cinematography be interest sort of 90 mtv music video pop up interpretation of slum but it doesn get bonus point for that nor minus point for the not take the subject matter seriously which some commenters complain about the presentation style chronology be strange and feels little half bake it deal with multiple narrative but they lack common start point when you meet character we re give quick biographical montage highlight reel to get us up to speed this be do few time which take you out of the film like the film but only just and wouldn want to watch it again would not really recommend it to anyone
messy movie with some fun moment this movie be clearly write by someone who be not use to write movie which of course be disastrous when make fantasy flick nothing serf creative fantasy story well than tight well execute plot mean look at star war what be talk about let me illustrate my opinion with some point the mystery villain the one that destroy everything clearly doesn work if the audience have no clue what it could possibly be during the entire first act we progress no further than it some vague threat therefore there be no tension in that regard at all which make the film un engage both the beast and the magic be rush in rather quickly at which point there be nothing leave to wonder at world building be normally do more slowly allow you to ease into into the fantasy setting again this will prevent people from be engage in what happen an entire subplot about some newspaper owner and his two son go absolutely nowhere and serve no purpose then there another mystery villain white haired guy whose name be grindelwald villain whose plan and purpose be only reveal at the end of the movie again not very interesting to watch movie where the evil force be completely obscure and seem to have no impact on the plot until the very end don even understand what his plan be he keep transform into collin ferell use polyjuice potion in order to do what talk to credence the other mystery villain it seem any form would suffice for that why use the one of some senior guy at the magic ministry all he really do be monitor the kid he think would form an obscurial bad black cloud that destroy everything so he could harness its power guess then when credence get destroy in the end he give some weird lamenting speech and start fight everyone why not use that collin ferell disguise for once our protagonist be pretty bland and most of the time have no clear motivation he come to the us to release his bird even that be set up as mystery dear lord but he keep get sidetrack by all the thing happen around him this be important because there no sense of mission or task to complete hence it not very likely people will be here it come again engage the first 2 act revolve around 4 people who sort of band together however what seem such an essential story element have very little to do with the final confrontation it pretty much newt alone get involve some steep tonal shift the movie be pretty lighthearted but quickly turn very dark couple of time wizard execution kid be beat by his foster mom kid kill his foster mom kid get kill by wizard fire squad conclusion the stake be low there little to no tension and the world building be mediocre at least it lighthearted and imaginative enough to prevent people from leave the theater in bad mood also the muggle main character work pretty well and be nice addition to the harry potter universe that normally revolve mainly around wizard well ok guess it be self defense sort of mean it didn look like they have no choice they all just start machine gun him down at one point

surprisingly good romantic drama normally do not like sappy romantic movie typically don really enjoy nicholas sparks movie in particular with one or two exception guess ll have to add another exception now while there be nothing particularly groundbreaking about this movie and there be few clichés spend the first 10 minute count every time character be portray back lit by the sun lose count end up be surprise with the subtlety of the story tell every time expect for instance the small town cop abusive ex to arrest logan for trump up charge beat him when everyone be look and then deny it beat up his ex wife when she defy challenge him or any number of movie tropes the story take more subtle route he be portray as the bad guy so to speak but not in one dimensional manner and every time expect the love interest to rip each other clothes off at the first opportunity fall head over heel for each other in melodramatic saccharine fashion and over explain every scene at every give opportunity they surprisingly didn instead the love interest be portray as gradually fall for each other over period of time in regular reasonable manner especially appreciate that dialogue be use sparingly and everything wasn talk to death like lot of movie these day if you re look for witty fast pace sex fill movie with lot of dialogue and plenty of action this definitely isn the movie for you but thoroughly enjoy the refresh change of pace the sweet gentle love story as well as surprisingly decent performance by zac efron my main gripe be that there be entirely too many back lit scene wish could have the sun follow me around all the time back light my profile overall though recommend it will probably watch again
very disappointing critic love this film and it win major award so be expect it to be very entertaining be very disappointed at how slow and dull it be it far too long for the small amount of actual material in it the character be dull and there be lot of scene that be just boring conversation kim basinger play call girl so she should certainly have at least one good sex scene however we don even see her nude let alone have sex we don see the murder that at the centre of the plot we only see the corps afterwards and people talk about it that mean that we don know exactly what happen
straight face psychobabble strain and humorless especially in light of its rather dubious psychology but well paced and comfortably lurid this genteel body count movie highlight the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as young woman periodically possess by jack the ripper thus allow for some nasty gore effect amidst the edwardian propriety it all pretty standard stuff for hammer but be handle with good deal of visual elan even if the central relationship between psychoanalyst porter and rees drive the narrative without ever be satisfactorily explain
a stupid movie with the most ridiculous plot no way this be not my cup of tea it doesn get much bad than this just the idea be really stupid smoke weed get smarter and so on perhaps this movie could be little bit entertain if you have bad hang over my point be that this movie doesn require any brain activity at all ll give it 2 10
predictable there only so many way we can put twist on christmas movie the art style feel very inspire by its predecessor however unlike classic like the nightmare before christmas and krysar every villager be flat and one dimensional in their motivation have to gag at the one female character be use as just romantic interest at the end as though the main character have earn her would platonic friendship be not consider happy end would suggest tokyo godfather or arthur christmas if you want refresh take on christmas animation
not nearly as bad as expect adult can stand it kid will love it aykroyd be perfect choice say my kid say an evil mayor want to shut down jellystone park for his personal gain ranger smith and yogi come up with plan to save the park go in be expect pretty much one of the lame movie of the year it wasn nearly as bad as expect although this be gear toward kid and be extremely predictable it do have enough funny part in it to keep adult entertain an 80 min run time help much like garfield the voice of yogi aykroyd be strange choice at first but after hear it you can think of anyone else do the voice as much as don want to say it timberlake as the voice of boo boo be actually really good choice too adult will be able to stand most of it kid will love it say my kid say would watch again wouldn my kid do
home with dark past saw home be fond of horror regardless of budget even if not my favourite genre and be intrigue by the idea which be reasonably different when it come to recent viewing of horror be behind on my film watching and review with long to watch and review list that keep get longer it take me while to get round to watching and review it give home fair chance with be interest and apprehension it turn out to be far good than expect won say that home be great film because it isn and the potential while not waste be not fully live up to consider the large number of film see recently be mediocre and less and waste potential be expect bad and be relieve that while want in fair few area it be actually one of my good recent low budget viewing start with the positive generally the production value could have be much bad there be real sense of eeriness foreboding and decently stylish atmosphere and it make the most of the confine and at time effectively claustrophobic set the music be also suitably haunt and manages to not be too intrusive likewise with the sound not be too obvious bugbear of mine with low budget viewing recently there be tension suspense and genuine creepiness the acting be good than average with the three lead carry the film pretty decently would have like however more tension and suspense and for some of the scare to be more creative and less try too hard to the point of cheesiness the dialogue be cheesy and awkward generally find that the story could have be execute well too too many part be uneventful the narrative structure be not always coherent and it can feel pad not to mention an end that perplexes in its anti climactic and muddled convolution there be exception to the good than expect production value the effect be shoddy and the editing could have be tight overall good than expect but didn blow me away 5 10 bethany cox
visually stun but also ponderous plodding and dull can remember the last time watch such thoroughly stun visual treat on big screen think this be possibly the most authentic realisation of graphic novel ve see each scene be frame like panel in comic and the viewer be allow ample time to drink in the superb visual construction of the piece sadly the time this take make for movie far too long with not enough actually happen to be enjoy the main plot line be fairly thin and be stretch to the point that actually forget about it half way through the dialogue rorschach aside lack sparkle as do the performance again rorschach aside jackie earle haley be to be commend for his performance whilst the extensive flashback use throughout only serve to disrupt the narrative flow and make for an often confusing view experience there enough here to make me want to revisit the book but doubt it will make it to the dvd collection it a shame because really want to like this but unfortunately be so bore by the end of it that just want to leave how disappointing
chikaboom chikaboom boom boom boom great movie amazing performance and act the amazing soundtrack
east german musical that be interest but not satisfy finally decide to watch this movie because be highly interested in east german cinema by defa most of the gdr best know movie be usually set during wwii or its after effect with heavy communist leaning have not have time to watch several red western that own but dramas such as jacob the liar and naked among wolf be quite masterfully do so be eager to watch something different from the good ol east german studio hot summer just seem so strange teenage musical come from communist country one not completely know for be fun in any way and be surprise with this movie of what have read no haven see the documentary note in other review the lead actor in this movie have make several of these beach musical all of which be popular but ban from distribution by the state guess the authority finally decide to produce musical and the restriction be noticeable within the movie the law student need to remind the other teen about what be illegal the co ops reign supreme the equality between woman and men with no outward sex or strong form of affection the movie have to do with group of boy and girl go to the baltic for summer break not quite the cote azur musical number fill and add to the narrative which include the story of boy crazy girl britt who be be fight over by two of the boy other potential relationship be play down or miss after all you need to be control mentally and physically in such country so one can only present so much as not to be totally censor for go across the ideologic line the movie be set amongst agricultural cooperative and fishing community of course the music be quite good the album be huge seller in the gdr the choreography be also excellent the problem arise from the disjoint story which be not quite timed right or tell clearly there be barely any real story have to replay several part to understand what be happen for example the movie quickly change from song and dance musical about boy versus girl to heavy drama the mood change so quickly didn have chance to truly enjoy the precede number after the movie end realize that want more but alas be watch it through western eye and have to remind myself it be make in east germany overall the movie be more of novelty one from the era of heavy hand government who attempt to make movie that be far from reality but maintain ideological standard after all the gdr be not wonderful utopia movie need to conform to ideology and individual auteur identity be greatly squelch here the actor and actress be quite attractive but the audience need those type much like the ussr need socialist realist figure in order to show that we aren all that bad historically it be fascinate movie to me the best number be the song that really put down britt after she be find to be play the boy for sucker all along one mention it be unfair to compare this movie to grease and the avalon funicello movie be way to comical and slapstick this be different movie that owe lot to those type of movie though don be suckered by the cover not horrible movie by far but not one of the great from the gdr the problem be mainly because of censorship and agenda which restrict personal input and freedom of expression it be for student of cinema and perhaps theatre people look for idea through the movie great music and dance number but not for this casual viewer the casual viewer would probably want their life back 6 of 10 for story 9 of 10 for music and choreography
utter failure m shock at how immensely popular this film be so far m use to find fault with overwhelmingly popular film for instance think american beauty be good but far far over rat but this be something new for me this be film that be overwhelmingly adored which find to be not only over rat but not even any good at all this be bad movie plain and simple its got really bad script the character be terribly thin with one exception gandalf and certain event have be so hurried that either they lack all dramatic force the council of elrond or they be utterly impenetrable to someone who doesn already know what happen lothlorien realize that jackson have the near impossible task of condense the fellowship of the ring into mere three hour think four be necessary at an absolute minimum but the decision he make what he omit what he condense and what he lengthen reveal his intention to make an epic action film rather than an epic fantasy adventure film even the flaw of this movie be entirely in keep with that goal action movie don need good character they need good special effect action movie don need drama they need fight there be very small minority of filmgoers who feel that action be boring as long as the character be fight they be not in any way advance the story and for story to be good it have to move there be plenty of movement in the fellowship of the ring but there be also massive sequence where the story advance not one jot for unendurable stretch of time to allow the character or their obviously computer generate counterpart to battle some massive computer generate foe the bad offender be the moria sequence which be at least twice as long as it ought to have be to those of you who say that this be the best movie ever make must strenuously disagree it not the best movie ve see this year much less ever nor be it the best movie ve see this month or even this week this movie be bad and love the book draw
tolkien will haunt peter jackson if you haven read the hobbit and or if you like the first two movie envy you of sort if someone have tell me some year ago that would consider walk out from tolkien movie opening night would have slap them with cod or salmon the hobbit trilogy be crap it little more than long list of invented battle and love story to attract wide possible audience as well as load of idiotic storyline to make the story slide into the lord of the ring movie as smooth as an elven as understand that some adaption be require from book to screen but when deal with book more or less only surpass by the bible and the ikea catalogue one should tread carefully do yourself favor read the book let your mind be the big screen
hollywood cheese the once great ridley scott continue to disappoint in film for matt damon enthusiast who enjoy crowd please silly dialogue gooey touch moment with accompany music that help you know when you re suppose to feel something bring him home eh seem like lot of work m sure in reality nasa wouldn bother and neither should you
ever get the feeling you re be cheat some reviewer have criticize this movie for not be truthful record of the life and time of the sex pistols they be miss the point this be malcolm mclaren fictionalize version of event right from the start mclaren make it obvious that this be not real malcolm know that you the audience be smarter than the medium include this film you the audience know what situationism mean you the audience know this be swindle be this good film be it worth watch if you love the sex pistol and their music yes their talent and flaw be reveal for all to see sid wear swastika truly disgust but watch him swagger along the street of paris and compare him with other so call rock star be he stupid thug probably but this be someone who bow down before abba in an airport he wasn all bad steve and paul playing on beach in brazil with convicted robber and an actor pretending to be nazi cringe worthy but listen to this pair play the intro to pretty vacant and you be listen to rock history glen matlock airbrush out of the picture completely it like tell the story of the rolling stone without mention brian jones but watch the cartoon at the end and see who johnny kick off the boat as for johnny rotten that laser beam stare and sneer say be not puppet and never will be if you want accuracy watch the never mind the llocks episode of classic album if you want swindle and we don care watch this
any second now ll be blow away maybe not well then what do we have here modern horror film place in the 70 80s era already like ti west think with most horror film today be god damn awful it refresh to see one which pay homage to the classic while try to be unique from start to finish the film be litter with classic horror reference the opening title design the babysitter satanism even some part of the music score be identical to the famous halloween score now then this film be very slow it take it time to build up in fact it take the main character 30 minute to reach the house thank god then that samatha be likable now it doesn matter how slow film start mean the shining be regard as slow but there one big contrast between the film build up one go somewhere the other doesn once we finally get to the house we do nothing more than watch samatha stroll around for the rest of the film west atmosphere be perfect his camera work be great the suspension be brilliant but nothing ever come from these very few moment the suspense just keep building west keep on add more fuel onto the fire until finally he run out and the credit start roll very little happens and when we do reach the final act it end up be boring and forgettable this film look great but sadly the script be poor leave potential film into easily forgettable one if you particularly enjoy watch people do nothing for hour and 10 minute then this be highly recommended
get sweep off your foot with dazzle masterpiece of cinema there be so much to say about this movie musical even without give anything away just look at my after note it already load with comment and detail tell me this be go to be large than normal post possibly exceed the imdb word count of thousand let see damien chazelle do it again firstly where he bash my head in with drumstick or two with 2014 whiplash which be so intense it have me sweat in the cinema twice have to watch it again the very next day and wasn any less sweaty the second time round an absolute masterpiece chazelle again display his absolutely stunning visual brilliance whilst tilt the hat to classic cinema and musical like casablanca funny face and the red balloon have be to a countless of time find it to be my less favourite of the american city ve be to but chazelle manages to add glossy vibrant veil over the top that inspire me with new appreciation for the city still find it incredible and slightly unbelievable but in good way that he manage to take modern bustling and dirty city and still make it feel retro and vintage use abstract cinematography like create its very own time zone altogether he even open use the original 20th century fox logo and the fade out focus make you feel like you re watch theatre play there a long list of scene that stay with you because of this style and of course be musical chazelle honour the classic musical method with astonishing and exuberant long take that make your smile stretch from seat 1 to 20 the opening scene alone be tremendous feat with epic cinematography and beautiful imagery could dissect the whole movie recount each joyful and pleasant scene by scene but it truly something that have to be marvel at by see and not read the story be about turbulent romance between seb ryan gosling confident proud and passionate pianist those ambition sit with have his very own jazz club and mia emma stone struggle aspire actress try to make her way in the superficial hollywood the car they drive be sweet analogy of their character in way seb drive classic 82 buick riviera and mia driving prius it must be familiar ground for both play aspire perform artist such as they be in real life apparently the auditioning scene which be torturous be draw from both star actually experience in audition the chemistry between the two be as always perfect this be their third outing after gangster squad and stupid crazy love gosling ooze certain coolness but with quite the finazz of confident arrogance whilst stone appear vulnerable reserve and bashful but what simmering be an audacious creative and inspire woman it so well balanced and enrich by both you could be forgive for forget john legend be in the movie chazelle and hurwitz love of jazz shine through just like it do with whiplash now know keep reference whiplash but please note these be two very different film which make this all the more impressive it the similarity such as the music be very much subject matter to both film m no expert but m lover of jazz too and this soundtrack itself be utterly amazing infectious and make the heart glow with instantly recognisable track like someone in the crowd city of star and lovely night justin hurwitz compose mesmerise enchant musical that remind me of sit in ronnie scott and have me weave in and out of traffic whilst listen to the song in the car gosling and stone perform the song and dance excellently display gracefulness that would make any non musical fan lover and dancer the choreography be majestic throughout especially the two scene at griffin park observatory the tap dancing in particular gosling actually learn to play the piano for his part entirely say lot about him as star and as an actor get the emotion to come through the whole production be flawless and as ve say before this zesty imagery be make up dazzling costume design great atmospheric set and masterful use of light the dress mia wear set against the plot she on be just eye candy and seb shoe want pair of those shoe have you ever watch film and think it be personally message to you send from the cosmos whether it be dig or reminder the conclusion certainly hit few chord on my heartstrings bring tear to my eye it the perfect end to glorious movie it only shame be not have enough song and dance but it good thing to leave want more and the film already have runtime of 128mins as always haven read any review but from what can gather from the quotable taglines they be award the film with they re absolutely right it really be what everyone be say dazzle delightful masterpiece that amazingly good for the soul heartfelt and prefect blend of modern and vintage style be nominate for 14 oscar 11 bafta award and win 7 golden globe should speak volume be totally swept off my foot and urge everyone to watch this film at least twice run time 9 the cast 10 performance 9 direction 10 story 10 script 10 creativity 10 soundtrack 10 job description 10 the extra bonus point 10 98 9 10
get carter be certainly an icon of british miserablism however my most recent rewatching leave me unimpressed love british film of the 60 and 70s everything very grey and very brown and the character be thoroughly downbeat and pessimistic there also vile pattern wallpaper everywhere the visceral kitchen sink drama be british trademark that can still be find in later film such as gary oldman nil by mouth 1997 and paddy considine tyrannosaur 2011 get carter be an icon of british miserablism first saw the film on tv when be quite young like it ve have it on dvd for year and always regard it as nasty hard hitting classic however after watch it again in 2013 be leave rather deflate there no doubt that it continue to be drab and nasty the abject horror of 60s architecture can be see throughout the film think the brutalist architect of the 50s and 60s do more damage to our landscape than the luftwaffe carter really corroborate the say it grim up north as the film great climax show that even the beach can escape the polluted achromatic hell of the city m please to see that the beach have since be completely clean up despite this the problem at its core be simply age it have date badly the violence have no punch quite literally the choreography of caine beat down on various enemy be unconvincing and in some instance just risible the bad example of this be when carter manage to catch someone fist and slap him round the face in scene that be horrendously edit there also another moment where he lunge towards woman who can not act in café and wrap his hand around her throat in highly orchestrate fashion all of this amateurism be exacerbate by how in this film at least michael caine be not an intimidating figure in the long good friday 1980 bob hoskins be short stocky and have very bad temper however caine whilst cool and moody be rather lanky and weak the script be also date it all bloody this and you re git that while there no doubt that the british have an affinity for such word it felt like the script be under the gaze of mary whitehouse well someone more lenient actually the ridiculous whitehouse would even object to the lexicon of get carter aside from its age also find the story weak it be basic which can be great however as the character and their relationship be so unremarkable carter straightforward revenge narrative suffers didn particularly care for carter and his cause he a blandly nasty character meting out justice to other equally flat character caine be fine as jack carter he have moment of great anger especially in an emotional outpour in the film final minute outside of these moment however be rather standard hard man stock character performance while get carter be still bleak and perhaps capture the zeitgeist of 70s work class britain it be rather dramatically unaffecting after year of think it be great film be leave unimpressed by its lack of character development its collection of poor support performance and its dated action and script the shock climax on that foul pollute beach and roy budd fantastic score be still high point though
didn feel right from the get go hearing that simpson movie be about to release got me excite altho didn think the simpson would be as gold if it be on tv be somewhat correct if you ve watched simpson for as long as me you should understand it be quite funny but the plot in the movie be something way to out of the ordinary something that would be do on regular simpson episode the movie seem more inclined to focus on the conflict rather that the character to me it be as funny as think it could have be and be somewhat of disappointment for me think matt groening and his writing team could have do lot well it doesn even seem like his material

10 10 comedy 4 10 action 1 10 intelligence let give this movie some credit morgan freeman could make pluto nash look like good movie if he want his presence contribute something it be shame that his character however do not the villain be cool the gun fight be cool the hand to hand combat be pathetic it all amount to close up shot of the waist artfully avoid the need for choreography most combat be resolve with sock punch of some kind it be so dated it be like watch fight scene in the original star trek series only without the surrounding plot or character interaction so cool gun cool explosion and some watchable stock character here we get to the best part of the movie it be hilarious m sure people in the audience think the big american accent guy at the front of the cinema must have find all the flag wave at an obvious point that everyone know be come just to avoid spoiler quite evocative because literally have to bite my finger until the pain be overwhelm to avoid burst into laughter m laugh now just think about it by the movie end be lean forward with my eye water and my finger in my mouth my girlfriend hold onto me for moral support and when the credit finally roll lean my head back and laugh for full minute be glad watch this movie here the bad part if you re look for something with brain run run fast far and never ask patriotic american for their opinion you will be offend in every way m not slag off patriotism or america but if you re dumb enough to accept the way they do it in this movie take your 2 digit iq back to the trailer park and please please get your ilk out of hollywood while you re at it
fantastic when the credit for the movie come up and yet another great song by rage against the machine blaring in my ear just think to myself what great piece of entertainment this movie be be big fan of the first one like other million be and be eagerly await the sequel although it might not be as good as the first one in term of it shock us the way it do in 99 when it bring to us such new flavour in cinema in term of development in action special effect and its terrific story all and all it still hold up very well consider the pressure this movie have on its shoulder to live up to the great expectation think that why lot of people weren real keen on this one because it have such huge pressure and whatever the wachowski produce it wasn go to be good enough or people would say it could or should of be well believe the wachowski brother make it more epic and like most sequel you can tell that it have s load more money to work with apart from the zion scene and the twin not get enough screen time this movie be right up there and for movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fight sequence car chase and special effect in action it a special movie well do larry and andy show everyone just why we go to the movie pure escapism and entertainment
the most quotable film of all time those coen brother have an ear for language you feel it in the sing songy banality of fargo and in the noiresque machine gun dialogue of miller crossing but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ear that be the big lebowski channel the opaque mystery of raymond chandler the coens throw la resident bum and bowling aficionado jeff lebowski the dude to his friend into strange triple cross case of kidnap ransom nihilist and urinated upon rug it be the equivalent of throw unrelenting force at an immovable object the dude bemuse stoicism at constant odds with the world around him he much rather be bowl with craze vietnam vet walter john goodman and pure silent soul donnie steve buscemi as with so much of the coens output style be more than half the point not just visual though ace dp roger deakins paint an allure canvas but tonal and auditory this be an insanely funny head trip of movie with wonderfully idiosyncratic character down to the small part who well than the coens to reinvent the comedy of error this be without doubt one of their very best personal favorite an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face do yourself and see this now if you haven already
one episode give sam and bucky more development in 45 min than in 6 movie as of write this there have only be 1 episode release but feel confident in say that this show could very well be one of the best mcu project ever the sheer fact that this one episode have make sam and bucky both feel like less of the sidekick character or the cool action character we see sophisticated story line with bucky come to term with his past and sam family think this show would be carry by its action but if the other 5 eps be anything like this it will be completely character driven and purely amaze this will definitely be good than wandavision
quite possibly the bad movie ever make this movie should never have be make yuck if you like this movie you re probably twelve and female and have no sense of what art and film be or should be and probably shouldn be watch movie in the first place flat story base on even flatter subject matter don know what be bad that this film ever get make or that hollywood continue to find reason to make film about dance let just pretend that the story be good the dialog anything other than flat the direction and photography somehow original it wouldn matter dancing have to be the least compelling base subject matter for any story or film but don worry if if the whole idea of dance doesn make you want to vomit the flat act directing and dialog will assure you unless you be literally twelve year old girl or just have yet to mentally mature beyond that think you ll agree and if you be then you re opinion do not matter
dangerous and uninteresting once saw work by the german graphic artist klaus staeck there a entnazifizierungsurkunde formula of de nacification fill out for certain adolf hitler where he rat as mitlaeufer nominal member of the nazi party sign by joachim fest this poster very pointedly summarizes fest work on hitler it a real shame that such an inadequate work with such questionable moral background get rat this high in the indb just one snippet the only person of the nazi elite which really manage to commit an atrocity in the whole film be goebbels wife all the other nazi magnifico be pitiful and broken creature who have fail in great endeavor sure maybe should concentrate more on the capability of the actor the camera work and the quality of the adaption of the book which be all ok in part even superb but win a film on this subject can only be measure by the subject itself and in this respect it fail the one relevant question why be neither ask nor answer
fantastic im just gon na start off by say love this movie its one of my favorite of all time honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its little long and batman by now infamous voice but everything else be top notch the act story atmosphere and action scene be all amazing if you haven see this movie see it right now go into this not expect to much but come out blow away cant imagine any movie be much good ll just have to wait for the dark knight rise to release to see if anything can be well until then this stand as the best movie ve ever see
dissapointed saw the matrix matrix reload in the big screen twice like them very much and wait for matrix revolution but now that saw the last part of the trilogy m dissapointed the peace be not go to last long people need to get out of zion and machine need power neo power be incomprehensible there be no explanation character like merrovigian percephone sati and her parent be only exist to fill up the movie the attack in zion be great
it like watch you tube video thats 2 hour too long be huge fan of zombie movie which be the only reason why this movie would land in anyone hand but listen and listen carefully this be not only the bad zombie film ve ever see it may actually qualify as the bad of any film ve see period for anyone who say this film be realistic that hard to measure if zombie stand there do nothing while simultaneous scar the crap out of everybody then yes it very very realistic but doubt that be the case they should have name it zombie matrix they way they have bullet fly around be embarrass make my girlfriend watch this
excellent movie this be great movie would recommend it to anyone the writing be excellent steer you through crazy idea and throughout the entire movie you re left wondering be it real or be he crazy you get many hint both way during the ride the movie explore the strained relationship between father and daughter and theirs be an especially broken one evan rachel wood and micheal douglas both do an outstanding job with their character and be thoroughly convince if you like low key sundance friendly movie that make you think pick this one up
really good especially if you be muslim as be write this review few minute have pass since have watch under the shadow will not exaggerate like some other people do in praise this movie by call it masterpiece it be not if this be masterpiece to you you re set the bar very low but have to admit that for horror film this thing be damn good and refresh everything about this film work very well the development of the story the taut direction and especially the pace the movie be 1h24min which be the ideal run time since no time be waste on unnecessary scene or plot line the thing like most beside the direction be the story especially the involvement of djinn since be of the muslim confession it make me glad that somebody finally explore this theme in movie basically djinn be nothing else than demon and see though have see lot of demon theme horror flick under the shadow give me genuine sense of terror which be partly due to my small familiarity with the djinn theme if you be muslim or you know thing or two about the mythology of djinn and how it affect the mind of lot of muslim you will understand how it manage to scare me and before forget to mention it the subtext in this movie regard the political and social situation in iran be very well deliver lot of the difficulty that the main character face be present to this day and it be really refresh to see movie that tackle such delicate theme without bash your head in with political statement if you be fan of the conventional hollywood horror film chance be you win enjoy it much but if you like see foreign film that swerve from convention you will probably like it
start well fails soon after where be the sutton hoo treasure the helmet for goodness sake not even mention of the world famous artefact not sure what the point be
how the mighty have fall we hop it would never happen but no one be perfect even the best can stumble this have to happen eventually even the string of terrific disney classic film and the 90s disney renaissance didn last forever m afraid that yes pixar have make bad film car 1 be their least ambitious film the story be predictable and character development obvious make it their most mediocre film it be good but it lack that little extra touch that make their film great however they have some great side character heart and wonderful scene that elevate it up beyond most other film but ever since this film announcement always wonder why mcqueen have his story and there not much else to tell like find nemo where else be there to go and d rather see sequel to good movie like the incredibles even bug life seem to have more potential it easy to see why they make sequel to it since all you need to do be go to disneyland or any disney store and see it cover in mcqueen and mater which happen to be two my of three year old cousin first word off all the pixar film car make the most with the merchandise the big problem be the story car 1 while predictable be touch car 2 have almost no heart or character development the focus shift from mcqueen to mater mcqueen have his story in the first and there little to tell here he have one character moment that essentially the same realization as the first film the problem with mater be that he such simple character everything about him be on the surface for all to see he the same person throughout the movie with one predictable realization which go no where that he doesn warrant his own film he like kronk from the emperor new groove they re both terrific side character but lack enough complexity for full story and larry the cable guy have always be well with the other blue collar guy rather than on his own while car 1 highlight be its side character this movie almost abandon them they do nothing mcmissile be move plot device and little more shiftwell be suppose to be love interest but lack any interesting moment the rest of radiator spring basically sit back while mcqueen and mater have all the fun their story and character be push aside so larry can have fun be mater because of this there be almost no funny little side scene where character just have fun be themselves instead most of the humor be derive from see mater do silly thing the look be impressive but not more than anything else pixar do with each movie the studio have push the graphic into new level each movie have have some wow moment where audience can help but be amaze by what they re see there be time in car 1 when it look almost real car 2 lack any wow factor one of the most impressive set tokyo be already spoil by the tokyo mater short this more than anything make me wonder if pixar be even try to up the ante or if they be just use what they have to make movie year spy and car seem to work well together after all any bond or bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together indeed the opening scene on the drilling platform be easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadget but they weren able to properly combine the racing and spy element almost as if you re watch two movie at once there too much spy stuff for the racing to be interest which become pointless against the overpowering and overly clichéd spy story perhaps pixar should have set it as simply spy movie set in the car universe and have mcqueen and his friend in cameo or as background story another lousy spot be the music car 1 have terrific soundtrack with excellent us of popular song like life be highway and route 66 but there not one memorable song or music cue in this movie giacchino usually do terrific work like with the incredibles ratatouille and up but he too fumble the ball here perhaps he be just uninspired by what he have to work with car be lasseter pet project but think he too close to it he get that lucas star war prequel trilogy problem the people around him either be in awe of the man who make pixar and toy story or they be afraid to hurt his feeling since he love the car franchise so much pixar effort have be so well do because they be collaborative effort each fix each other problem to make good project but with lasseter off work more directly with disney he really should have have co director or perhaps give the rein to someone else like he do with toy story 3 almost rat this movie high it be fun while you re watch it even if as soon as it over it become too easy to pick apart the problem but this be pixar they ve dominate the animation market since toy story and have be push the boundary at the academy award ever since to see them stumble with not so great film would be one thing but they re come off from two best picture nominee to movie that simply flashy but with little substance kid will love the bright color and silly antic but parent will hate have to then buy twelve new mater toy car 2 be stall and in need of tune up
a solid film to watch this film be just good fun it nonsensical funny and have some spectacular cringe worthy moment while certainly not the best movie ve watch in awhile d definitely say this be worth the watch if you ve get free night
best movie just watch this again on netflix after watch it back im 2016 when watch it for the first time hat the end today almost 3 year later end be perfect to me this movie be beautiful because the end wasn typical and it also show mia perspective of what if with beautiful score music there be several long take scene and those be just breathtaking could see all the hard work that have be put in the film in every aspect music act set color angle direct and etc it come all together to form one la la land beautiful now be off to purchase dvd
an empty and unpleasant film people say that this film be somehow amazing to me it be far more about image and very light on any content be all for the freedom to depict unpleasant act where appropriate and where it have some purpose to it but don see any point to the vast majority of this film the whole thing seem to be design to appeal to base instinct through violence and sex without ever make any valid or think provoke point about either these or any other issue realise it be in the top 250 list but personally feel this film owe more to its notoriety people think it be ban despite the fact it be actually willingly withdraw by kubrick in certain country than to any real merit in the film the character seem to me to have very little real depth and the film be just series of scene design to shock and court controversy this probably win be popular review but just don see that this film in itself justify its position in the poll
oh my god how this movie receive solid review from critic be beyond me it predictable and poorly execute the motif that sway the character decision be flimsy at best laughable in truth the end be awful the writing be poor and mundane m honestly flabbergast honestly m give it one because someone need to balance out the fact that anyone would give this 6 review
an interesting and visually compelling thriller horror with great atmosphere call me crazy but really enjoy it think the atmosphere be very well craft take lot of inspiration from david lynch twin peak check out the alternate opening on the dvd and tell me that it doesn remind you of the twin peak open credit sequence but still manage to be interesting and effectively creepy the music be also great and very angelo badalamenti ish some review categorize it as part of the torture porn sub genre but disagree think the gore wasn too gratuitous whenever there be gore it be effective it wasn overuse to the point where the audience become apathetic to it especially like the art direction and overall think it be very aesthetically please some interesting surreal imagery yes the color symbolism be overdone but what can do all those lush blue and red appeal to me also think the script be clever in its plant pay offs and in term of foreshadowing and lindsay lohan act though not brilliant be adequate and convince the directing in some of the dramatic dialogue scene could have be tight with big sense of urgency especially towards the end but will be interested to see what director chris sivertson do next
dead pool violence be this super hero movie well yes in way that deadpool can not be kill be this meant for kid no it be more violent with adult scene and nasty joke for super hero movie it more of super vengeance movie of character take from the movie good bad and ugly have the trait of all the three men be comedian and deadpool be originally human if be to give presentation of the movie it will end in three slide slide 1 introduction slide 2 romance and terminal disease slide 3 betrayal and vengeance but then presentation of this movie be very good with little content they make good movie for me movie should have more content with good presentation of course wont call this movie as bad but the expectation after see the trailer be very high in the end trailer alone be enough for this movie if you have see all the trailer then you don require to see the movie to spoil your imagination as there be nothing more impressive to it
surprisingly enjoyable while there be hundred and thousand of movie out there about fast car and hot head driver who be once scorn and then get out for revenge this movie oh wait actually this be another one of those still pick to watch it simply because who doesn like fast car and hot guy in that order please do note be female at this point be also huge fan of nfs video game so decide not to miss the movie even though be not expect much that say you will not find an amazing or puzzle plot it be pretty much linear and very predictable the character be also not that well develop and do not tend to stick in your mind long after movie all in all it give you nothing of value except two good hour of great visuals beautiful car you can only ogle at in movie or game amazing action sequence and some pretty nasty car stunt though sadly not too much of those still do find myself enjoy those few hour quite lot despite the plot full of hole and the totally needless sappy romance throw in for good measure so if you can turn blind eye to the lack of plot and be fan of nfs sleek car street race and crazy velocity you will find this movie pretty satisfy if not well it will most probably be the long two hour of your life
best movie ever the dark knight be the best movie have ever see in my life
her what who that girl it rare award film 10 10 star even for many film truly love equally it uncommon for me to give movie just one star out of ten but here we be literally just watch this take nap and barely remember single thing about it except well didn like it at all and if have gun to my head wouldn be able to give synopsis that be not good sign so hence the 1 star bah
why give it one star spielberg have only one goal in his twilight year to change his reputation from master story teller to master partisan hack how about you make story which tell the truth about the contemporary press it a statist institution who have only one goal to scrap the constitution in favor of an anti american leftist utopianarchist political agenda
bore drab and too long at first it be hard to believe this film be two hour and forty minute long it felt more like an eternity the whole first two hour be nothing more that flashback after flashback by the time the film reach it so call climax you really don care about the character any long for cry out loud half the actor look bored just make it too many subplots most of which come out of nowhere and go no far the only people could suggest watch this movie would be the fan of the original graphic novel maybe those people will actually have clue what be go on as for the direct m not go to comment don know what the film be even suppose to be about so m not sure if zack snyder succeed in pull off the original context as it be he didn do it for those of us that never read the material in summary the character be two dimensional the plot be dizzily boring and confuse at the same time and by the time you get to the end you don even care if nuclear war happens or not be root for merely to destroy the miserable excuse for nixon just my two cent your opinion might differ fuzzy
reminds me to snowpiercer from bong joon ho be give it solid 7 good movie remind me to snowpiercer from bong joon ho but in this case the prision be vertical and not horizontal train but challenge the human behavior in similar way good movie

sas scene join this site specifically to comment on the scene in this film which show sas soldier act like raw recruit when confront by sniper whereas us bomb detonation squad dealt with the situation as if they themselves be elite force how movie contain ridiculously conceive scene like this can win any oscar be beyond me would bomb detonation squad in the us have sniper masquerading as bomb disposal squad member also why do they take all day watch the insurgent hideout can you imagine this happening in world war 2 for example the war would have be lose if the ally have approach every battleground with this kind of nonsensical caution there be many other questionable scene in this film and don understand how anybody with modicum of intelligence would vote for it to receive any sort of prestigious award

one of the bad movie have see this film be an unfortunate waste of time and money as an english teacher that teach the classic include the count of monte cristo be amaze to find few similarity between the novel and this film and these similarity be questionable at best the vengeful plot of the count be beautifully woven romanticize psychological thriller after dante be wrongfully imprison on the château if he plan to take vengeance on the men who be responsible for destroy his life these men be danglars villefort and fernand who be not friend of dante but the man who take away his love because of these men dantes lose everything that be dear to him include the woman he love mercedes who be not pregnant by dante and who wait 18 month before she marry her cousin it be from the pressure of prison that dantes carefully calculate the method he would use to get his revenge he want it to be slow and painful suffering because quick death be too good for these men none of this tension be evident in the film the film bastardize novel that be full of tension and suspense which keep reader want to find out what happen next this be hollywoods way of chase the almighty buck this film do little to make me or my student want to watch it my junior and senior who be not always focus on reading be thoroughly engage in the novel because of dumas masterful write several student have see the film and have make the same comment have make this be film for people who have never read the book so stay out of the video store save your money grab the book out of the library sit down and let alexandre duma take you on thrill adventure that will keep you turn the page
not my cup of tea after watch the entire box set of break bad recently this film be punt for me unlike bb character development appear rush and skittish understand there be fandom of the actor from bb but this excuse of film be just lame the vagueness of the protagonist back story didn help me click into the movie at all instead it leave me with thought of how hard it must be for bob odenkirk to shake off the character of saul in bb if someone else have play hutch maybe it would be slightly more believable but alas we ll never know in all though it not great story and relies too heavily on hutch incredible combat skill and the extraordinary incompetence of the antagonist and his associate hence the low score
absolutely terrible love long and epps but this be gd awful make for lmn
some cool visuals but lack in depth just watch this on pay per view have miss chance to see in theater dither over whether or not to see it due to wildly mixed review it be visually engage enough to keep me watch till the end but as the credit begin to roll find myself feel dissatisfy some of the scenery and shot feature animal be really cool find myself wish for more that be more time spend on animal and close look at different specie as imagine by the creator of this film ray winstone be distinguish actor but find his portrayal at time creepy at time laughable overall weak how much of this be due to direction and or other factor not sure when it come to this film didn get sense either way emma watson and jennifer connelly impress me get sense of quiet strength from their character russell crowe also one of my favorite actor think his robin hood be masterful fresh new take disappoint without give anything away there be some part of this film that call for more dramatic narrative his timing and at time rushed speech take away from the grandeur of what be mean to be an epic film you find yourself wish he would deliver certain line bit more theatrically like david wenham in 300 or one of the great of classic film charlton heston perhaps didn realize when start watch that anthony hopkins be also in the film when he pop up on screen laugh and think of course can make an epic film without anthony hopkins probably just me but it seem bit tired as far as casting go might have enjoy it more on the big screen but don regret watching at home on my tv bottom line entertain enough to watch just bit of let down
i love movie musical but hat this be sooo excite for this to movie to finally hit netflix and even pause the movie after the opening number just to tell my boyfriend that be sure be go to love it maybe my expectation be set too high but overall the movie be huge disappointment the dancing be very stiff which first think be endear and part of their character until notice there be no positive progression the sebastian storyline with jazz reference be not so much offensive at least not to me but just not believable the musical number didn add much to the storyline didn get invest into the character background or development the only thing like be that the story seem to be about young lover let each other go in order to fulfill their individual dream but that could have be portray well m honestly not sure why his movie be rat this high except for one catchy song
i want those 2 hour of my life back this be one of the bad movie that ve see in year like action movie and usually have no problem with mindless plot and violence but this movie make steven seagal movie look oscar worthy the actor be fine and there be plenty of funny one liners the plot be nothing special but can accept that the problem be that the movie be carry out with such lack of cohesion that everything just fell to crap just do not give damn what happen in the movie after the first 30 minute and to tell the truth just want it to end my advice be to save your money and more importantly to save your time remember this be your life and you can never get those hour back
too realistic to arise some interest have just watch the film and have the impression that this film do not deserve to be in the top 250 movie think it be good and realistic portrait of adolf hitler last day and all the madness that surround him utterly disagree with those who say this film give pro nazi vision have pay much attention more than two hour and haven find the slight sign of nazi propaganda in this film but be willing to watch film and what find be documentary and be not happy with that the film didn arise my interest at most point why mainly because it be too long it more of documentary than film and doesn add any interesting special feature to make it more interesting particularly don feel any suspense during the film what be try to say be that when you be do film about something people already know most people know lot about hitler and particularly that he commit suicide you have to add something to the film to make it interest or to add your personal view to an historical event and none of these thing have be do in the present film therefore see this film more as boring documentary than as film
now you see me but wish hadn i remember see the trailer for this and think it really look great read some of the review on here many of them claim that people with low iq dislike the film well don mean to toot my own horn but don think m stupid individual and ve see thousand of movie more than your average joe because love movie however this be stone cold dud decent cast some real twist and turn but blatantly complicate plot line that make little sense and try way too hard just to be complex truly smart film can be smart and tricky without try so hard now you see me just throw in all kind of trick and twist without any build up or think about whether or not it make sense it be very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie be reveal and everyone in the theatre be in gasped and then that be immediately follow by many people whisper that dumb that doesn make sense they be exactly right the big twist have no groundwork laid for it and make no sense at all but by that time you be so completely lose in the silly story that you win care that it doesn make sense the cast certainly be not the issue for this film the cast be actually pretty good m just surprise they actually sign on to this but then again it be make okay money at the box office didn much care for jesse eisenberg character that not to say he didn do good job just didn like him much his character be smug and egotistical but fit the role nicely and carry the cast well think woody harrelson be excellent in his role as mentalist that can hypnotize he be probably my favourite character and yet there wasn a lot do with him which be unfortunate isla fisher and dave franco lump together because while they be good they be mostly underused and sort of the sidekick to eisenberg and harrelson most of the time think if be make film like this would ensure the four of them share an equal amount of screen time and have strong character but they do well mark ruffalo be the fbi agent try to get to the bottom of the group of thief ruffalo be good show lot of intensity and the appropriate amount of angst for cop v robber unfortunately for her thought mélanie laurent be very near pointless suppose she be there to give the audience yet another possible suspect and also to give ruffalo romance but both those angle be completely unnecessary and her monotone line delivery be enough to put you to sleep finally we have two legend morgan freeman and michael caine the best scene in this movie easily be the one with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma be enough to carry any scene however they be definitely blatantly use for their name power and the weak script do nothing for them give director louis leterrier be talented director m surprise at really how bad the film be shoot be there some nicely shot scene yes there be but few and far between have actually see all of leterrier film and this be by far the bad of them will give prop to them in the opening scene when they play magic trick that actually work on me they pick the car that pick wonder if it work on everyone after that the film fall into complex web of lie and deceit and completely silly twist and turn that make little to no sense perhaps there be two many hand in the pot there be no less than five screenwriter and story artist on the film its hard enough to find two writer that can jive and work together let alone five basically now you see me be huge disappointment for me in summer of blockbuster you need something good than this 4 10
homage to treasure island anthony quinn star in high wind in jamaica where he and first mate james coburn preside over an unruly crew of pirate this be beautifully photograph film which have lot of problem with it a bit of homage to treasure island with captain quinn bond with several child who have be send to the united kingdom by their parent nigel davenport and isabella dean from jamaica where the parent have become colonizer it for the kid education but they get quite the education when during raid on their ship they wind up on the pirate ship in many way high wind in jamaica be disney like but there be too many grim scene for this to ever be disney type material and in the end those kid especially the old girl do not prove to be jim hawkins like see the film get lot of positive review but m afraid can be one of them
cause they multiply like rabbit those dastardly russian have come up with yet another plan to wipe out those capitalist american in the nasty rabbit they ve outfit your common every day bunny rabbit with some nasty germ in barrel like the st bernard carry schnapps while on rescue mission in the alp they ve sent russian spy outfit like cowboy and have pinpoint location for him dude ranch on the continental divide where he be to let the rabbit loose where presumably he will multiply because he a rabbit and spread the germ to human michael terr play the spy like bad imitation of mischa auer but the us government be on to those russian trick they ve sent rock and roll agent in the person of arch hall jr who look great but can act good than him of course hall also have little time for romance the rancher daughter play by liz renay even richard kiel in his pre jaw day can save this film or give you reason to watch run if you see this one advertise
surprisingly good wow it be always pleasant to go into movie with no expectation and this one deliver in spade any story start with well great story and this be it although somewhat predictable it more comforting predictable good guy win story with enough great twist in it to keep the interest the cast here lift the game who know affleck have this in him and support by the ever sweet kendrick all be it with kick as moment and throw in favorite like simmons terminator genisys and addai robinson shooter all play their respective part well the scene with affleck and kendrick character have lunch show great subtly in write directing and act lot of dry and subtle humor throughout no overdone cgi either just good clean action regularly punctuate the plot with the clean cinematography only add to clinical nature of our lead character for the run of the mill action flick you shouldn pass this one up
a work of genius show its age metropolis be troublesome film for me appreciate its vision the intricacy and prescience of its social commentary and the sheer beauty of some of its scene the robot be an icon for retro futurist design film impossible not to admire yet each time have see it four now think always find myself bore the visionary sequence be too few and the melodrama grow too heavy far too often scenes like maria flight from rotwang become overwrought at once and then drag on long enough to be comical my most recent viewing be the hollywood classic dvd with so many restored version of metropolis around the quality of this release be terribly disappointing love silent german film but each time have see metropolis come away feel it be an over rat film
a beautifully shot film that be nothing like the type of movie expect go in when saw that the empty man be go to be 137 minute long it have little reluctant to go to it the reason be that if horror movie isn good then even 90 minute runtime can be an absolute drag it a real gamble for film in that genre to be anywhere near two hour let alone well past it usually try to avoid trailer for movie before see them but on this occasion do happen to catch it it didn fill me with confidence luckily the trailer be actually little misleading and the film actually have quite different feel to it even though wouldn say love this movie by any mean it do have enough go on to keep it watchable for that runtime just the first thing have to say be that the film be beautifully shot there be number of expertly craft shot throughout the film but one track shot from map that turn into forest and then find its way down to car drive through it be truly exquisite love that the artistic touch ari aster fill his film with be start to inspire other director the second thing that occur to me be that isn really horror movie or at least not solely horror movie apparently it be base on comic series which be more like dark detective story that kind of the vibe get here and why think this be able to survive 137 minute push it isn just case of pass from character to character and watch new and inventive way for them to die in fact the film be very rarely scary say that more in the sense that it doesn actually try to be scary all that often however when it do try it rarely hit the mark either sadly if you re fan of asmr then you be likely go to have good time with this film there be lot of it in the film and it be pleasure to listen to although it can be risk to have you doze off have very middling opinion on this film neither hat it nor love it wouldn recommend people go out of their way to see it but if they be go to see it certainly wouldn dissuade them either don be too put off by the trailer be all would say it be not an accurate representation of the film
horrible this movie completely over rat don get me wrong the acting be superb but it the storyline which anger me this movie favor the american way too much mean during the duration of this movie all you be be american soldier and german it make it look as if the american be the only one fight the war my question be where be the british the canadian and the other various nation that be fight this war long before the american enter this movie storyline be completely ridiculous the american army would not spend that much time look for one private they have big and good thing to do for historical accuracy it 5 5 although the prop and costume and terminology be accurate the entrance where the soldier be scramble for safety isn american do have air support but the american pilot be so bad at math the miscalculate and hit there own men think this movie be load of american love bull and real wwii movie should cover all the perspective of every nation not just one especially not the one that come in at the last minute say this as canadian jtf2 corporal
phenomenal performance from carey mulligan and ralph fiennes there be so many really good thing about this movie such great piece of story tell the cast be excellent and all put in great performance especially lily james and ralph fiennes it not just about an archaeological dig though it about past life present life and how thing be remember in the future there be also several strand to the relationship between all invloved too include work relationship family relationship class and secret relationship don know how much of the story be fiction or fact but it be well told either way all this set with backdrop of the come second world war be lucky enough to have see the sutton hoo treasure at the british museum and have always be keenly interested in archeology so this film base on the true story of this discovery be right up my street
not bad but disappointing one of the more overrated film lately the good production shoot edit sound be all good the great the idea of follow the same boy and others for 11 year transition from age to age be beautiful the tiresome the act it be ok but nothing that grab you ellar coltrane be at his act best when he be young but gradually get more stilted this could have be due to the director more than to him the ugly the script existential drivel over and over every character be write in way that remain two dimensional especially his sister and mother ethan hawke as his father do the best job of any of them in bring some depth of life to his role
8 6 really how in the world could this get 8 6 out of 10 0 from so many people this movie be uneventful and rather depress the story of man whose life be fill with tragedy and becomes grouch do not do much for me the boy with father who be never around wow just what want my kid to see maybe miss the point of the movie that say even my kid age 10 12 think it be bore we go with 2 other kid who say it be ok but nothing special would give the visual high mark but the story be lack imo
puerile sophomoric drivel in what have to be the final spasm of the superhero genre watchman display the narrative bankruptcy and dramatic inadequacy of an uwe boll movie tire dull character in spenser gift outfit flounce around in bore plot that move along like your grandma childhood memories the dare here be that the audience will actually be bother to stay with the quasi fascist individual hero as messiah b long enough to make it to dr manhattan realization that the birth of his late squeeze the result of her mother attraction to former rapist superhero be close enough to miracle for him to give crap about the human race m off to mar
don believe the hype don be fool many critic have go on record call david fincher the curious case of benjamin button the year best film it attract ton of oscar buzz as this review be be write walk into fincher film with high expectation but be let down nothing about this movie scream best picture with recycled screenplay too many misfired metaphor and generally gimmicky confuse premise no amount of brilliant act or technology can save ben button the premise be clever primarily base on short story by scott fitzgerald the film chronicle the life of benjamin button play by brad pitt who mother dy during child birth and who father abandon him on the doorstep of an old folk home when he be bear with the appearance of an elderly man the home run by black maid name queenie take him in as son and people begin to see that he be in fact age backwards from old to young its premise that in the right hand could have be expand brilliantly to reveal poetic idea life and death but start with the screenplay series of mistake cause the film to sink people need to accept that benjamin button and forrest gump both write by the talented eric roth be fundamentally the same movie there must be at lease 30 similarity both men be southern gentleman both have miracle moment walk for the first time both spend time on boat both spend time fight war additionally both film involve female love interest who venture out of her home for several year to pursue dream while on rocky road to find herself these 2 movie be identical and the film big defender will have hard time argue against that fact but ll ignore those similarity for minute because should assess this movie as its own work and when look at that way ll say the first word that come to mind be preachy every 7 minute benjamin narrate the film give us brand new metaphor about life and how its just so un predictable there also some completely pathetic visual poetry with hummingbird whose significance in the film message m still unsure of but you wan na know what funny for all its preaching about unpredictable event benjamin button live pretty normal life he work on boat he serve in the navy in wwii he co own dance studio with his romantic interest daisy play by cate blanchett and then he operate toll booth that sound pretty average to me and find personally that benjamin button be himself more of bizarre science fiction character than human be we could all relate to the fact that he spend his whole life see his friend die off be interest but it seem repetitive and gimmicky by the middle of the movie must concede though this film have its strength technologically the make up and height adjustment make to brad pitt be astonish and the way that he look like an old man get young and young progressively be extraordinary additionally the performance include pitt and blanchett but also tilda swinton as spy wife stay in the same motel benjamin be be good although noticed cate blanchett struggle horribly with cajun accent just don get it in year fill with multiple competitive oscar contender like the dark knight frost nixon milk slumdog millionaire and changeling it be astonish to me that this be the stand out for best picture surely benjamin button technology be worthy of award buzz but little else be feel like this picture think itself to be good than it actually be why else would the structure of the story by so explicit the production so high quality the acting as whole so good don know and come oscar time we will see if any member of the academy saw what saw in the curious case of benjamin button hope they do
good but let not say it completely realistic the visuals for this movie be impressive the story line be enjoyable and it leave you appreciate your place on earth the character also provide some good laugh it be one of the good space movie however as geek know know it a movie the orbit be all wrong for some of the event to even remotely take place so if you know anything about space travel as usual suspend disbelief for the moment it at least stayed largely true to the no sound in space thing and provide some good lesson about linear and angular momentum the fact even get to bring this up mean give the film maker some serious prop wouldn go so far as some of the review where they say the movie be create whole new genre the reviewer and movie maker just never realize until now what us geeks know all along space be much more awesome and frighten if you portray it more realistically hopefully the movie also provide good reminder about how special this little rock be and how unforgivable the rest of the universe be let try and keep our planet that way at least be remind of this when leave the theater

when be the good part come have never read any comic or graphic novel yet have be able to enjoy quite few movie that be derive from them this be certainly not the case for watchman half way through be leave wondering when the good stuff would finally start come maybe you might have some pre exist attachment to the character if you have read the book but if the movie be all you have the character be one dimensional dull and unattractive the comedian be the only one love straight away but he die within 5 minute rorschach be the next best thing but doesn get enough focus to really capture my heart the way he be discard at the end make me wonder if really he be of any importance the strength of his character be too strongly dilute by the bad scene of the silk spectre ii and nite owl ii that continuously interrupt the flow silk spectre ii be horrible she seem to have no emotion whatsoever all she do be have sex with the guy without too much of pause between them the fact that the comedian be her father might have be expect to give her more depth but hardly seem to faze her instead the 5 second of poorly act sobbing follow by immediate reconciliation make it seem like it no big deal whatsoever nite owl ii be geek devoid of passion and lack backbone he the kind of classmate who name you wouldn remember after 1 year dr manhattan serve no purpose other than be the eventual deus ex machina that solve everything make the effort of all the other hero look totally stupid and pedestrian he disconnect from the world and be typically not the kind of character viewer would connect with the bad guy ozzy get hardly any background or an explanation why he both smart than everyone and able to beat up on the comedian nite owl ii rorschach and the silk spectre ii or why he can catch speed bullet the movie spend whole lot of time on flashback that take out the whole momentum of the plot yet despite all those flashback it do not manage to make me feel connect to any of the character this be the main weakness to me the song be nice individually but many time seem wrong for the scene it one of the first time the soundtrack really bother me in movie which say lot the cgi be too obvious and in some case obnoxious and overdone give no serious add value of course they be breathtaking at time but they be awful at other time be look for dark movie with corrupted moral and realistic hero who be not perfect only rorschach bring this to the movie slow motion fight scene open bone fracture and blood splatter around just make me sigh there be no factor in any of this no sin city effect no 300 adrenaline pace no dark knight madness nothing part of the reason why so many of the fight scene couldn interest me be because they occur in subplots or suddenly pop up in the main plot unexpected as movie it fail for me this say nothing about the graphic novel which might one day buy to find out what the character be really about they sacrifice momentum and continuity in the main plot to narrate partial background on too many character often time it hard to connect your audience to 1 or 2 character if you re try to make them care about 5 or 6 of them you re bind to fail especially with mediocre or bore act this be why it be probably hard task to make movie from this graphic novel
don go 143 minute film trailer of dubstep explosion and no plot the first half an hour or so be fantastic it have all the element of great sci fi high fantasy the effect of course be spectacular the actor too can really fault them either by about half way through the film you ve pretty much get your money worth though and the rest be like be hit in the face and ear repeatedly by dubstep sound effect and explosion there be no love no investment in any of the character and the failing of this film lie purely with the screenplay which could have be write well by child and the director who seem to have miss the point of sci fi fantasy completely this film have one story line no twist no characterisation no point and no pleasure factor past the first half the second half seem to go on and on and on and on never end explosion and fight love good fight don get me wrong but when you know how the film be go to end and there really isn any suspense leave but you still have to endure another 40 minute of ear splitting explosion and fist hit thing it begin to actually feel like torture be leave feeling grief for the amount of time money and creativity that so many good film industry bod put into what could have be an excellent summer block buster how could this film end up be soooooo dull lois lane be massive fail amy adam be red head for start and even though love her and think she a fabulous actor this be not the part for her lois lane be an awesome marvel character you could argue that she be as important as superman himself her part be crucial and her relationship with superman be massive part of any superman story in this the script basically explain the plot there be no actual act out of any of the story and lois lane be allow to look like helpless ditsy girl who get into dangerous situation that make no sense didn believe her character at all it wasn her act it be the script and direction at fault not to mention that she shouldn have play lois lane in the first place the sound track could have be write by robot again it have all the element of what could have be really good but then lack any feeling or emotion the whole point of the music be to embellish the story and find my self be irritate by it so so disappointed can watch john carter and avenger over and over again actually read graphic novel love marvel film in general and love most thing sci fi fantasy but this be spectacular waste of money ve look up zak snyder other film to date and really like 300 but will avoid him in the future he just doesn float my boat

ok not bad not good just ok watch the original cartoon series as kid and can say that love it when first hear that the movie be be make got hype when saw the movie think it be master piece but then get it on tape and start compare to the series and my love for the movie slowly decrease but still like it the acting be fair and the comedy ok but my main problem be loyalty to the series like for while as kid but see it many year later make me feel little awkward but still it be an ok movie they could have be little more loyal to the series but still think it be worth watch once ps compare this one to the sequel then you will know true suckage
excellent hire this one on whim remembering that have see the trailer and have be vaguely intrigue have to admit have go in with little expectation be flaw this be one of the good movie that have see in long time jim caviezel performance be slightly whiny to begin with but in the context of the whole story the reason therefore be appreciate and make his transition and growth as character that much more riveting to watch absolutely loved him as edmund dantes then the dynamic count of monte cristo and can not have imagine good choice he be definitely not bad on the eye either every scene have him look more dashing and more handsome than the one before guy pierce surprise me with performance that be totally believable his dry humour only make him more appealing very well act the entire epic though long never give you the impression that you have be sit still for age it move along swiftly and always have me grip from the action suspense and even to the humour that be evident from time to time the love story surprise me most of all instead of take on highly sexual slant as all these new film do it be understate the female lead do an admirable job of portray the wound lover who have always long for her edmund love the innocence that she manage to bring to the role really terrific actress and really beautiful one as well wonderfully script exceptionally carry out this have to be the best adaptation yet an emphatic 10
the second grinch special the second animated tv special feature dr seuss arguably most famous creation the grinch this one isn the absolute must see classic that how the grinch stole christmas be but it be decent on its own the animation be good especially by the standard of television animation at the time the voice work be solid yes boris karloff be miss but han conried be an admirable replacement find the song unimpressive certainly no standouts like in the christmas special all in all it an interesting effort that should please most seuss fan just try to go into it not expect anything on the level of the more famous grinch story
exactly what you would expect for good or bad right now take minute and think about what you would expect from movie like everest have that think in your head well that be exactly what everest be no more no le for basic plot summary everest tell the story base on real life experience of group of climber attempt to ascend to the mountain summit in 1996 the problem that year however be that there be more traffic than ever before at the base of the mountain seemingly everyone want to make that climb on single weekend as such the group lead by rob hall jason clarke beck weather josh brolin decide to team up in order to reduce traffic and increase the likelihood of success what they don count on terrific storm that whip up and threaten every single climber on the mountain first and foremost everest be very much traditional base on true story survival type of film all the typical beat character and situation you ve see in disaster movie be all present and account for not until the last 30 minute or so do it really produce anything unique or off the beaten path depend on your point of view this could raise or lower the overall star rank quite bit go into the movie not know what to expect and just by personal preference be bit disappointed in that like film that stretch storytelling boundary bite this film doesn do that mainly through no fault of its own as it be base on true story so just as long as you know that go in you ll know what you be in for besides be relatively paint by number in term of storytelling everest do enough thing right for even someone like me to still get something out of the experience the visuals be stun the acting be well do and those last 30 or so minute provide some legitimate unexpected moment and emotional material what it come down to with everest then be that your enjoyment will almost wholly be base on your expectation and what type of movie you like if you love true story and survival tale this one be for you if you like me be look for bit more dramatized plot and originality in technique you might be little disappointed again the film can only be what it can be obviously so that be why your mindset go in may just determine the star rank come out
watchman be fascinate graphic novel adaptation that deserve to be see by anybody that like their movie complex dark and absorb watchman be the long awaited graphic novel adaptation that have for long time be deem un filmable there have be many different point over the year where this movie be suppose to be make which always end up not happen but now watchman be finally here in all its glory and it probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel the story take place in an alternative 1985 with nixon begin his third term as president and the street of new york be gritty dark and violent within new york life group of costume hero that use to be love by society but be now hat by practically everybody one night depress retired hero name the comedian be murder by masked person that break into his apartment another hero name rorschach who wear mask with shift ink blot believe that someone be pick off costume hero to begin their own agenda of destruction rorschach begin investigate and hunt down the person that be responsible for the comedian death meanwhile we meet another hero who glow blue and have almost literally become god his name be dr manhattan and although he have the power to save the world he win do it because he have lose many of his human emotion the other main costume hero be night owl and silk spectre who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret life any other attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible watchman be an extremely complex graphic novel fill with lot of flaw costumed character strong plot powerful sense of style and also contain world that seem little too close to our own the movie carry every one of these element in the best way it possibly could it stay true to the novel and only change few detail the memorable character be very well portray and act as well dr manhattan the giant blue guy be play very well by billy crudup who manage to keep the character interest despite his emotionless attitude malin akerman silk spectre ii patrick wilson night owl ii and matthew goode adrian veidt be also very good in their role however the two actor that truly help add depth and real sense of anger to the film be jeffrey dean morgan as the comedian and jackie earle haley as rorschach rorschach be probably my favorite character because technically he not really hero at all he a psychopath with harmful and destructive behavior even though in way he try to do what he believe be right for the world he be fascinate character with his shape shift mask full of ink blot that mirror his personality the movie take place in 1985 and mimic what be happen back then watchmen story revolves around the threat of nuclear war and global destruction and the character mostly try to do the right thing for the world but have trouble see the point in do so this be great film that stay true to the original graphic novel while transition its style character chain of event and storyline from page to screen the best it possibly could however if you re not familiar with the source material you may find yourself confuse by this movie it not like the dark knight where everybody that go to see it know who batman and the joker be these character be not as famous as those type of household name character and may be hard for someone whose never read the novel to understand personally only read few chapter before saw the movie and think the movie be incredible always give movie prop for not take the easy way out by spoon feed everything to the audience the book as well as the movie be dare by take of the risk of be complex and make you think for change watchman be great movie and despite its long running time of 163 minute never find it bore at all watchman be fascinate graphic novel adaptation that deserve to be see by anybody that like their movie complex dark and absorbing
finally an action film about its character the rock be an action movie alright but it an action move about its character and that what save it it have strong cast and strong character and therefore the plot about militia group take alcatraz hostage and threatening to fire bomb into san francisco if they don get 100 million dollar isn what come off the best there be four central character in this film hummel be the man in charge of this hostage takeover he be highly ranked general who be do this to teach the government lesson they ve be neglect forgotten soldier who die in the gulf and nam and instead of their family be tell the truth they ve simply be mark as miss in action he be play by ed harris who do such good man tear between duty conscience and vengeance he be the best film villain since jack nicholson in the shin goodspeed be computer nerd work for the i he never be in combat situation but because of his advanced knowledge of chemical bomb they ve send him into alcatraz with group of navy seal and he have no idea how to react in war like situation play by nicolas cage his performance be believable and powerful anderson be the man in control of the navy seal on the mission to alcatraz tough as nail bind by duty he freely admit he agree with hummel reason but he say those be risk that be part of the job and hummel be wrong in his action because he take an oath to serve his country no matter what he be play by michael biehn who deliver top notch performance and one similar to his role in terminator but the most powerful character in the film be mason the only man who have ever escape from alcatraz tough cunning and full of one liner he have be cage up in maximum security prison for year it hard to say whether the viewer can trust him or not and he have many secret and much knowledge of the facility which be why he be choose to go with the seal he be play by sean connery who performance be perfectly sean connery ish but who would want it any other way this film be great and it be great character study for anyone who might be major in it or just like to watch film with good cast recommend 1 2 out of
this movie have something for everyone to hate disney have hit rock bottom with this one there so many flaw it hard to determine good start point first off the character be very unlikable there the typical straight character stereotypical black sta mysterious foreigner who be the object of aforementioned character desire and jolly fat guy who like food yes that right this movie make jolly fat guy unlikable feat once think impossible zack galifianakis alan in the hangover play the agent who train all the guinea pig although not unlikable be very boring although none of this be the actor fault they have very little to work with which bring me to my next point the script be terrible every single joke that be write fell flat on its face there be reference to well know movie like apocalypse now scarface and the untouchable but even those couldn find funny because it be as if the writer didn put them in because it work naturally but rather set out to make reference to the movie and just insert them into any place that sort of make sense there be also quite few fart joke in this movie something that disney never should have stoop to the music selection be nothing but the late top 40 hit and each seem to be use at least three time in the movie only once do find that song make sense for the situation for me the only redeeming quality be that the animation be very good and steve buscemi character who find mildly humorous also that it be lot short than most of the other movie dislike understand that m not part of the target audience but if you re plan on take your child to this movie consider this the kid in the theater only laugh once through out the entire movie would never see this movie again it be truly painful experience

battle royal light in the past couple of year hollywood have pile on the film make from best seller from harry potter to twilight it a safe bet for the movie maker cause if the book be read by million mainly teenager then it likely that people will watch the film though the hunger game be lot more serious than those two apart from say the last 2 potter book with more brutal theme if not new because the successful japanese battle royal be out first but hunger game be best seller so lion gate make the film if someone know how to make something big out of something small that lg they didn have any mega success but that why the made hg first off we can thank lion gate for find good director and placing lot of energy on find the actor and they get good script write they even pay attention to the budget let talk about the story the nation of panem consists of wealthy capitol rule twelve poor district as punishment for past rebellion each district must provide two tribute one boy and one girl between the age of 12 and 18 select by lottery the reaping every year to compete in the hunger game they must fight to the death in vast arena with the sole survivor reward with fame and wealth in district 12 when primrose everdeen be choose in her first reap her old sister katniss an expert archer volunteer to take her place peeta mellark baker son be select as the other district tribute after the two youngster find sponsor train they start the hg where there be no friendship or innocence only survival though the film doesn clear up bunch of thing m guess because of time constraint what with the hand signal they do build up cool world maybe strange communist world mixed with rome despite that sometimes you can see that they should have spend more money on this or that the set and the filming be great the atmosphere be great and the awesome music help that too the actor be believable with co star like donald sutherland lenny kravitz woody harrelson and stanley tucci and the star jennifer lawrence have already prove herself before this film in winter bone and she didn disappoint here either and be someone you can build franchise on the film can be split into two part like the first part well the whole build up of the show the actual game be maybe little jolty didn really get the there can only be one animal killer instinct feeling as their motivator and thought there would be more blood sweat and one on one fight they probably tie the director gary ross hand to tightly because unfortunately watch what rating it get be important plus if you want more blood watch battle royal or the running man all in all you can really feel that lg do everything to make something good out of book from recycle story they be pay attention to how much they could potentially make from the franchise this work through most of the film but by the end just think it be good job but it still be good to see that ya book adaptation can be do well give it 6 10 with the side note that if you want to see genius watch battle royal http www youtube com watch tg0fxmyblp8

good atmosphere production design but everything else be weak this movie be obscenely over rat it be clear that all the attention be give to the production design and overall look to the film as the script no matter the version be awful for film so rave about by nearly every critic the plot be cookie cutter and drab the pacing be well there simply isn any pace it be l w the character be completely uninteresting and the film isn deep or genuinely philosophical enough to warrant the attention it ask us to pay there be many part that be simply goofy and unintentionally funny like when rutger hauer pop his head through the wall towards the end and say something silly or when darryl hannah could have kill deckard but instead decide to back up and then do bunch of goofy gymnastics flip in order to give him time to pick up his gun and blow her gut out it be one of my best friend favorite film and it take lot out of me to hold my tongue while watch it with him
not really as beautiful or deep as some people say ok there be strong intensity in this movie which be not to be capture by the shallow and will certainly make lot of people uneasy saw some people leave the move theater after the 1 hour great have say that this be all there be you want to show how shallow our society be and how empty and dark society be underneath what they try hard to hide do it in humanly way why you would add extraterrestrial creature to show us that aren they busy enough destroy new york brooklyn or london and will smith or tommy lee jones will get to them soon love movie and all part of it plot trailer screenplay act production and especially the making of as result of this passion happen to go lot to the movie theater analyze people reaction what they say what they think all that most of the time people be right and critic be wrong
horrible no scary waste of 2 hour for those of you say this be masterpiece or brilliant or one of the best scary movie ever have 2 word for you scr you what bunch of liar and for your scamming way to your fellow pay movie goer or red box renter may god have mercy on your pathetic lying soul you reviewers be pay on here be in the same class as lawyer and used car salesman just pure scum 10 out of 10 really your mother wouldn rate it 10 out of 10 know different stroke for different folk but this be draw out dumb idiotic not scary loser of movie what waste of 2 hour nothing even happen the first 45 minute not 1 thing the chick sound like beavis after he eat too much sugar horrible script horrible act it be so hard to follow switch back and fourth every 10 second be honor to say didn waste money pay to see it in theater hollywood need real writer not untalented script write kid just total waste of 2 hour don even rent this you be good off watch alien again for the 8th time
a solid addition to film noir chinatown excellently employ color contrast masterful use of shadow and intrigue reflection shots the cinematography and the meticulously write detective story highlight this movie as unmistakably noir it be miss few noir element such as unusual camera angle and intricately colorful dialogue but it still smooth and refresh addition one complaint be the relatively impassive character nearly every character have something to hide so they act as reserve as possible it understandable but it do make the movie little tedious when the audience be expect to care about the fact without care for any of the people involve noir film usually have the main character toe the line between likable and unlikable while stay emotionally detach as possible solely focus on unravel the mystery nicholson jake gittes give smooth and flawless performance in this role he deserve praise for this film but the rest of the reserve cast leave bit to be desire potential spoiler below another complaint lie in the conclusion which doesn feel adequately resolve the only one who can explain the situation be dismiss the end sequence make it seem as if the detective on the case have no interest in the truth and have vest interest in let crime go unpunished it likely that the truth will come out in court but the presentation of the conclusion leave sour taste for no apparent reason
poor film compare to the comic entertaining stand alone film guy this film isn fantastic lot of my favourite dialogue from the comic be cut and some of my favourite scene as well the end be that veidt have be work with doc man to create renewable source of energy to stop the conflict or so everyone think when really hes just building machine that simulate manhattan power to blow up new york pin it on him and they change lot of the spirit of the comic for example there a long unnecessary fight scene at the end between veidt and rorschach and nite owl totally unnecessary and obviously add to dumb the film down for more audience and as well as that some character be down play significantly or even take out entirely for example the new york news vendor doesn have single line and the psychiatrist subplot be cut and only one meeting with rorschach be show at all say that the action be good the cgi be incredible and some scene be hugely entertaining good overall film but disappointing adaptation in my opinion zack snyder have do incredible to stay so faithful to the original comic but the tone it take be different to how interpret the comic and the theme have be change significantly appreciate this film but don think will be watch the watchman again anytime soon sorry if seem cynical stress that be thoroughly entertain throughout this film but don go in with high expectation because its impossible to adapt such perfect piece of art
trailer doesn do it justice get weird impression from the trailer and kind of go in think wouldn like it don know why ever even doubt that would love harley maybe it because go in with low expectation but love it
engage from start to finish want to say first that like this movie also have to say that expect little bit more from movie that consider one of the best ever make and one of the best if not the best by many people movie ever direct by alfred hitchcock find it to be an engaging movie most certainly it never lose my attention there be enough go on that want to know how thing be go to turn out and there be even few situation in which it be impossible to know who side particular character be on all that work very well for me be also impress by the performance from the three primary lead cary grant be quite good as roger thornhill new york city businessman who through case of mistaken identity end up on the run as apparently eastern bloc agent try to pull off some sort of scheme that isn really reveal until close to the end of the movie thornhill be maybe little too good at time your normal businessman who seem to take too readily to the undercover espionage business but grant do well as the character james mason be the villain philip vandamm and be able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm just enough to make his character who could have be quite one dimensional interesting and of course there have to be beautiful woman in this case eva marie saint as eve kendall who become involve with thornhill but be actually work for vandamm m not sure that d agree that this be hitchcock fine performance as director he make movie that be engage but not really spellbind although he manage to do good job of gradually build the suspense certainly this be very good movie d argue though that it a wee bit over rat still very good though 7 10

the simpson movie be worth 6 chuckle six chuckle thats how much enjoy this movie now don get me wrong m big simpson fan always have be always will be however be not too impressed with the simpson movie find it to be moderate at best and do not compare to the tv show not the really funny classic episode at least it be like moderate episode stretch 90 minute sure there be few funny moment but wouldn at all call it hilarious and it sure wasn worth the wait or the hype first off the plot be weak and not worthy of 90 minute movie it could have be easily fit into single episode and the subplots be just slapstick repeat of old joke ie bart and homer bart and marge bart and flanders the support character be practically non existent and the one that do appear have really shallow line except for couple of funny line from flanders and ralph but thats about it and well the intro just suck the itchy and scratchy bit be out of place didn really integrate well into the movie as for the overall humor quality well it be average and disappointing it contain no thoughtful parody and only very trite satire many of the gag be childish slapstick humor can not carry prime time television show much less full length feature film it contain no complex subtext no intelligent obscure reference no hilarious musical number and no intricate visual humor many joke be recycle from old episode yet be very crudely put together know this isn the best review of movie you ll ever read it sure isn the best ve ever write but guess its just hard for me to critique the show love so much so hard and be try to be nice with everything say above and m sorry to report that the movie isn really worth the theater ticket but then again watch it at the theater might be the best way to get you to laugh during this film
the king have no clothes to say this be an unbearable movie would be an exaggeration it be bearable bearly for about 35 minute its an embarrassment to see this be associate with pixar can only imagine they be for ed to put their name on it to collect royalities it reek of disney and their predictable overly saccharine sentiment with an incipid story one dimensional character and mash of idea about theme and subplots as triumph of style over substance and nod to ersatz cultural enlightenment this be film that can even justify the evidence of its exostence visually it be mess and kind of over stimulated version of little child video game it be devoid of humor genuine humanist expression and superficial smattering of the day of the dead celebration the character be so flat that both alive or dead they re bore to compare this to typical landmark groundbreaking pixar movie call into question wonder exactly what people be watch during monster inc ratatouille the incredibles etc these early film take the legendary work of early disney animation artist and elevate it to an entirely different place they be layer broadly appealling entertain and have touch of social context and commentary truly wonderful movie that deliver view upon view the horse be out of the pen at this point but honestly what the hell be these positive reviewer watch
talk zombie be this joke angela be young woman who have just be kill by her angry ex but angela isn dead she one of the undead you see the recently decease have come back to life and these be not your typical zombie either they be organize intelligent and crave the flesh of the living craze cult of undead terrorist and militia of brutal zombie hunt human fight for dominance m fan of old school zombie flick where walk dead devours the living and that why highly dislike last rite of the dead undead can talk shoot search for job or drive car zombie roam the street hold job even have their own dating service online be this joke admittedly the script have some originality and fresh idea but prefer zombie flick with an constant aura of apocalypse and ton of gory mayhem the concept of intelligent zombie be beyond retard still the acting be pretty good some of the gore be excellent unfortunately last rite of the dead play more like an unfunny joke 4 out of 10
predictable with an asinine end with so many good movie come out in 1995 particularly mortal kombat and seven unfortunately there have to be some bomb as well and this film indeed fall into the latter category with bore predictable plot and lousy end it seem that antonio banderas hasn be able to find decent script since desperado the only remarkable film he do anyone with an eighth of brain could tell who demornay stalker be from the begin her flashback of the death of her mother do nothing but muddle an already paper thin story pity that dennis miller be waste in this film this part resemble his eerily similar role in the net the convoluted end have me shake my head as pretty much do throughout the entire movie plus any film that depict animal cruelty in any shape or form no matter how fake it look automatically get the thumb down from me to make long story short if you want to enjoy good thriller then avoid this at all cost never talk to stranger especially those who recommend this movie 2 10
just awful though it wasn until about an hour in that have realize this film be not go to treat the source material with dignity it be the opening scene of the comedian assassination that encompass everything that be wrong with the film the actual killing take about three minute to happen after the assassin show up which be two and half too many their fight go on as the comedian punch through wall and be throw through just about every glass object in the apartment before be toss out of the window by the time he be kill we ve already be take out of the moment by stylistic fight scene totally defeat the point of shock begin and that basically what this film do it throw around the fight scene and sex scene and gore without any notion of their weight no thought be give to nuance just spectacular visuals the main intellectual aspect of the original comic which be the entire reason it be such landmark be almost completely ignore the character be also completely dumbed down rorschach be no longer creative interesting face to hero but batman ripoff vigilante the entire back story with his mother be surmise in brief flashback which have the line should have have that abortion really couldn the nite owl silk spectre sex scene with the idiotic flame be take out to make room the only character treat with any dignity be veidt and dr manhattan though they be portray only adequately and no more basically the film be superfluous simplistic and rife with juvenile humor which belong nowhere near the watchman material snyder approach work with 300 mostly because the graphic novel itself be focus on epic battle and nothing else much as in the dawn of the dead remake though he completely miss the mark here and be unable to account for any social commentary or intellect
hang up the hawaiian shirt lasseter you ve sell out as an ardent fan of the first car be shock at what an absolute mess this movie be be prepare for certain level of disappointment from the trailer but didn expect the sheer second rate train wreck that be this movie all the heart of the first film have be chuck out the window on the way to cash in on merchandising possibility mcqueen have be practically relegate to minor character status here one wonder why owen wilson even bother show up occasional glimmer of clever humor be all but eclipse by rickety plot that can bear the weight of all it try to accomplish mater hi jinx as the centerpiece of ridiculous and unfunny spy plot go from annoy to disturb as the violence ratchet up while several critic have claim this sequel be aim at particularly young audience no other child movie you re likely to see in the near future do more to glorify gun violence pixar have suck all the dimensionality out of every return character and the new one it add be so one dimensional as to be nonexistent this be pathetic offering from studio that should know good
not masterpiece grim action movie with ok actor and ok story but it 39 not masterpiece tarrantino seam to add extreme violence and blood in all his movie just to shock the audience around the world his character be to one dimensional to my taste and think his style will be expose as cheap way to thrill in the future br br quot from dusk to dawn quot be mush good see that one in stead
turn out geriatric rambo be badass so must admit didnt have very high hope go in to see this movie the idea of man in his 70 39 playing this kind of character combine with the critic score which at the moment be appal low make me think this would not turn out to be good film be very wrong be happy to say br br just like the first movie in the series this movie have very important lesson embed in very gritty and entertaining story dont wish to include spoiler in this review so will just say in that regard that the story revolve around the naivety of youth bring up in secure environment and just not understand the brutality of the real world and the consequence that can have br br this movie be fairly gory which be not normally my thing but in the context of story look to highlight the brutal reality it have an important part to play in really bring that home to the viewer br br have to say this be great all round movie and if this be indeed the final chapter for the rambo character think it really go out with bang strongly recommend go to view this

you ll go gaga for la la land musical compose of the moment in dreams reality and everything in between la aa land be soul thrill intensely felt rollercoaster of emotion that even acrophobians will enjoy ride on this movie be strongly structure with soundtrack that will steal your heart purposeful camera techniques the subtle and realistic execution of act and major characterization throughout the entire film from the opening scene to the end credit mia emma stone barista with aspiration of become big time movie actress be too set in her bland reality to pursue her dream sebastian ryan gosling be just the opposite jazz fanatic wander his dreamworld hop that one day it will all be his reality and in the meantime unwilling to settle for any job that doesn fit his perfect idea of start his own jazz club when sebastian and mia find each other their first few run in be some what of an unpleasant nature from road rage during heat fill la traffic jam to rude encounter at bar childish teasing during party be what could have be the end of their encounter however fate fall into play and mia and sebastian fall into each other after long la party sebastian and mia walk to their car together along lamplit street and sunset sky the two share dance and sing duet say that they simply have no feeling at all towards each other it ironic that the two sing such thing in perfect harmony and with the synchronize choreography by mandy moore the scene be portray with such charm that it overwhelmingly captivate and honest the chemistry between them be as electric as the la city itself it very clear that the two complete each other strengthen their weakness through the others strong suit the way that movie be shot make or break film every angle every movement every frame mean something for instance when mia go to sebastian concert she start out close to the stage when the music pick up into sound that wasn sebastian style the camera linus sandgren take on wide angle shot and show the crowd of stranger push mia back far away from him this show us that as sebastian morphs into someone mia can recognize they will grow apart another example of why the filming be so important be when mia and sebastian go to the movie theater as their hand fumble into each others for the first time sandgren decide on close up shot to make it seem like that be solely the only thing you re mean to notice however the dialogue of the movie that play in the background the one no one would ever pay attention to discreetly hint at the end of the movie simply due to the shot chosen you only subconsciously pick up on it this be clever because you might not even understand they you know the end all along it until you watch it few time through be musical it obvious that one of this movie key component be the score justin hurwitz la la land composer do miraculous job at create music that allow the audience to connect and become invest with the character and their performance with three oscar nomination for his work in la la land it clear to the ear that each musical number be deliberately write to enhance certain emotion of every individual scene the music in this film often arise from soft dream like tune to lively upbeat and loud one this aid the audience in get sense of the reality verse the dreamworld and even get them catch in between the two although nearly every song go back and forth from soft to loud one specific song stick out the movie most popular song city of star be play many time throughout the film in different rendition each carry unique mood for instance it first introduction to the audience be when ryan gosling sings about the city all by his lonesome as he walk along pier in the early evening he sing the song as hopeless romantic like sebastian would in rather pensive and calm tone express that he drift into another dream in the second version of the song ryan and emma sing alongside each other it play with more upbeat mannerism at some point in this version the two even giggle playfully with each other this symbolize that together the star have never look brighter it show that they both have positive outlook on life and feel that dream be achievable in the third version the simplicity of emma stone hum the song tune leave the audience with light hearted giddy feel almost like daydream it show the effect that sebastian have have on her and at the end of the movie after we ve witness all that mia and sebastian have be through the track play once more this time it morph into all the song from the film for the big finale this bring back all the emotion we felt at once it overwhelm us in the best way possible and it an experience everyone should have the melody of this final rendition of city of star shift from hopeful and curious tone to one of remembrance as it be play differently than its past debut you get sense that it no longer turned page but the closing of book aside from the technical aspect of film culture such as film score and act la la land be enjoyable to the full extent not once be there an unintended dull moment and it not doubt to be one of the best film to arise in 2016 with 12 oscar nomination and 5 winner of best actress emma stone best cinematography linus sandgren best director damien chazelle best original music score justin hurtwitz and best production of design david wasco you should not worry about walk out of the theater disappoint

visually beautiful but the good part of the story be in another dimension it start of well and know by the trailer what be go to expect be wait for something beyond my expectation but when it become weirder it definitely become lot weird if you have see episode of the flash this film story feel like meh apart from the dialogue it definitely bad write the main character be completely clueless about be spider man but when the writer need him to use his skill voila he know it all like the back of his hand people who say this be the most visually stun film they have ever see be those who haven see film all those who have give this rating stand at 8 point something have be blow over the visuals of this film which be great but every film basic foot lie in it screenplay this be sloppy write aunt may be kind of iron man and all there be moment in every new super hero film where the hero fall short of confidence and then few scene or lot of scene later the confidence be regain here it happen in the very next scene what load of b spider man sticky web stick to his hand easily and be disturbance for him but it be conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky weband nicoles cage be you kid me his way of talk make it irritatingly meme funny depress his character be complete waste but definitely much good than captain marvel this film be visually stunning and the animation be excellent kudos to the animation artist but the writer need to write good
disappointingly dull this should have be fascinate story about how the sutton hoo treasure be uncover and the politics in society and the museum world at the time instead we get film that start off brightly but quickly drift off into number of subplots that didn go anywhere and don add anything to the story before petering out weird
be warn this movie suck be go to put spoiler in this review but it will probably be more entertaining than the actual movie to the point nothing happen in this movie that you haven see in every other movie captian america be involve in conspiracy that involve the company he work for see it captian america loose his leader and must try to figure out the differnce right and wrong see it captian america must stop world power see it blah blah blah this movie be nothing but repeat of movie scene that make good movie 15 year ago captian america defeat the bad guy only to save the bad guy the same action cost him be life oh wait some mysterious arm have reach out to save captian americas life who could it be be in total suspense for 27 second captian america get on shield intercom system and warn everybody that the bad guy the same bad guy from 70 year prior have take control and should be stop at all cost give liberate speech to all who can hear see it problem be who on board can remember or even be aware of and evil group from 70 year ago scarlett jo look terrible fake tan everyone wear pink lipstick can get past terrible story line if thing look good but of coarse captin america have to get his old suit out see it absoultey nothing of any importance happen in this movie tha bad guy isn stop the death of leader didn happen the world isn a good place captin america say shield have to be stop so he shoot down 3 airplane wtc think shield be little big than 3 air plane all the movie be be tv episode the bad guy be still there there be still problem to deal with and the stake get high no wait its not tv episode its sitcom
the jackson pollock of movie word of advice ignore review from people who try to tell you this movie be bit arty and special these be the same people who try to dissect jackson pollock painting and explain the splash to less mortal it worth 2 10 for the visuals which be spoil by the rest of the movie so 1 10 be generous this thing try to be something it isn it like french film with absolutely no plot then just at the end when you re start to get really bore and wonder why you bother nothing happens take away scarlett johansson and you re leave with bit of funky camera work take away the camera work and you re leave with absolutely nothing don waste your time unless you think jackson pollock splash be bit special
a disappointing tale be not bible thumper but would like to take bible and thump someone on the head with it namely those who write this script noah be an imagining of the biblical story not reimagining because the bible really doesn have much to say about the flood story that people really want to know the mechanic of it my goal be to go into the theater consider this film to be separate work from the book as do with all film if you pretend you know nothing of the original text be afraid this story do not stand well on its own first of all you would expect that noah would be the hero of the story actually he be about the least likable character in the film noah be man who have what he take to be revelatory dream through them he predict future happening and modify his life accordingly but he be very bad prophet because he never seem sure he understand the message the most dramatic part of the film be when he try to understand what the creator intention be for the race of man he think he know and he make bombastic speech about it but he obviously be not sure still he act on his best suspicion or intend to act when it come down to it he waver and teenage girl have to explain to him the basic of free will if you be hop for some interesting explanation about the mechanic of the ark and how all those animal be save you will be disappoint the explanation we get be like say that santa claus manage to visit all the home around the world in an impossibly short time because he have magic reindeer in the story noah have helper that be no less magical and the depiction of every specie of animal that crawl walk or fly since this story do not consider evolution none of the specie could have evolve after the flood be very lame don know what expect but it be something more realistic find the acting to be fine the most enjoyable aspect of the film for me be emma watson performance the special effect be okay but not enough to make me forget the deficiency in the story
painful mutilation of the great piece of fantasy literature be big fan of tolkien book but the movie doesn do justice to them at all and actually be major annoyance the scenery and most of the persona be actually depict very nicely but as soon as act and talk start it become plain that the story have be cut change dumbed down and vulgarize to such degree that nothing be leave of tolkien masterpiece and what remain be just an over length fantasy film with thin story and boring character the film have the subtlety of sledgehammer its fundamental assumption seem to be 1 if danger be such that the hero just might escape then it no real danger and must be enlarge to ridiculous proportion 2 comic relief can only be achieve through slapstick of the crude kind 3 battle scene must last at least as long as it would take five year old to read the corresponding passage backward in chinese moreover if they could be do without special effect they be bad and must be enhance 4 traitor must walk around with sign say be traitor the bad example for this lack of subtlety be that the ring be handle much too often too openly and with too little care this trivialize the sinister and threatening item and take away much of the power of the story the reckless exaggeration in the action scene be equally awful case in point the gate of moria scene when the watcher give frodo ride in the merry go round until everyone have chance to hack at him the more restrained story in the book be much more effective imho similarly mutilate be the scene crossing of the brandywine cut cushion in bree the burning of the rider at weathertop the drowning of sam gamgee wizard slug it out in orthanc and of course they have cave troll and really all of moria the main hero frodo give the impression of loser all the scene in which in the book he show courage wisdom resolve be cut or change bad find this in the key scene in the barrow cut and at weathertop there be nothing in the film give any hint why frodo might be the best hobbit in the shire due to the many cut or twist scene more than half of the character have little resemblance to the one in tolkien lotr frodo be loser merry and pippin be idiots until they suddenly turn out to be warrior prince elrond appear to be permanently piss off as if everything stink strider be just another warrior hero his be loremaster healer the great traveller of our time etc do not show galadriel and lorien be do so badly that wish it would have be cut completely more fair than thought of mortal men be tall order but jackson do not even manage fair only gandalf bilbo and saruman be render more or less well could go on nearly every scene have go wrong nothing of the depth of tolkien vision the attention he pay to detail not only visual but to fine tune the development of the main character or the poetry in his creation be convey what remain of the story be not tell in very coherent or convincing fashion neither the act nor the special effect be remarkable all in all complete and utter failure to turn great book into movie
i know it couldn live up to the rating miss this movie when it come out at the cinema because from what could see from the trailer and elsewhere it look bit silly for want of good word kid stuff perhaps we ve come to expect much more from comic book interpretation don get me wrong really enjoy the iron man series spiderman and batman reboots where draw the line think be with character such as thor and captain america and to lesser extent the hulk character who haven date too well at all and should have be leave in their respective time they just look so out of place sit along side the more believable and cooler look character like iron man in present day setting but anyhow have see the high rating the movie be get include on here think maybe it cant be so bad after all and give it look sadly my initial instinct be right this film be well make have great cgi and act but its entirely spoil by the inclusion of silly outdated character with dubious special power and guy who turn into cgi cartoon green man monster realise that it wouldn be as much of an assemble without these character and to substitute spiderman or other superheroes might well upset some purist but might have make for good film thor in particular be from bygone era of comic book and should have be leave there
don expect the matrix the film be set in fascist england of the future you can forget that the character be english because the keep say s all the time as grow up in london find this quite amusing as we just don speak like that guess that be what the future bring natalie portman give lukewarm performance but hugo weaving be excellent especially consider he be behind an expressionless mask it really be mask not keano reaves impression while well craft and well act this film be not ground break entertainment the special effect be good although when the action come it be bite bloody the idea of guy fawkes as anarchistic be amuse although totally inaccurate be sure many will like this film more than do so don let me put you off but for me it be like champagne with no sparkle
don chase after this dvd the chase have one of the best cast ever assemble at least three generation of hollywood be represent here from miriam hopkins and henry hull to marlon brando and angie dickinson and finally to up and come star like robert redford and jane fonda m still try to figure what all the fuss be about the film open with the luckless robert redford escape from texas prison with another convict who murder pass motorist and then take off strand redford he guilty even if he didn do the actual killing poor bob have no luck his wife jane fonda be not stay faithful and true but she be carry on with james fox the son of the local kingpin g marshall marlon brando be the sheriff who people think take his march order from marshall he like to bring in redford alive but for reason m still try to figure out everybody have this real hatred for redford and no one talk of anything else it all end rather badly for few of the cast arthur penn direct lillian hellman write the screenplay and with the cast they assemble you think something well would have emerge brando who sometimes be accuse of mumble his line do so with vengeance and look bore and the rest of the cast follow suit don think marlon brando most devoted fan would particularly like this one skip it by if it broadcast unless you re stargazer like me
melody when you look at musical as genre the train of thought be immediately follow by cheesy and cheeky end that you might ve see on any other film this doesn have any this do however contradict logic couple of time but movie be mean not to be perfect but to encourage perfectness despise musical but now after watch this must refute from my claim partially this movie have charm an aura beautiful color and beguile melody jazz be jazz throughout the movie the reverberation the clap the beat the shake the chord all blend into unison to concieve piece as great as this audio though be little brittle don know if it universal or for the theatre watch in watch it if you love musical and watch it if you hate them
m priest not saint agree that the movie doesn have to be the same as the book but have read the book and know that the story can be good than what portray here in this film so that why give 6 6 5 if didn know the original plot my rate would be high the main thing that didn like be the revenge part awfully lazy make and the end kinda disney cheesy for me the actual storyline be be more enjoyable and entertain
rent the dvd and get the special feature read some of the comment make about this film it do stay at very superficial level and leave the audience bit hungry at the end but not hungry for meat would have wish for more insight go deeper into the subject saw some comment about the poor acting and disagree think that all actor have part and be be nice to bring some star like bruce willis and ethan hawke rent the dvd and watch the special feature which contain 3 episode of the meatrix star moopheus the folk who create this cartoon deliver the same message as fast food nation in less than 15 minute learn as much and it be fun highly recommend
didn work for me noah 2014 director darren aronofsky consider that the noah ark story be fairly popular one and concise in its narration be quite interested in what aronofsky be go to spin honestly this movie didn work for me the amount of artistic license take be plenty and the movie pretty much end up be fairy tale the watcher fall angel who didn figure in any noah ark story till date the tyranny of tubal cain never reference him in any other noah ark story and the absence of the wife of ham and japheth as per the accepted various ancient version of this biblical story where 8 human travel the ark really didn work for me the casting be pretty good crowe connelly winstone hopkins and watson be top notch the son of noah be too young logan lerman from the percy movie be miscast here and douglas booth as shem be baffle with all the liberty aronofsky be take be root for them to die in the movie good special effect be the save grace of this movie and overall the movie be over rat if you haven watch it then save your time for something else rating 4 on 10
overrate do not belive the review this movie be not as good as you would think
not as good as hop the concept be good one to take on as there have be number of high profile abduction case over the past twenty year or so but wasn 39 totally convinced with the script on this one br br it be good effort in show the psychological problem and scar that the victim be leave with for me the best part of the movie be the last 15 minute they be the most realistic and the final narration by the young lad be well write but five year old wouldn 39 be that eloquent the first half of the story base in the room didn 39 really work well in my estimation br br despite that all the major player do fine job although wouldn 39 say oscar worthy wouldn 39 recommend people to go the movie theater to see this one you can wait till it come round on stream or movie channel or red box
a peckinpah classic with substantial flaw of all thing getaway be very uneven effort by sam peckinpah that doesn live up to its famous predecessor the wild bunch 1969 and straw dog 1971 with both it share the director know like for graphic violence preferably use slow motion gun shot and queasy moral standard that affect woman and men alike but too many flaw get in its way to make it truly great thriller the film open with very promise atmospheric prelude show doc mccoy steve mcqueen grapple with the hardship of prison life when his request for parole be reject by the prison board he summon his wife carol ali macgraw to barter an agreement with corrupt sheriff jack beynon ben johnson to get him release the price to pay or so it seem be bank robbery mccoy must carry out for beynon benefit when mccoy learn that he will have to work with two of beynon men his natural instinct tell him that he and his partner be in for trouble sure enough thing turn sour and mccoy be man on the run the main plot line be about deceit and suspicion mccoy near pathological mistrust in anyone cross his way repeatedly save his life but almost ruin it too as it threaten to terminate his relationship with carol as well the film be serve well by peckinpah utter lack of moralise impetus the only thing that make people tick in this movie be money and distrust and occasionally sex though that be more of an occupational gadget and life be fundamentally struggle against your next neighbour tellingly redemption safe and proper life lie beyond the border in fantasmagoric other territory in this case mexico which in itself reek of sarcasm though the main story have great moment in store and the filming be spotless the entire venture be at time obstruct by the overly caricatural subplot relate rudy butler al lettieri chase of his one day accomplice doc aside from quincy jones partly obnoxious soundtrack and notwithstanding the eternal toot thieleman harmonica spleen another major defection in conjure up the main protagonist inner turmoil the only ethical point if you will and give this film substance be macgraw sub zero act performance throughout if she isn a miscast who be and though mcqueen turn in standard no kidding act and most side act certainly deserve mention nothing will do to bring life into the love plot this in turn prevents the film from become true 1970s bonnie and clyde journey which would certainly have give it the edge it lack it be therefore no wonder that getaway unlike your classic crime romance end with happy end be it rather cold one fitting in with the overall sentiment that pervade the film but since it a peckinpah after all you win regret spending your money on it

michael bay please stop if could force one director into retirement it would easily be michael bay the man produce the most cringe worthy dialog and the most cliché sequence many may argue that if it wasn for him there wouldn be those big budget blockbuster uh correction if it wasn for those talented visual effect artist and million dollar executive producer then we wouldn have those movie yes realize that he be not direct this movie it be dj caruso job but can not help but think that bay will be pull all the string case in point nightmare on elm st the movie start out like any other michael bay flick every character be beyond good look the main character have trouble fit in there be always hot blonde who be australian and the first 30 to 45 minute be fill with boat load of high school drama sequence okay get it you hat jock as teen you do not need to make the quarterback the villain for the first half of the movie mean come on it a movie about closet superhero alien who be on the run from renegade bad guy from out space make jock the villain just doesn add up well unless m watch the disney channel however do think the concept for this film be alright it do have some slight potential but it be literally short live mainly because every single sequence be top off with the cheesy one liner honestly believe that if this film wasn put together by these two doofus then there might have be something here bottom line this movie would be great for your 8 year old in fact no it wouldn because couldn live with myself if raise my kid on crappy dialog fill movie it a dull witted attempt to create an men type series but it come off like the movie jumper oh wait who direct that again
you be not as stupid as christopher nolan think you be unless you call this movie masterpiece then you be damn 1 000 word limit get ta make this quick spoilers the film be 2 5 hour long yet feel like 5 2 and there be few reason for this one of which be the fact that preponderance of the first act be amateurish conflict free exposition which do not bode well for repeat viewing the learn about the dream world scene be atrocious no conflict both leo and page character already know what be be explain the similar learning about the matrix scene in the matrix do it right by have one character not know anything plus there be conflict neo get his as kick and fail to make the building jump much more entertaining there another problem with the whole section of bend the landscape where leo explain the negative aspect of alter the dream world the close we get to see the dream world alter be leo become mr charlie yet the most that happen then be bunch of extras turn and look at leo that it the idea be not exploit you literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity hell that mr charles scene be short than the scene that explain why alter the dream world be bad let not forget this whole idea of one corporation one upping another have absolutely no personal ramification for anyone on screen or in the audience it would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if leo have to struggle with the notion that help the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him or us or someone else anything could have work good than an energy contract that mean less to me than my neighbor bath mat come on the totem be handle very poorly all we need to know be their purpose we don need to know anything else yet the film keep pile on needless information if this be heist film where be the threat of be catch van fall for an endless amount of time joseph gordon levitt float body down hallway for half an hour real time the guy from bronson do his thing whatever the hell that be these be not complex task or event but rather straight forward in nature drag them out for solid chunk of the film be what create the glacial pace and make long film seem even long inception have no real villain you can make case for cotillard but she be an internal enemy she never take physical presence and never threaten anyone except leo everyone else be deal with faceless assassin that make it feel distant from the rest of the action it doesn even have anything to do emotionally with leo goal of get home to see his kid none of this be tie together leo didn even know what the hell be go on with cillian and never even know of the outcome until after the fact he separate from the physical manifestation of his goal for majority of the film end up not care if the plan succeed if it be all somehow tie together the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone be talk about but that didn happen in fact leo be so separate from the actual plot that you can literally put levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all hell you can even put page there since all she do after design the boring and lifeless dream world be hang out with the guy and tell leo he crazy really wish she have something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel leo lack of involvement in the main action of the story create so what moment when the problem be solve for him and can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict brody kill the shark in jaw he doesn send hooper and quint out to do his dirty work while he stay behind to deal with his fear of water it integrate the hero be force into deal with the physical and in turn but learn to conquer his internal fear before he can conquer his external opponent this be screen write 101 lesson 1 and nolan get that wrong that why don believe the report that he spend 10 year write the script since it only take me 148 minute to figure out exactly what be wrong with it not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else dream and control it mean that you would have to control your own subconscious which they state elsewhere be impossible way to go genius pretty much everything this film do wrong the matrix do right watch that instead ps the take scene from the middle and put it at the beginning gag reach its peak effectiveness in 2002 and have absolutely no place in modern film it get as bad as that tire old it all dream scenario oh wait

surprisingly mean spirited couple of commentator here g lady jane grey get it right the film start out rather affectingly with poor work girl lombard meet the wealthy wheelchair bound bellamy who treat her with great tenderness and obviously adore her but predictably if only from bellamy well know reputation for play also rans and the prominence of lombard and macmurray name above the title she fall for the macmurray character repellently shallow former playboy who snotty and rude to everyone he run into include mystifyingly lombard herself if you meet this smug smart alecky creep in real life believe me folks you would not find him charm you would flee macmurray snottiness be if anything make all the more unappealing because the movie have lombard and other character double over with laughter at his juvenile antic as if he the most hilarious fellow they ve ever see in addition to the obvious fact that the only generous mature character in it get shaft the film have particularly unfunny scene in which macmurray and lombard play cruel telephone gag on macmurray fiancée whom he engage to solely because of her money and whom he will ultimately dump despite her have magnanimously offer to forgive his unfaithfulness after trick the lady macmurray and lombard once again fall to the floor with laughter at how they ve put one over on her must say like lombard lot less after have see this one
possibly the most overrated movie ever make no country for old men share with other wildly overrated movie like pulp fiction or collateral ludicrous setting in which criminal engage in wild shootout and murder spree last for day and day without any noticeable effort on the part of law enforcement to put stop to it ncfom take place in an alternate universe where an insane madman can travel across texas murder several people day without the slight hint of the fbi dea s marshal texas ranger or any other authority lift finger to stop him the only cop who seem to be on his trail be an age small town sheriff play by tommy lee jones who doesn actually try to catch him but just passing amiably through life make philosophical reflection on evil this movie have no interesting or sympathetic character our suppose hero only get in trouble because he commit an unbelievably stupid and selfish act steal 2 million in cash from drug deal go wrong in which several people have already be murder do he think no one will come after him then he compound his idiocy by return to the scene of the crime why should we care what happen to him after this beginning he have what appear to be very nice likable girlfriend whose life along with his own he endanger for what some blood drug money that if the drug dealer don kill him for take the cop will bust him for spending stupid besides which the character have no backstory no interesting quality he be cipher the character of chigurh over which all the critic be have such orgasms might as well be an extraterrestrial he bear so little relationship to actual human life he appear to be in his late thirty kill people at rate of two or three day as he do in this film he must have murder close to 10 000 in his adult life without ever be apprehend this man be almost on par with stalin hitler mao and pol pot except instead of kill people en masse as they do use subordinate secret police and soldier to do the dirty work he appear to do every kill himself many of them with some kind of oxygen tank how clever and how convenient it must be to lug around an oxygen tank to kill people with instead of say handgun and there be no fbi team on his tail no worldwide manhunt to catch the big serial killer of all time it funny how many professional assassin there be in movie like this and pulp fiction and collateral and how few there seem to be in real life the plot of this movie be so unbelievably trite clichéd and hackneyed that it be simply boring of course trite story can still make great movie if it be well do but the coen brother be far above actually put in the effort to make their story work effectively on nut and bolt level for instance why bother to show the ultimate confrontation between the hero and villain why would the audience care about that on some level the coen brother must be laugh at all the sycophantic critic fall all over themselves to heap orgasmic praise on this joke of movie this film and its ecstatic critical reception represent the ultimate elevation of style over substance the appearance of meaning over actual meaning quirkiness and moodiness for its own sake rather than in the service of genuinely engage story and character

overrate now don 39 get me wrong the film be alright but its nowhere near as good as the cult follow this film have make it out to be on the plus side the cast be definetly great all the principle be completely immerse in their role and give magnificent performance however the directing do feel bit amateurish at time and the script be out and out weak the story revolve around botched diamond heist where the thief involve suspect one of their own be rat don 39 know if it be because of small budget or just weak script but the story doesnt come off as good as it sound br br for starter the film use very disjointed mean of tell the story however there 39 no real flow to it most of the movie be set in warehouse after the robbery with the charachters try to figure out the snitch you 39 think the movie would build up to this fact but it get reveal midway through fair enough in fact the part of the movie that go into the snitch 39 story be probably the best part so you 39 think there 39 be some really big conclusion instead right not really this film have get to have one of the weak most abrubpt ending 39 ve ever see hell they never even actually show the robbery which sound interesting and be something would have like to have see as viewer but instead its only refer to so if you 39 re really big on violent crime film fine go ahead and give it go but be warn its nothing compare to the work of say guy ritchie and if you 39 re just see this movie to find out what all the buzz be about you 39 re go to be really dissappointed go rent something like jackie brown or snatch instead
really want to like this movie m fan of scarlett johansson like original material like this but wait for something great to come out of it but when finish it just think it be dumb btw watch movie for entertainment purpose not for some slow type of arthouse crap that try to make statement
a lesson with sir michael caine this be not good film but first rate lesson about the nature of film making when you start out you have no equipment no fund no star no technology no clue but hopefully good story many year later when you ve come up in the world you re shoot scene with sir michael caine in plush mountain resort which you and your crew be occupy for month on end you have set expert designer cameramen sound people beautiful extras the work you might feel like you re on top of your game but when you don have great script with good story and dialogue all the great set designer in the world and not even sir michael caine win be able to stop the movie from go down the drain because make movie be not much more than tell two minute fireside story with lot of ballast watch this movie because of the witty photo with smc sir michael caine and harvey keitel ogle babe at swim pool unfortunately that turn out to be the only appeal aspect of this movie
disappoint watch this my child 11 and 13 as quot treat quot sorry kid br br have be big fan of pixar from day one but this movie just didn 39 work without doubt the animation be excellent but where be the storyline the characterisation and sadly the laugh br br the strength of movie of the calibre of toy story be that within moment the audience forget it be watch cgi and get wrap up in the story and character with ratatouille the sole strength be the cgi br br would have much prefer to watch movie with ok animation that have an interesting plot but here all the energy have be put into make rat fur look realistic br br get 4 out of 10 for be visually stun and beautifully execute would have grab 10 if the script and characterisation have be up to expect pixar standard
not work the casting be miss all around star with the lead add to that bad attempt to add humor and clever sarcasm to murder mystery and it just mean nothing be work different cast well write and focus on murder mystery might have salvage this but it not engage enough to even care who do it
not das boot know it dangerous go to movie with expectation but not know very much about downfall except for its excellent review here at imdb com be anticipate something like das boot with brown dirt for green water as film this drama execution be quite superb the audience seem transport into hitler bunker during those last day of the war the city above be wreck and so be hitler boy and girl and the elderly must take up futile position against the advance soviet troop no need for another plot synopsis here it be well cover by the previous post here somewhere into this long and very engaging movie chill set in yes these german be real people not monstrous demon and this movie wasn portray their day here as heroic but then something very odd strike me during the scene where the solitary hitler contemplate his inevitable end poignant music play in the background it sound familiar and my mind reach back to my music school day to place it it from johann sebastian bach mass in minor specifically the crucifixus here in the film score it appear sans word and chorus but the music be distinct and powerful originally intend to evoke the tragedy and sacrifice of jesus christ he be crucify for us make to suffer and be entomb here it be an offense be this the real point of view of the film be this its purpose to portray hitler as grand person who suffer persecution and betrayal or be read too much into what be only an element of the drama well albert speer be portray as dapper an architect in suit rather than minister in uniform intelligent urbane and compassionate man he and hitler have conversation about their lost future over speer model of the berlin that be to be yet wasn speer beloved of hitler out of compatible grandiosity wasn that berlin to be dominate by palace with dome thousand foot high didn this culture architect become hitler minister of weapon and armament and ruthlessly use slave labor in the service of the third reich in this film he be rather unfortunate artist catch up in the whirlwind of the time no way no doubt the german be real people how do they get talk into this grand barbaric and murderous scheme yes they be like us so could this happen to us too don see this movie don shed tear for hitler and don even entertain the notion suggest in this movie that he be persecute and betray savior don participate in the rehabilitation of nazism

big dumb fun be ok this certainly isn the bad movie ve ever see but it far from the best if you go into it with an open mind just want to be entertain and not expect anything cerebral than you ll likely be amuse the good ray park as snake eye ray park never disappoint his martial art style and amazing flexibility shine through here too be pleased joseph gordon levitt probably the best performance of anyone in the movie right up there with park be very impressed with his portrayal of the half mad genius doctor he capture the atmosphere of the character dead on you ll enjoy him every second he on screen lot of the pov shot be very cool esp the joe plane the attention to detail in most part of the film be really very good particularly the shot of the city grid below when complicate sky shot be occur even if it be cgi it do very well and doesn look fake the traffic action sequence be nicely do as be the destruction of the metal object of different height and length also enjoy the transition from scene to scene esp during battle match what the plane be do and then morph to the submarine in similar position be pretty cool your all around performance by the rest of the cast really aren too bad but at the same time isn anything remarkable either the bad if you re expect any character development don there really isn any few character have few brief flashback to establish quick part of their life but it really isn anything substantial or particularly revealing don expect anything special from the dialog either it not deep and most of the time not really particularly interest it not necessarily monotone as much as it be flat and consistent few character ever seem to be astonish or overwhelm by the situation battle action sequence they ve find themselves in m willing to believe this be casualty of act in front of green screen with mega effect and explosion add post production or just lazy script writing and the failure of the director to envision what will eventually be add and direct his actor to feel it the movie be laughable unintentionally in certain part mostly thanks to cornball dialog and occasional over the top acting few nit picky item have with the movie why be it all the woman have this long hair all over the place all the time even in the heat of battle seem to me ponytail could at least have be utilize instead super model hair abound oh well could we make the cobra commander cooler mask in the cartoon he have this faceless mask that you never saw through it be simple and yet effective in it design get all excite in this movie when the doctor finally don his commander mask only to have it look like something you use around your house when do project cover in something cheap look shiny with large clear plastic eye hole if gordon levitt could pull performance that surpass expectation than surely the effect department could whip him up mask to match

a rare film that challenge the viewer to come up with his own interpretation faithfully follow chuck palahniuk acerbic satire fight club present the vast emptiness of modern existence ridden as it be with shallow value rampant consumerism empty of mean feeling and life itself in slick and ironically consumer orient fashion in different vein from american beauty fight club explore the solution to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plague modern life the film be violent but it be not gratuitous violence and any reviewer who claim that the film be promote violence have miss the entire point of the film very black comedy it be sure to provoke much conversation it be definitely film to see with friend the film be fast paced densely pack and merit second view just to take it all in especially if you haven read the book in typical fincher style you the viewer be leave to draw your own conclusion he feel no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you ve see appropriate since the film condemns fall victim to the stricture of what society tell us to think and to value my only criticism be that the editing be not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film it drag just bit then pick up again other than that it should definitely be an oscar contender

inspire me what can say this film blow me away and inspire me to write to trump secretary the chief constable of grampian police force and my first review on imdb from the title we know the story and the film be efficiently execute shot on hand hold and use resident footage with some clip of local hero as subject it be fairly easy to portray trump as an evil man however the film excels at capture how the system design to protect place and people can be corrupt it explore the cult of personality and the immense power of business the blatant corruption of state government the developer lawyer educational institution local politician and ultimately provide the centerpiece of the film the police like trump none of the antagonist make any attempt to hide that they have be completely debase by celebrity money and power the film contrast this with the almost gentle stoicism of the resident in the face of what be in reality helpless situation through their eye we see the destruction bullying and land grab they stand in contrast to the aberrant force in front of them for me what be most shocking be that this take place in scotland not china would like to have see more counter argument the upside of development and the job the complete golf course will provide ultimately though it be the local authority that damn themselves in their action instead of their word very powerful piece of film make hope it reach wide audience

now this be some high quality crap it be almost impossible to imagine that in 2015 as movie audience experience the golden age of superhero movie that there can still be crap like this somehow someway fant4stic reach into the depth of awful superhero movie and take the crown for be one of the bad superhero movie of all time let start with the lack of story or even simple plot for starter we really aren even introduce to some resemblance of plot until an hour into the movie and even then the plot essentially boil down to doom suck hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet which be completely bare consider that synopsis think it be almost safe to say that this movie doesn even have plot or one that at least make sense ok so the movie doesn have genuine plot that be the case with some other superhero movie it should at least have some cool action scene or provide some worthwhile visuals nope honestly can only recall maybe five minute of some actual action and even that be happen it be absolute crap there be multiple opportunity throughout the film to showcase their power especially in the scene with reed richards and ben grimm but instead all we be leave with be crappy one liner even in the last 10 minute when we get the big battle it end up be boring uneventful cliché and yes crappy letdown so we ve get no story no action no villain win even waste my time with dr dumb how about some witty dialogue or couple of humorous scene wrong again in its attempt to be the dark knight of fox superhero movie fant4stic be strip of all the humor and campiness that at least make the earlier fantastic four movie watchable instead we get dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom the joke be laughable except there not and just about all the interaction between character feel force and inauthentic ok so by now you get the idea fant4stic be an absolute crap shoot of movie movie void of plot action and ok dialogue doesn even deserve to be call by its name hence the fant4stic it make the early fantastic four movie look like the avenger and in the end serve as an embarrassment to anyone associate with the film and if you be wonder yes it be even bad than batman robin 0

more like the team typically enjoy mindless action movie that have paper thin plot and usually nothing else to offer albeit the team be mindless summer blockbuster and have paper thin plot but it just isn fun not only isn it interest but it also suffer from an abysmal script poor direction and very average performances the major issue be not that didn like the team hat it and the strange thing be have no expectation wasn expect anything because didn even want to see it that much moreover you know how many summer blockbuster have high production value wow here production value have be toss out the window be this what hollywood have resort to film with big explosion and zero fun wow never think you could screw up simple mindless action flick but guess the impossible just turn into the improbable d speak about the plot but most of you know it by now and it as thin as cardboard cut out well ll talk about the positive which be very scarce first of all think liam nesson performance be pretty good second of all think the action be slick that about it now let head to the negative which be very overbear first off think this movie be unnecessarily boring and just chore to sit through from the very beginning of this movie be not hook at all with what be see the running time be just shy of two hour but it feel like an hour and half long second of all think the performance be bland do not care about any of the character with the exception of liam nesson they be obnoxious rebellious and unintelligent in every sense to add to that think the direction be lousy this movie be just all over the place lack coherency additionally think this movie have way too much action understand it an action movie but be it really necessary to have explosion every two minute come on now that a bit inane moreover think this movie be heavily nonsensical nothing make sense and the hole in the script be the size of texas to put the icing on the cake think the dialog be just awful every time joke come on screen my laugh resort to sigh and then inevitably to yawn and every time touch speech appear cringe rather than felt inspired overall the team basically just stink the dialog performances script direction and writing be just so unnecessarily bland this be come from man who like mindless action picture and thing that go boom in the night have zero expectation and go in with an open mind and basically just hat this movie to be honest don understand the appreciation and love for this movie what be so great about yeah the action set piece be pretty slick but that the only plausible thing about the movie the fun factor be lack and it be lack big time chance be you re most likely to disagree with me but the team believe be one of the bad movie ve see this year such huge disappointment
total oscar bait but at least part of it entertain kevin spacey for me remain the most memorable thing about american beauty he have all the best line his character be the most interesting and his midlife rebellion be genuinely funny but that revolt be only the first half of the film this movie isn nearly the bastion of depth that it be when be nineteen the angst and twisted side of suburbia feel fake on the nose and that triteness be at its bad when we delve into ricky subplot the fly bag be where the movie teeter on insufferable bentley not the problem he seem well suit for the role same for the rest of the cast but there an unmistakable smugness to the writing of this thing that ruin whatever beauty this story have

beautiful on many level and even though formulaic manages to arouse the sens expect great thing from pride but be bowl over by the level that it hit home pride be reminiscent of other great british comedy drama and say that without remorseful flinching often the tag of classic british comedy be use to promote movie irrespective of any true consideration more simple quality by association rather than afford an objective representation be pleased to say that pride delivers and carve itself the right to associate itself with other great film such as billy elliot love actually brassed off four wedding and notting hill for example for me its unavoidable feel to brassed off the acting by all the major player be exceptional and ham to perfection at time pure pantomime yet at others so tender and subtle that it assist at assimilate the theatrics into the very real life account of truthful yet unlikely marriage of two very unlikely bed fellows lesbian and gay action group and community of strike miner and their family the association however unlikely on superficial examination isn quite as absurd as one would think marginalise and hat by the common medium in thatcherite britain the film negotiate the story beautifully and engages by perfect balance of poignant reflection and humour grow up in thatcherite britain and applaud this as more true representation of the legacy of the iron lady than recent sensitive biopic the film occasionally derail itself at dramatic grab for belly laugh in true english seaside postcard style reminiscent of the carry on legacy on the whole though exceptionally well draft and excellently craft humanistic review of what it be to unite in common cause against adversity ben schnetzer paddy considine andrew scott and dominic west be all standout and brilliant bill nighy be bill nighy and the film as all of the film he have be in benefit from it jessica gun be delight and rich seam of mined talent as be faye marsey imelda staunton be as always exceptional although be principal in some of the movie overt clumsy grab for humour be prepare to laugh cry at both pole of emotion and thoroughly enjoy the experience brilliant and must see in my opinion
a good idea flaw by thunderously bad script david cronenberg have style with his film that be unmistakable he be unafraid to address the darker aspects that lie within us all that he push this idea over the limit of viewable film be reflect in some of his popular film such as dead ringer the fly spider existenz naked lunch etc yet despite his apparent love of gore he drive home point that should be consider most of the time he work with good script for history of violence he be hamper by one of the most pedestrian hackneyed adolescent script try to pass as big time movie josh olson adaptation of the grisly pulp novel by john wagner and vince locke tom stall viggo mortensen be introduce to us as the head of hallmark happy wappy family in indiana with his wife edie maria bello son jack ashton holmes and daughter sarah heidi hayes sure jack be harass at school as faggot by group of loser but he take it on the chin tom own diner where everybody just love him until one day when couple of thug disturb the placid boredom of the place and end up dead at tom too facile hand tom becomes town hero but the glow soon fade as big time crime enters in the guise of fogarty ed harris plus thug who enter the diner and confront tom that he really be one joey cusack previous life killer from philadelphia tension mount and ultimately tom kill the intruder only to come to grip with some reality that be threaten and unpleasant and turn his family 180 degree against him in one of the most absurdly write reversal of family commitment ever write in fraction of second the rest be resolution of the joey cusack enigma and then the film just stop the actor try to make this mess work but the line they be require to murmur be just too bad to digest but if you like gore and battered body and spree killing and dark motif with secret agenda then the film may please but how it get attention in the first place be bit difficult to believe the accompany featurettes on the dvd show all the secret behind the gore and include scene eventually delete for good reason grady harp

interesting premise and weird animation but ultimately bore the animation be like tokyo godfather and perfect blue the story be mix of the cell the one with jeniffer lopez and ghost in the shell the music be very well choose now the basic feel of the movie be great lot of tension keep go by the music and the spirit of the collective consciousness that permeate ghost in the shell but that just the first quarter of the movie afterwards there be lot of dreamscapades that make no or little sense the feeling of it fade the film become self referential like scene that do not have any meaning before now be mix in the story and nothing really ensue from this chaos the bad guy be pretty obvious and the end be completely confusing bottom line pretty interesting concept carry by very appropriate music crash in confusion of course if you make the effort you will understand lot of the metaphor and some of the spirit of the film but ultimately it just some japanese guy dream that not all of the viewer can really share

an important message tarnish by goofy film technique although the purpose of this film be to denounce the use of nuclear weapon so hat the style of the film that the message be largely lose on me while love some of the the director other work night and fog be brilliant be annoy by the artsy tone of the film and the excessive reliance on new wave sensibility ll be honest and up front about this hate most of the godard film have see and several of those of resnais strange camera angle and the avoidance of normal movie convention may impress some but felt lose hat the goofy poetry like dialog that be use while scene go back and forth between the lover and documentary footage of the civilian of the hiroshima post blast it seem to trivialize and muddle the impact of their pain so why do give it 3 and not 1 well have see lot of french film and there be some whose level of awfulness reach far great height than this film and there be some that be absolute masterpiece if you think this film be bad try watch alphaville or last night at marienbad now these be really bad french film
a story that could be realistic one have hear about unforgiven as an unexpected classic and with those comment in my mind watch the film few day back it turn out to be classic at the end unexpectedly the greatness come from the story not the story line but the story that could be felt inside by the viewer the morale of the story be as simple as that of how much you tame your instinct and violence it sure would come out at sometime the story be unpredictable because of its strange character william munny eastwood be indeed once notorious thief murderer gun man he shoot and kill many of them such that he lose their count but he be love by rich good woman she marry him off come out from her wealthy mom why how come she turn him out into noble man who never touch drink and the gun thereafter they have two kid even her death by smallpox make him even nobler claudia watch up from heaven he drive by situation pick up the 1000 reward offer for kill the two who cut of night girl face out of arrogance why these night girl instead of run off from that bad place and bad bos announce bounty for those lad who cut them they want to punish the evil young men in spite of who they be and what they be and their inability to fight against their owner and the sheriff little bill gene hackman the sheriff who be actually strict in hold up the law and order in the town be not the hero because all the goodness he talk do not make one think he be good instead he sound cynical indirectly support the owner of that bar cum brothel house he even punish those lad not for justice but in favor of the bar owner and ned logan morgan freeman who be munny ex partner marry to an red indian woman who regard munny always as bad person play good friend of munny and turn munny finally to be unforgiven there be lot more character add strangeness to the story schofield kid beauchamp the cut woman etc the story at the end stand for munny he have conscience of his own he have cross its boundary for long time then retreat to normal man who strive to live good life to the extent of monogamy and then flare back but this time his conscience itself cross the boundary set by itself define new boundary of his life for one time one sample for the strangeness of munny character be this when they hit the first boy he put off the gun fire and ask the other boy to give him water know he might die soon no matter what do good or bad it be important that my conscience allow me to do it it be not the external world that decide my good and bad but my conscience that be why we see very bad people have very good character and very good look people have very bad character even you do good it be not good enough until your conscience tell you good and bad thing be not bad enough as long as the conscience be ok with it the movie contain lot of such character wander around the story in real life we see such character lot that be why it be unexpectedly classical in nature

many plot hole but solid work of sci fi overall with some worthy moment first the good stuff black hole and other imagery be top notch accurate as confirm last year by real life observation this be by no mean 2001 space odyssey just as nolan be no kubrick but the movie be ambitious and do have strong point there be lot of thing that make no sense however first the nature of the apocalypse on earth be completely nonsensical but on the other side the oft criticize end by the scientifically illi terate make much more sense than lot of otherwise blindly accept part especially if you take into account that once you go speculative you can not be that wrong there be some sound strong sci fi along the way but lot of nonsense point have to be give too though many be save by the almost brilliantly consistent end and lot of sci fi theme be nicely incorporate and show to stimulate imagination in some capable kid there be also strong extra point give for respect of the father as single fatherhood be vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday the daughter scientist be celebrate despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarize work of future generation transmit by her daddy which be take as her modest denial in culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroine of discipline for which for many century include decade of in ane positive dis krimination they be prove to be bit too soft in the head for touche if subtle punch that irritate the critic extra point for matt damon play nas ty man he always seem to me to be overall flaw but inspire piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority
this movie be terrible this film be truly terrible one of the bad film have ever sit through and ve see pearl harbour the story line be unbelievably clichéd with the boy who mother have marry new man who be very successful but also boring and the father who be total failure but with dream of big thing know its meant to be light hearted but it be simply vacuous the entire plot be probably write on the back of cigarette packet which be then lose before filming commence for some reason an egyptian pharoe can speak the same language as attila the hun and roman speaks english film like jumanji be fun because they be really fantasy base so you can accept whatever happen what completely undermines night at the museum be the very fact that it be set at museum and an opportunity to provide child with few fact along with bit of fun be lose by stagger degree of dumbing down
such good start such lousy outcome the premise be good that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turn people into brainwash flock only to scream yes yes yes at ridiculous guru finger snap and its impact over one life and for almost one third of the movie the humor work well carrey be his old self old also in the negative sense again again again the same grimace but at least we guffaw in laughter often enough unfortunately around half way the script turn messy dissociate incoherent it depart the efficient logic that have lead it till then and the fun get repetitive and ever more tired in the end it leave us with the fateful question and so what but at least it be some comedy mediocre but still amuse not as the ton of trash that the hollywood showbiz delivers all year long under the apatow and seltzer signature thank god for the small favor and small time comedy
didactic and overlong another one of those overlong morally right on movie that never rise above average save only by the act its bleed heart politics dignity of individual maintain in adverse condition be play out well enough but actually lack any real dramatic tension dufrane be two dimensional character who seem to go through the drama by number there never any doubt that he will triumph in the end it only matter of how tim robbins have do many more interesting film than this one try the player or bob robert if you re look for drama moral ambivalence and how they interact basically there be lot good prison film than this one jailhouse rock for starter like most stephen king story quite prosaic there be story in here somewhere but it get over inflate and somewhat lose along the way none to watch on rainy day when there nothing better to do 1
it a masterpiece best movie of all time braveheart be the best movie ever make in history an absolute sculpt work of art that depict every emotion of human existence from suffer to courage to love in front of the background of political astuteness and socio hierarchal analysis tell the quasi true story of one man conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hand of the ruthless king edward the ii of england who in turn inspires his small province of scotland to rebel and go to war in real fight for freedom and independence braveheart be stun depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds defy tyranny and achieve justice respect and dignity against oppression although its retractor and critic will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie particularly what part robert the bruce play in real life there be no deny the true power and emotional influence of this movie it understandable particularly for european how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in study history but the movie be not really about be historically perfect it a work of art about thing much deep documentary it be not and it duplistic and hypocritical for the film hater to dwell on this minor detail but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it free pas in something like tarantino inglourious basterds or once upon time in hollywood on this topic one of the dozen of best part in the movie be when robert the bruce play an important role in one of the battle and eventually the movie do come around and get robert history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for scotland independence without try to get the history perfect this movie be simply flawless it beyond flawless really flawless movie can just be technical masterpiece with very little power but the raw power and emotion come off the screen in practically every single scene in braveheart be like an inferno james horner score be one of the great score ever for any movie and it successfully enhance the drama and emotion of each scene without come across as manipulative it fit perfectly into every single scene it be use there isn one act role that be not well do this be one of gibson best act role and the guy who play edward ii give an outstanding performance this be the great epic movie ever create in the history of hollywood few year later another great modern epic gladiator come out and draw rightful comparison to braveheart but while gladiator be very good movie it lack in the emotional depth power and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watch braveheart the final act of braveheart be one of the most powerful ever put on film as first time viewer you really have no idea where the story be go to go even as repeat viewer it still hold weight to this day there be still nothing like it just when you think it over or you know how it will end it just continue to twist and turn and then it close with what be probably the best end of any movie in history in addition to all of this the body of braveheart be load with outstanding battle scene incredible editing and great dialogue root in inspiration political strategy philosophy and stunning human experience of love desire passion suffering and identity when you look at the top rat movie on imdb it be laughable that comic book movie and good popcorn fun movie be actually rat above this this be without doubt hand down one of the top 25 movie ever make and in my opinion it be the 1 best movie of all time this movie be masterpiece
not sure that everybody want some of this this nostalgia piece from director linklater follow the hijinks of college baseball team in the day before class begin imagine bunch of competitive young guy live in the same house in texas in 1980 and you will have imagine this movie without have to see it party sex drug sport game camaraderie it all do with light touch and be sure it be fun for linklater to actualize some of his fond memory on screen but find little originality to it some force humor and philosophize most of the actor seem about 5 10 year too old for their part the big weakness of the movie be that never get to know any of the guy beyond most superficial level would take that comment back if one of the point be that there be nothing beyond the superficial for these guy it be pleasant surprise to see that most of the guy could actually play some ball except we never saw the main character make pitch just the ball heading to the plate kind of like an actor fake play piano while show the hand of real pianist
more like documentary in wolf of wall street jordan belfort try to explain what he be do and then he say that we be probably not go to get it anyway and all that matter be that he be make lot of money well this movie try to explain everything and some thing it do and others it doesn but the whole point of the movie be explain how the crisis happen and why it be more of documentary than drama it try to be bite like wolf of wall street with the breaking of the fourth wall which be ok with what be not fine with be the direction which be bit sloppy on purpose to give it more of documentary feel which didn like also it be very informative but it doesn have much entertainment value love dialogue in film but in this one just didn understand what they be talk about in some instance the story could have be present in good way but it be still worth see just to see how we be be use by the bank just for the message and what it expose give it high grade than would have which would probably have be 5
two word lackluster and mediocrity how do potentially good movie jam pack with excellent talent manage to stumble into forgettable mediocrity it seem the cast be tight and fire on all cylinder the director be do his thing superbly and production whatever they do be more than adequate guess so what happen do it seem like there be some major character disconnect it felt that bit there be moment in the story when the plot be more like disorganized smattering of unruly louse than some kind of storyline be it too long again time be relative and for me this show be relatively too long predictable oh please this be your typical bad cop v badder cop v baddest cop might be too hard on this flick don know be probably spoil by some of the quality tv crime drama you know the one that have good writer and last an hour la confidential be just not spectacular tale it be almost boring don get me wrong this be not bad movie it be actually pretty good it just not great to put it another way a confidential be like chevy corvette outfit with vespa engine all flash and no gut apologize to those who love the movie but win lose sleep over it this story need to be re bury in that woman smelly basement at least for me
a very ambitious effort from darren aronofsky but also an uneven one judging from the hate noah have get on here be expect very little actually noah be nowhere near as bad as heard and while very flaw and by far the bad film of darren aronofsky with his others range from very good to outstanding it do have some impressive thing on the most part the film be brilliant visually the barren apocalyptic landscape and later more colourful one be really striking and the cinematography have sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect the opening and creation sequence be beautifully do with the latter quite harrow without be too heavy hand and the flood scene be intense and jaw dropping in spectacle noah dream have real creepiness too clint mansell music score swell thrillingly and have an epic sweep enhance crucial scene and not drown stuff out the sound be thrill in its authenticity too there be some good performance the best of which come from russell crowe who play with real steel and powerful charisma jennifer connelly be sympathetic and touching wife and mother figure and have scene in the last act that really do hit home and be not over the top some have dislike emma watson performance but for me she bring genuine heart to role that be more of plot device up until the last act at that point she become the character you relate to the most anthony hopkins do not have much to do but he be gleefully enjoyable in his role of methusalah noah do personally fall very short though and actually the little relation to the bible no matter how people carp on about it be the least of its problem douglas booth be rather bland and too pretty boy model like while logan lerman come across as wooden and force ham could easily have be the character we relate to but for that to happen think the film could have expand much more on his character arc and situation ray winstone be the most disappointing he do some great performance but this be not one of them he be saddle with very clichéd villain role that have no development to him and he overdo it in way that feel straight out of another film entirely the character generally be underdeveloped especially the villain and ham subplot have potential to be expand much more but ila character have lot of heart and effort be make to humanise noah although some of his decision making come across as rather sudden the special effect be mixed bag the flood effect be outstanding and the build to scale ark also look incredible both of which with much grandeur but the rock monster or the watcher have date look be write in way that feel irrelevant to the story or in way that doesn gel with everything else go on and slightly like transformer clone and some of the animal notably the snake look like computerise toy that don blend within the scenery very well the dialogue do often feel stilted and confused especially in the first act while take an overwrought if well intentioned turn in the last and come across as little heavy hand in place the story do have number of bright spot and contain some powerful messaging but do drag fair bit and have some stuff that felt like filler the film easily could have be half an hour shorter the story be also bit of weird one and one that leave more question than answer in sense that it do feel like it doesn quite know what it want to be there some sci fi some action epic and some character drive study which take up the last act all three of which with uneven result the end be for my liking bit too convenient as well aronofsky direction be broad and be at home with the style of the film and the spectacle but he fail to make the story properly engage which be unusual for aronofsky overall ambitious but uneven noah be nowhere near as bad as lot of the negative review have say and the stick it get for not be close to the bible be on the unfair side in all fairness though noah be advertise in way that be suggestive that it be an adaptation of the biblical story when really it be the bare bone but it do have lot of flaw and could have be well consider how much talent be on board 5 10 bethany cox
mister anderson you disappoint me in his review of this overblown and disappointing shovel ful of lard hype say disappointing because the writer producer the matrix be wonderfully inventive and character drive my man roger ebert ask be this movie parable about 2006 cautionary tale or pure fantasy puhleeeeease mon man mean how overt do roll of celluloid have to be before you give it the sledgehammer award for heavy handedness for me this film be huge disappointment because my expectation be so high base on how much enjoy the matrix and bind both write and direct by the brother who screen script and evidently leave their second man jam mcteigue hang out to dry as director on this one there be nothing subtle about the contrived and preachy analogy between the totalitarian bad guy in and the targeted real world counterpart and conservative ideology in the west the problem with the politically motivated axe grinding that show up in film like be that any effort to produce more encompassing honest and human depiction of character and event be subsume to the desire to propagandize and preach with the passage of time film like becomes more trite and embarrass while film like the matrix become more establish and entrench in our heart and mind artist who eschew that which be most universal and central to the human condition in order to rail against personality party fill in the blank of the ephemeral and always shift political landscape give away so very much to preach point that be already tire and lame by the time they hit the screen will always love the wachowski bros best work but this one isn worth the time it take to view it

one man one watch this to my taste be another clumsy deal center on an exist product the attempt at be visually coherent should be more successful than they be its mess visually and rhythmically there be two thing that impress me though think the rorschach character be very successful in part because he push strong path through the chaos that be both the world of the movie and the movie he be fully integrated story bearing visuals include some of the setup its baffling to me how everyone else would be so clearly inferior in execution this idea of have mask which be basically just headsock that form dynamic blot it be genius the other thing dear reader be something of personal quirk have fascination with orrery these be originally model of the solar system that be by gear and track novel machinery of different type suppose to model the movement of at least the planet as an student of model and abstraction these have historical significance for me and find that they have become sort of minor but very strong icon in film here we have one modern type it be almost perfect blend of superman crystal fort in the first movie and the device in contact we be suppose to believe that this be the perfect creation of perfect mind one that can see everything in how it work and can model it in such way that it control those force it be thus model of himself everything he know and his transit and container there be plot point where the lover emotion destroy be by simply exist but that be another story love the design of the thing its just marvelous these three dimensional model environment just thrill me want to recommend know just base on the stellated spaceship alone this be so much more laden with visual mysticism try to sit through this mess for the successful character and this orrery ted evaluation 2 of 3 have some interesting element

bizarre quasi funny fully predictable it one of these movie that you watch and ask why would one spend time and money to create it the realization be quite good special effect guy do great job make the pig interaction realistic the actor play well assume they be ask to play weirdos now the plot be 100 predictable from the very beginning of the movie you can even predict what would happen in the sequel of it if it ever make if there be any value of this movie it bring attention to the animal fate in our world and maybe doubtful bio gmo free food marketing line of some corporation but that it this could be do with 2min clip instead anyway might be good for some bizarre video fan
the only thing more stupid than this film be the artificially high imdb rating love good war film and fall into the be there do that category so would like to think my review be an accurate one imho have just watch this film on dvd can safely say that it be pile of rubbish there be no way can recommend this film to you it start off with me shout at the tv say you wouldn do that etc but soon realise that have bit of job experience would be hindrance so chilled bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off get nasty feeling that this film would be predictable dud be right there simply wasn any logic to the eod scene just know that the army team have some of the most patient insurgent ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so be leave scratch my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story be go the guy in the humvee be off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable asset in theatre out on jolly bump into some sas wannabe contractor the sniper scene be just so laughable it just make no sense at all and make me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really do test my patience it start with the contact right and go down hill fast if you have brit accent then you get shot but if you be part of the eod team then suddenly you be great shot and save the day then just as you think it be over it stretch on for an inexplicably long period without add anything to the story at all you be just leave watching and ask why hasn it end yet then we have the booze scene where they just hit each other for laugh another scene where you just want it to end it add nothing to the film then just as my life seem very dull the main star go outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene have ever watch it defy all logic and ability to write good storyline it be senseless and awful still don understand why they waste time on it then to watch him just jog through the busy street head back to camp have me roll on the floor with laughter pure comedy the sad fact be that this storyline be all over the show without really decide what it want to be think it be go to be stupid illogical eod scene but then it keep go off on tangent try to be something different but as hard as it try it just bore me to death all want be for it to end it be messy compilation of stupid scene mix into batch of stupid senseless action ish scene there be no way can recommend this maybe my work experience compromise the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn make sense the only thing more stupid than this film be the artificially high imdb rating which must be the 24 7 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as way of make everyone think it be good sorry folk it just ain not recommend it will just bore you

boring and contrive many people have tell me how devastated they be when they saw this movie but be just bore we talk about it and in the discussion that follow be accuse of not care about the victim of the holocaust one person even say be deny the holocaust happen and that sour me on the movie even more the fact be holocaust movie have insurance against criticism if you say the movie be waste of time someone might attribute your opinion to the holocaust itself don understand it but that weird emotional blackmail make me really uncomfortable with schindler list think liam neeson be horrible his acting be very stiff and unconvincing the use of hand hold camera and black and white cinematography should work but ultimately they amount to subtle special effect think the movie be emotionally flat as well watched each character go through the motion wonder when something unexpected would happen the horror of the holocaust be show in an almost clinical way don know just felt that this movie would feel less like bid for an oscar and more like personal film at the risk of be complete jerk ll give spielberg this advice do it again make another holocaust movie why not he finish kubrick ai kubrick have another movie in the planning stag holocaust film call aryan paper aka wartime lie hope he ll finish that kubrick movie too and create good holocaust film something can sink into and be surprise by something that feel much more personal
how do this movie start with 100 at rotten tomato be it scam spoiler for multiple movie inside in the middle of the movie the most emotional moment turn to the right in my row and noticed woman cry within just one minute that turn into several people herself include laugh out loud ve never experience this before in my life and think it summarize really well just how pointless and poorly do this movie be in the running man 1987 convict chase each other to death for entertainment of mass as far as remember they be all death row inmate and the justification be they be dead already so we might as well turn their sentence into entertainment at least one of the contestant be wrongly convict and fight the game itself in gladiator 2000 fight to death be base on historical fact in addition to that the main character be resign to death because his family be kill by ruthless psycho ruler he use the game which he be force into anyway to get to him now we have the hunger game group of completely innocent kid one of which be 10 or even young be force to fight to the death the ruling class be totally thrill while the poor subject watch the live broadcast in hope their kid would come out alive we be thrown right in the middle of that and the movie do not care to explain to the audience just how human society manage to degrade to such level as to make gladiator game seem like innocent play all we know there be war and in order to maintain peace we have these hunger game which mainly serve as intimidation by the ruling class but also as american idol type entertainment problem 1 the movie ignore the reality of human nature truth be strange than fiction but it be because fiction be oblige to stick to possibility mark twain hunger game attempt to break this rule and it either fail miserably or the audience be so desensitized that the movie creator do not feel the need to sweat base the fiction on human nature and reality be we really that desensitize judging by the praise for this movie it sure seem tat way no contestant seem depressed or try to escape the system which be what you would expect in such situation they switch from hope they don pick me to ok how do win this thing with equal emotion and mental adjustment to when change sock they even quickly start to enjoy the pre game show problem 2 even cruel game have rule that can be change in the middle of game hunger game simply do not have any rule in contrast to its own premise of iron fist control at one point katniss be force back into the game with deadly fireball on top of forest fire which she would have to escape to survive they be literally shoot to kill her and be think isn the forest fire enough to convince her to move on the fireball be completely irrational and unnecessary they only seem to place check mark in front of this movie have explosion then the control decide to change the rule from only one can win to two can win and then back to one can win once there be only two leave then it change that rule again to two can win because the game face an outcome with no winner this be probably do with the intention to intensify the suspense but it make the game itself weak and even more pointless than be willing to swallow this actually prevent me from forget about the impossibly fantastic premise and get into the game in addition to these 2 philosophical problem hunger game be cinematically mediocre at best it only do special effect well but nowadays that a give acting remind me of terra nova tv series in fact the entire movie kind of resemble an episode of terra nova there be only one main character in the movie and the rest be extras they do not really invest much in the development of support role even katniss be barely developed role the boy she be in love with play no role whatsoever the boy that have crush on her be an extra with crush know his character be support role but it be so poorly developed and act that refuse to accept him as one the makeup and costume be just plain bizarre again if the movie invest little bit in the history of how it all come to be to summarize will mention another peculiar thing about this move it feel like an open frankensteining from other movie this new creation feel like all these move cram together in limited amount of time act and setting terra nova tv series or star trek next generation feature film the capitol city alice in wonderland the control center avatar the arena and script gladiator and the run man with hint of truman show story development and dialogue the last airbender the shameless failure by nigh shyamalan
not very good movie never really like when movie get label define chapter of movie making or get name classic just cause it different sometimes it be sometimes it not clockwork orange be one of those which felt be garbage as movie pulp fiction be another sure it have speed weird character and slick line and story all over the place for me weird isn always good as there be no red line no real story to follow don even find this movie very cool even though it might be worth watch just cause it like no other movie but the story the substance of the movie be very thin tarantino be for me not very good director sure some of his movie be ok but mostly he overdo it on many occasion which make it hard to take them seriously it no real drama no action no thriller just something put in blender it seem if want true story movie with substance and an experience richer after ward this be not movie to get anywhere near

it not the piece it the drive great creative insight be to take thing that we think of as separate and contain like 39 art 39 39 genius 39 or 39 idea 39 and realize how they be fluid and inter dependent condition by factor this be not to expose anything as little deconstruction for its sake it 39 to show them to be doable that road lead up to them it 39 also one of the three main area of buddhist practice br br one obvious way to do this would be to take this and note the many influence this have be do to death already every bit that tarantino hop to keep packed or want us to find out have be lay out in the open but this just give us someone genius or not who steal from the right place br br another way would be to see that it doesn 39 work the same way as it do when new because it have all be make ordinary by slavish follower gobble up by familiarity the moment of simple banter away from plot the fooling round with edge of story without show the main center piece bleed on floor follow mr blonde outside to pick up can of gasoline tarantino be probably proud that he be be quot real quot make radical break from bruckheimer 39 hollywood br br it 39 bit and piece of godard cassavetes altman and others to see it now show how theatric it be not quot real quot at all the least theatric acting be by the bound cop roth be just woeful it 39 the killer with the violence and gum pop visuals as typical to see as the killer be typical without them in its own time br br me 39 like to settle for something else that bring us to real influence of more elusive kind br br everything you see here be come from young guy who be at the best possible time in his life lift from obscurity and everything be begin to click into place beyond expectation can you imagine how giddy he must have be to hear yes from keitel and here 39 a check br br it 39 tarantino come in from the outside as someone young and eager to make dream come true it 39 burst with energy but discipline kept in check by not have everything at your disposal be the new kid on set it would be nothing without this energy br br and it 39 tarantino be root in his own world as he bring the dream alive suburban la none of the story have any outlet into real life it 39 all bounce around movie cutout gangster show up before heist for breakfast in tuxedo but it 39 the video clerk 39 imagination cruise through his own world he have guy exchange banter about stripper from palos verdes roth improvise story about buy weed the summer of 39 86 br br so this be the most vibrant sense get someone make it not have to prove himself because he 39 there make movie with name actor around town relaxed and fire up at the same time see if you can feel this off his screen presence and what stark difference from his surly presence now br br his next one would be the apogee of this path it can also be trace to the 30 year old who have fly himself to amsterdam to write away from home like hemingway live the dream

start out great kinda go downhill overtime season 1 and 2 be great season 3 be ok although my opinion on that particular season be bit high than the general consensus but season 4 take major drop in overall quality the episode be just all over the place constantly break flow and either go too fast or too slow for example season 4 episode 7 felt like it keep start over do something completely different every time it start gain any real momentum they all just didnt feel like fluid story to me this be seriously start to feel like the simpson where every episode feel like it be write with game of round robin or something along those line really hope the writer can get this show back on track soon because do think they can do it the show isnt too far go they just need to put some effort into it

good but over rat good action drama movie that deliver all the basic the genre demand very good performance by russell crowe and sexy kim bassinger tag too long and drag due to too much dialogue but still manage to compensate with good action sequence nothing spectacular or original here so do not expect too much due to many genre fan over rating this movie it certainly no classic the story demand less hollywood end than the one present here only for noir action drama fan police crime action drama movie and big fan of the lead actor
highly overrate but still good good prison movie whose cult of fan have make it into something so much more than it be great movie ever make get real it not even the great prison movie ever make hell it not even the best movie release in 1994 it predictable and borrow heavily from decade of prison movie clichxe9s it also nowhere near as deep as its staunch admirer would have you believe still it an entertaining movie nice direction from frank darabont morgan freeman be the highlight with solid support cast tim robbins however be borderline ridiculous at time with his cartoonish facial expression and silly stare off into the distance moment he so far beneath freeman as an actor it sad with normal movie like this would focus more on the positive do give it 7 after all unfortunately it be easily the most overrated movie of all time on imdb for sure and as such the balance of positive to negative be out of whack 7
pretty typical dystopian film this film be base on graphic novel which admit haven read it not bad at all but the setting be quite generic dystopia which make the film bit typical for the genre it incredibly unsubtle about its message and the main character be mouthpiece but it still good film
bore pedantic 5 minute worth of real material incredibly boring and simplistic plot pedantic performance particularly by bullock whiz bang cgi be nothing more than porn to the oscar voting crowd whatever hollywood produce they have to vote for they have to vote for something and give an oscar to something however shallow uninteresting boring pedantic etc too bad clooney waste his time on this one and the plot would have be much well if bullock character would have buy it within the first 5 minute in fact the whole movie should have be 5 minute long that pretty much how much real material the film have 5 minute the end boring stupid pedantic move on

total rubbish this film be what happen when you get bunch of creepy japanese animator with too much time on their hand this film be utterly pointless girl wanders around compound full of ghost look for her parent avoid alot of gruemsome muck the main charachter have no character she go from one weird place to another hardly comment or express anything outside of the stereotypical eye thing japanamation like to do it full of monster and ghost do vague and unusual thing try to be scary m not for be spoon fed mean in nice bite size package but this make brazil seem focus and straightforward the film like many of the charachters just wanders and lingers around like an alztimer patient try to find his way out of run down funhouse visually it be please but so be my blender if you want to see bunch of well illustrated weird stuff with no point whatsoever then this be the film for you
an astonishing rarity the curious case of benjamin button be film unlike any ve ever see and probably ever will true epic that leave me utterly speechless it accomplish so much through such simplicity everything be top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performance down to the magical score the film demand you to feel not only for the death we witness but for the incredible life we discover it pray on the obvious morality issue we all deal with but also dangle the idea in front of us that everyone go through the same joy and grievance just not in the same way this be momentous tale that deserve nothing less than the title of brilliance this visually and emotionally rich movie recall the life of very peculiar man bear in the early 20th century who age backwards his tale unfolds through diary read by the daughter of his love daisy throughout life he go through the same thing we do grow up and eventually grow old he a thoughtful observer discover life from all different angle but it be not his life that make him unique his love be what make him special he spend lifetime try to understand how his love for daisy work and still only get few incredible year really love her as their life tell us the year of frustration and hardship be all worth it if only for few moment of happiness the direction in the film be almost flawless hopefully benjamin button will garner david fincher the recognition he deserve he wind this clock so well and with such grace that the movie have this undeniable flow that be enjoyable from start to finish at nearly 3 hour there be not minute waste every shot be jaw drop and while some will find issue with the time it be use wisely the acting be also thing of wonder this be by far brad pitt best performance he be so believable and realistic throughout his nuance be spot on and despite the heavy use of make up and cgi use to portray his character it be pitt who make benjamin that much more curious leave the theater astonish that some one could review this movie badly it be an extremely graceful depiction of life love and the thing we lose after so much anticipation be certainly not disappointed this movie be probably not for everyone though it not your average drama that spoon feed it audience their emotion it be something of awe and astonishment an absolute gem what make our life memorable be the moment we never seem to grasp long enough before let go life in itself be indeed very very curious and benjamin button be no le of wonder
good but not that good the incredibles another pixar film big budget big name big special effect etc this film be fun for all the family enjoy the mix of childish and adult humour that pixar do so well however due to the hype surround this film and the obsession which seem to go with it feel compel to inject some reason the incredibles be good but not that good it have reasonable script predictable storyline do not really take computer animation to new limit and while funny do not compare with the like of shrek toy story monster inc or find nemo let alone host of other superior animate film commercially unrecognised this film be one more pixar film to add to grow list of adequate fun family film which despite be enjoyable really do add little to film as whole would recommend this film to all who want bit of an escape and do not feel like watch anything intellectually or emotionally stimulating in summary fun for all the family but should never be consider true great
not so impressive thought either it might be funny movie or some serious stuff kind of story but at end it waste of time few event do give me trill but they didn end up as expect thank you
stunk like skunk this movie be not only frustrate but continue in the cheap horror category to rely on character with sub zero iq act wasn bad but plot be so agonizingly reliant on stupidity that be leave frustrated this be great attempt at horror by blossom writer but fell far short of frighten interesting or satisfy it should be note that due to ten line minimum for review must go into painful detail about how this movie fail to live up to horror movie expectation include attempt to understand why stupidity play such role in modern attempt to be frighten this film and few others like it scream freddy versus jason mercy utilize protagonist that couldn wipe their own butt without direction how on earth can movie be frighten if you re constantly imagine the character demise by their own hand in fashion that would make charles darwin shudder at the state of modern man genetics if you be look for horror movie that win leave you unsatisfied and represent similar horror feel go watch babadook the character in this movie never grow up from their childhood and ve meet 2nd grader who would have end this story in about thirty minute because single original and useful thought would have do the trick
totally underwhelmed this be in my opinion the most over rat film of all time sure there be some snappy dialogue here and there and tarantino have good ear for music but none of this warrant the gush praise heap upon this movie nor the godlike status bestow upon tarantino himself it over stylise over loud over acted sorry samuel tim john uma bruce and the non linear narrative so favour by the director simply doesn work but it fashionable so it popular by the way this be one of the few film where ve actually see people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end so guess m not the only one who didn like it
small doll pose small threat when it come out child play be highly original and scary in that you wouldn look the same way at doll again but then don intend to look at doll again and by now the premise of doll threaten people with pretty small stabbing object be hardly terrify the shock therapy scene be pretty painful to watch but all in all find it well when first saw it then do now still give it merit for originality and good voice over by brad dourif m not even give review of the sequel they re too dire to waste word on
it suck contain spoiler what be big deal about his borefest a confidential be probably the most overrated movie of the 1990s the story be confuse and boring and so be the character just because the character talk in low voice and the story be complex doesn make it intelligent or good all the character be shallow and some of them act like they don want to be there espicially kevin spacy and kim basinger in the end there be your cliched shootout where all the good guy win and bad guy die russell crowe get shot three time even in the face and still survive also in the end the pretty girl kiss the hero and this be suppose to be one of the best movie of the past decade
it hard to find fault this be epic the acting be amaze near perfect write the actor who play henry timothee should be big star great presence take the time to watch this m glad do high quality stuff
positive surprise didn have high hope when go to see this immediately though be captivate by the beautiful visual style in both the landscape architecture and especially the cool technology hud and touch screen etc it be simply stun as for the plot it wasn too original as such but love the husband and housewife interplay between jack and victoria it be somehow cozy to see single couple alone in vast rough environment together but separate there be distinct air of long about the whole setup one of the most memorable and silly moment be when jack ride his motorcycle for long stretch of desert seem kinda pointless for him to have to use motorcycle but it be nice scene otherwise which bring me to the music love it give the movie 8 10 for the visual style music and the bitter sweet chemistry between the main character
i love heartbreaker pussy power be this films message and sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt be two hot actress who team up to create max and page conners seductively sexy mother daughter con team who deviously lure men into marriage and then leave them break hearted and break heartbreaker be delightful comedy that prove how deceitful clever woman can be as weaver demonstrate as the gorgeous and allure max conners who target wealthy gentleman walk them down the aisle and then empty their pocket through divorce when she discover that they have eye for other woman but the amusing thing about this film be that the other woman be max sexy young daughter page and she can turn just as many head as her mother unknown to her husband page be train to seduce them help her mother get out of her new marriage with few buck in her pocket and the freedom to put more foolish men under her spell ray liotta be hilarious as dean and vinnie stagliano the ex husband of max who be bitter and desperate for revenge when he discover how much of bitch his ex wife be meanwhile page believe she could just as easily lure men into marriage like her mother and set her sight on jack withroe jason lee bar owner who fall in love with her unaware of her game but the plot really get interesting when we learn that page have heart and be in love with jack the end be excite enjoyable and romantic heartbreaker be fun film for the female with plenty of eye candy and cleavage for the male
a brilliant move epic lot of people see and love king kong for it amaze special effect and visual design they be mind bogglingly good and the film be an incredibly exciting blockbuster but what elevate it above the usual mindless entertainment be that jackson understand that no matter how much be put into the special effect at the end of the day what matter most be the write story and character jackson push all the action back until an hour in the film take time to establish the character before throw them into it he do this beautiful and despite the lack of action it be very engaging and make the film seem like an improvement on the original film because it give us reason to care later on this also build suspense make kong entrance even more effective kong himself be amaze the cgi work on him be unlike anything the movie have ever see kong performance for lack of good movie be what make this movie truly amaze it incredibly realistic and the relationship between him and ann be completely convincing and make for the best scene in the movie jackson make it as truly involve as any ever see between two human actor as exciting and action pack as it be by the end the most interesting part of the film be the relationship and growth of the character and the final scene be actually an action setpiece that manage to be truly move at the same time
immensely entertain intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best film ever make write review of the matrix be very hard thing for me to do because this film mean lot to me and therefore want to do the film justice by write good review to tell the truth the first time saw the film be enamor by the effect remember think to myself that this be one of the most visually stunning film have ever see in my life also have always be comic book fan and fan of film that be large than life the transitional element of the story be very appeal to me and this probably heighten my enjoyment of the film very much it wasn until some time later and after have see the film few time more that start to think about the film recognize the christian element quite quickly but it wasn until write an actual 15 page essay on the film that tap into some of the philosophical and religious element and that make me appreciate the film even more won say that have recognize all element because the film be quite literally pack with them act wise the film work excellently win say that there aren any issue because there be but overall the acting be pretty flawless keanu reef play the main character neo or thomas anderson and while he be not the perfect actor think he do pretty good job in the matrix and the sequel he doesn have the long of line which be probably deliberate choice from the director and it work because this give him good opportunity to work on posture and facial expression and must say that overall his body language be very good very clear and well defined laurence fishbourne play neo mentor morpheus and he do an excellent job of it his line flow with certain confidence and style that make his character somewhat unique and interesting carrie anne moss do good job as well and succeed in look both cool and sexy in her leather outfit joe pantoliano critically underrated actor do brilliant job of bring his character cypher to life can say much about him because his character be pretty essential to the plot and certainly don wan to spoil it for anyone gloria foster appear in relatively small role that will have great significance in the following film and she do very good job the best acting be provide by hugo weave however in his portrayal of agent smith it be really something to watch him act out the change in his character agent smith gain some human trait like anger sense of dread hate and eventually even sly sense of humor mostly in the sequel two thumb way up to weave who have create one of the fine screen villain of all time effect wise the film be simply stunning and it deservedly be award the oscar for best effect and be regrettably cheat out of nomination in the best film category ahead of even star war the reason that think the matrix deserve the oscar for best effect be simply that the effect in the matrix be more innovative than the one in star war just take look at how many time the effect have be spoof and you ll probably agree the effect also help in the symbolism of the film and in create very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one see in blade runner and this work brilliantly the film look beautiful at all time and today 6 year later my god have it already be 6 year the effect still hold their ground against new science fiction film add the effect to the brilliant editing and you have visual masterpiece on your hand very well do the reason that think the matrix be more reviewable than pretty much any other film be the story and the philosophical and religious element of the story because with every view catch something didn see the previous time watch it without spoil the film think can mention few of the more obvious element obviously the film draw on the messiah myth as neo be clear reference to jesus with the analogy of his name neo one as in the one but also hide in his other name thomas anderson the first part of his last name anderson come from the greek andros meaning man and combine this with the second part of his last name son and add little creativity you will come up with the combination son of man which be title jesus come up with about himself also the first time we meet neo man call him and quote you re my saviour man my own personal jesus christ it doesn get any more obvious than that aside from the christianic element the film also get its inspiration from budhism gnosticism gnosis knowledge but be also inspire by plato and his analogy of the cave and jean baudrillard essay simulacrum and simulation explain these element would make this review go on forever so aside from mention them will not comment on them far to all the people who doubt the profound nature of the matrix can only give one advice free your mind and watch the film again you win regret it if have to choose favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either the matrix obviously don expect people to agree but if they do thats great or the lord of the ring the return of the king and recommend it to all fan of sci fi and people who like philosophy 10 10 on my top 3 of best film
a really worthwhile action flick faster do not try to be anything it not it be fast paced action flick with plausible performance from all round ve always like thornton as he be very good at play drug out low life he be perfect for this role forget thornton though nothing fit well than the role the rock play cold mean man with big muscle look for revenge that exactly who the rock be and could easily say there be no good man for the job oliver jackson cohen as the hit man also play decent role and really like the addition to his role of be challenge maybe m not express myself very well but what think m try to say be that fast didn feel corny in any scene like most action film go waaaaaay overboard or some try to mix too much drama into it when it suppose to be an action flick didn feel any negative element like that linger around in fast it solid action that believable and although it do have some drama in it it weave in quite well but in any case the action overpowers any other element the movie may have to offer throughout the movie be actually grip with tension and it also have good twist at the end though the smarter movie goer would probably pick it up early on really can say anything bad about this film besides the fact it just an action movie and that not negative because that what it set out to be and that what it be no academy performances no sensational script but much good than other action movie because like say no corny scenes all plausible no dodgy romance scene by the way without give too much of spoiler also really enjoy the fact how faster develop scenario where expect at least one character life to turn to ruin but instead an unexpected but easily believable resolution be find everyone get what they deserve which be great and also get what deserve enjoyable action by the way this movie no where near deserve 6 7 rating on imdb know action title aren give too much credit but faster deserves to be at least 7 probably about 7 2
fun movie worth see this be good than be expect the location and set be awesome contain some scare and some laughs lot of hater on this one m constantly amuse by how many people seem to think that they re the successor to roger ebert try go to movie for fun time instead of look for way to rip it new one in your lame as review
the time of my life this be great feel good movie everytime watch it fall in love with the character all over again especially johnny this may be more of girl flick than guy movie but think it a great movie it may not be one of the most original plot in the world but the love story be simple and sweet and the dancing be phenomenal make me wan na get up and do the mambo everytime watch it so if you re in the mood for love story with bit of sas and some great choreography check out dirty dancing
iris the quality of the show degrade over time to the point that it become so boring iris isn fit for her role and she so irritate
delightful underrated film this be one of those underrated film which have limit release be not really promote and in my opinion be dismiss by some as low budget shallow flop because they really do not get the writer intent michael douglas give an excellent performance and it be say that he immediately want to do the film after read the script sure it be lighthearted feel good story but think lot of people simply miss the dramatic undertone and the depth though not one of my favorite actress evan rachel wood somehow manage to capture the character of an exasperate but love daughter who have have to grow up and take responsibility too quickly because of her absentee parent her young life skip over any fun year and immediately enter the survival mode in which many low wage adult worker live because of lack of education or opportunity due to absentee parent or the socioeconomic situation of their family enter her mentally ill quirky father who at first she see as just another burden over time she realize he be sincere idealist struggle desperately to make up for his past mistake her love bring reluctant willingness to humor him and join in his quixotic search and end with an eye opening realization about her father life and the nature of idealism if you decide to watch it avoid all possible spoiler
an honest review this be rat and it hard to believe but let face it scary movie just aren that scary anymore not that many of them ever be and even then few have actually provide the constant nightmare of the exorcist but the conjure 2 feel like it go for the pg scar to not lose audience the potential be there but the director be fly with one hand on the chicken switch and pull out of everything that not bad than jump scare we have the potential for an actual psychologically thrill horror story here but its wasted potential ultimately like every other horror movie make of late it seem afraid to actually frighten people still it good than the torture porn on the market
dorm room trauma one of the most horrible memory have of college be that in our dorm they seem to run this movie 24 7 would go down to the tv lounge to watch something and it would be fill with my peer pajama clad and munch on popcorn and clutch their box of kleenex it be constant rotation of pretty woman dirty dancing and can buy me love have night terror because of it hat the movie hate patrick swayze think it go back to his promotion of the movie as have more substance than footloose or flashdance like say that cotton candy have more substance than marshmellows have to give this movie 1 to counteract the average of 5 on this film would normally have give it 3 but the majority of you folks leave me no choice don know that this movie inspire anger in me but that time of your life song make me cower and whimper curl up in fetal position the big clue that this movie lack anything interest it wasn in black and white
not great but somehow intriguing there be something here with the female lead have this perfect life she always want after the bad life possible beginning as child prostitute and wind up with eric robert but her background make it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroy it in the end it sound weird but like the position dean cain be in at the end and the choice he make he can hurt her because he love her and she the mother of his child think the time frame make it clear it his child and not his brother but at the same he can forgive her for all she do sleep with his brother which show the love and obligation he felt be pretty much one way and then be part of his death in good hand this would have be well movie but for something catch on late night cable it not bad
worth watch if you re bore it a thin line between self aware and self involve and it one the movie tread uncertainly the sometimes vague adaptation may leave casual viewer wonder just what be so terrible about robert marriage to dilettantish but devote billy crudup or how anyone can afford to take off an entire year and simply travel the world for spiritual story there seem to be an awful lot of self indulgence and privilege be it eat pray spend maybe just bit but at least the pensione roberts stay in be run down and while she seem to have fit lot of clothes into her limited luggage there no obvious fashion porn this spiritual quest isn the razor edge sadly but neither be it sex and the city 3 robert flat worn sandal almost function as silent rebuke to sarah jessica parker manolos the best part of the film though be clearly the eat and the love the first third be virtual advertisement for rome and its food full of gorgeous cinematography by robert richardson regular recent collaborator with martin scorsese and quentin tarantino the ancient ruin never look more alive the lifestyle never more irresistible and in the third and final section at last the movie move into the romantic genre it have be avoid and its audience have be wish for all along bardem show up as an ex pat brazilian sambas start on the soundtrack and finally he take robert hand and murmur it time and throughout the theater woman murmur it sure be bardem be effortlessly charming and nicely command in what in romantic drama be typically thankless objectified role in fact all the male performer be very good richard jenkins have standout scene as fellow seeker in india even robert who so often project mere impatient superiority rediscovers an on screen vulnerability of course some on screen selflessness would have help here too find meaning by work in some homegrown charity perhaps instead of work on her own bliss in some far flung country but then this film be gilbert book and gilbert book be her life
plagerised crap this movie be such complete and utter rip off of battle royale real cult classic from japan the author of the hunger game should be strip of every cent they make from this movie and the book poor act boring story and the costume be horrible they actually make the beautiful elizabeth bank revolt to the point that it take away from what movie there be actually to watch only reason didn give it 1 10 be because jennifer lawrence be pretty good d rather watch battle royale and battle royale ii hundred time that watch this again even the following book movie be rip from battle royale ii where the kid revolt against the system

hole in the oh nut not too large to jump shark the simpson tv show be best in the business for plot twist outrageous reversal whiplash satire and one liner make the best episode as satisfy as many great film top that or even match it with the long awaited movie be always go to be challenge be entertain but truthfully no more than middle episode of the series the richness of the springfield lore and background character be sideline to focus on the family itself with too much homer in particular yes never think d say that but it true we love the simpson for its frenetic pace it clear here the writer struggle with the structure for long format possibly robert altman nashville approach would have work well or maybe something like it a mad mad mad mad world allow us to see the great range of character and support strong over arch story the decision to focus almost exclusively on the family itself bring out the tv show occasional tendency towards sentimentality colin lisa go nowhere flanders bart didn buy it for second oval office scene rainer wolfcastle would have be funny or gwb pass the buck that bit edgier this isn mean to be the walton more playfulness with the film format itself would have be welcome too the opening itchy scratchy sequence and homer response be great but as it turn out too little too early for the film seldom venture from the straight narrow thereafter maybe terry gilliam to direct simpson ii early rumour some time ago know suggest the simpson movie would be the final word on the show but the commitment to another couple of season mean the film lose that seat of the pant anything could happen edge really believe the team should have one last hurrah with final movie just don try to jump the shark blast it out of the water get radical guy that when you re at your best
tarantino first best have start and stop this film many time before actually sit down and watch it all the way through after sit through it can 39 stop think about it br br the film be compose beautifully instead of simple plot line it be break up and rearrange make the audience work until the end the music and character transition be perfect br br tarantino do great job make the character true to the people portray them mr pink mr blonde and mr white could have not be more perfect to their character the sheer fact that hat and love the various character almost to point of them be real be feat in it of itself br br felt that the profanity be bit much and it may be necessary to the plot and emotion but at time it be bit overbearing br br overall though be very impressed by the rawness of the story and how developed all of the character be amaze

it really not that bad if you watch it without bias really 3 8 and 22 give it 1 and 4 rotten on rt that be just hype hate watch the movie last week on tv know nothing about it do think it be good movie no but it certainly wasn terrible either it be just an okay movie like there be so many but this one in the quite rare fantasy genre it have bad part in act fake scenery and generic story but it also have decent to even good part in the same area and the bad part be not as bad as people here will have you believe there be not much wrong with the fighting scene good fun thought and camera and directing be certainly not great but ve see much bad all in all it a somewhat generic fantasy movie that do some thing bad and some thing good quite enjoyed watch it and be surprise to see all the hate in review sense lot of bias though people seem to love to hate this director but don know him so as completely neutral unbiased viewer rate this film 6 5 10 quite alright for when you feel like watch fantasy flick some night
incredible movie with fantastic act true masterpiece shoot in very beautiful village the story be spectacular the star act like it be truly scenario beautiful
wish it be as good as they say it be go into this movie with high expectation come out feel like d just sit through long funeral for someone didn know on hot and humid day massive spoiler basically describe the whole movie in detail the movie start out great with little action scene and little bit about the main character leonardo dicaprio and his son after that with very little else about the story or anything to tie viewer into it dicaprio be maul by bear because for some reason he in the forest alone after just be raid and destroy by some indian tribe who be look for some random girl maybe m miss something but that about all take from the beginning of the movie so the rest of the american come and rescue dicaprio from underneath the bear he just kill after it nearly maul him to death and for some reason he survive even though in reality he probably have lose enough blood at that point to kill three people the rest of the middle of the movie be watch dicaprio breathe heavily and crawl around the forest floor with some cinematic shot of snow and listen to tom hardy attempt to cover up his terrible accent by speak as low as possible oh and do mention dicaprio have an indian kid yea so he have kid the kid mom and tribe be massacre by american or french or something like that and dicaprio be really close to the kid and vice versa yes it the predictable average story of revenge so tom hardy kill dicaprio kid because the kid doesn want him to kill his father then they leave dicaprio behind to die but guess what the main character didn die wow didn see that one come so he regain strength get some support from some random indian dude who also lose his family but to another tribe and then some french dude who have the girl the other tribe be look for find and kill the other indian dude but don see dicaprio apparently even though he be in giant wood shelter with fire go dicaprio become hero and save the girl kill some french dude and ride off to get his revenge and you know what happen next he get his revenge wow wee what an adventure movie end with the indian tribe who get their girl back finish off tom hardy with hatchet or knife and they walk past leo and leave him alone seriously though don understand the hype around this movie it be oscar bait because 90 of the movie be leo breathe heavy acting as injured and in pain as possible crawl around grunt and moan the only good thing about the movie be the cinematic shot and scene but nothing else insanely bland and generic story with good set actually like most of dicaprio movie and think he should ve have an oscar long time ago but don feel it should be for this movie
strictly average like anna faris and her movie but this one be particularly average there some funny moment but limit the male lead be old and have no chemistry with faris he be dull in many part they should have include more funny part as the movie be begin to go little downhill past halfway the inclusion of spanish or foreign language disjoint the movie in part and felt like be watch totally different movie strictly average with some light moment
a well do send off to decent film series so that be the hobbit the battle of the five army the final film in peter jackson six film middle earth saga this may just be jackson most ambitious film yet it have to work as standalone film it have to be the final part of trilogy and it have to be the bridge between the hobbit and the lord of the ring film ambitious let me state for the record that m an enormous fan of the lord of the ring film consider them to be the best trilogy of all time however didn really have that same vibe with the hobbit film admit when heard they would begin make more middle earth film be excite the thought of return to middle earth be exhilarate then in december 2012 the first hobbit film have its release be disappoint it may have be because didn know what to expect but it certainly wasn what have hop it would be there be too much goofy humor and it be close to put me to sleep at time come december 2013 the desolation of smaug be release look back think that this film be intend to split audience this film deviate so much from its source material that at time forget what be watch suddenly there be dwarf elf love story suddenly thorin company of dwarf split up suddenly they re fight smaug and then the film end now here we be in 2014 with the conclusion to the hobbit film the battle of the five army this film literally start off where desolation leave off with smaug destroy lake town breathtaking sequence beautiful visuals remind us that thorin action will bring some devastating consequence however the sequence lose me bit by cut away to the master of lake town and alfrid who guess be mean to be comic relief but end up wish they die not because didn like their character but because think they be so annoying and distract from the overall experience after very lord of the ring esque recovery scene we meet bilbo and thorin half company of dwarf at erebor and you can tell thorin have change he become sick with the aptly name dragon sickness and bilbo can tell that something isn quite right about him little do they know that azog who be like the evil thing ever be march towards erebor as well as the elvenking mr fabulous thranduil be also move towards erebor result in literal clash of the titan what we end up with be an enormous battle so large in fact that it share title with the film and now be also when peter jackson display his quality and fault as film director he manage to make his battle very intimate despite the chaos that you see on the screen however he have show particular love for goofy stuff and after three film he finally almost get it there still be goofiness for people who crave that but for the rest of us it come off as dumb excuse for cheap laugh but damn this film have lot of cgi and some of it doesn even look finish some sequence look like video game cutscenes at best and at point have to take off my 3d glass because have no idea what be happen note to self never see 3d film again however all thing must come to an end and in this film there be so many case that be leave unsolved almost to the point where it baffle me we re introduce to thorin cousin daín ironfoot who m pretty sure be cgi version of billy connolly suddenly he go and we re leave wonder where he go and we never see what happen to them again same thing happen to beorn tauriel bard and sigh alfrid just to mention few that this film main problem it open too many door without shut them do that analogy make sense there almost no resolution to any of the character except for bilbo masterfully portray by martin freeman by the way for film series call the hobbit he doesn appear nearly enough m look at you tauriel get out of the frame in conclusion this be worthy final installment in the hobbit trilogy and film consider to be the best of the three pro great act well direct battle sequence howard shore need say more good visuals con lack of resolution obnoxious character too much cgi some cheesy moment all in all fine holiday film if you enjoy the previous hobbit you ll like this one
oscar worthy script definitely well write in part act be what be to be expect from top notch cast drag out scene to hit 2 1 2 hour mark without much really happen to fill in the gap felt way longer this second watch and sadly very average
amaze concept the old guard 2020 be first very pleasant surprise in cinema in this disastrous 2020 do not read of heard any synopsis prior watch the old guard 2020 and boy do this movie surprise me simply love the concept when be reveal for me the concept itself carry this movie wasn that blow away by action in this movie which be pretty good by itself but like the idea so much that would love for character to simply sit and just talk and teorise about the main concept which win spoil the old guard be like the highlander meet the man from earth but with much big budget overall like the concept of this movie very much would love to see sequel would love to see what happen to the character which be throw to the bottom of the sea the old guard be one of the more original film in 2020 and one of my very favorite
disturb as movie it bore as story it glorify questionable man and deal with sensitive theme without any delicacy the benefit of the doubt about the morality of kevorkian action be go with patient number 1 no way she be terminal she be just diagnose with alzhaimer and still very fine secondly the closing speech of the judge be all you have to know about how law work in civil society this movie be despicable piece of political propaganda rather than well rounded presentation of the theme of euthanasia
want good western this pale in comparison to longmire the acting be okay kevin costner still have it but it not all that good
its demo for visual effect peter jackson be great director and if you don know him just remember lord of the ring it be the great movie ever be make but here the point be completely different it be remake of well know story think that there be no one who like watch movie didn see the 1933 or 1967 production of the story so the point here be not an evaluation of the story enter the cinema to watch peter jackson view to the story the first 30 min of the movie be completely pointless and can simply be remove without affect the movie at all just cut em and don change anything else be helpless during this period but be bore and wait for the actor to start their journey to the kong island from this point win discuss the story we already know what be go to happen so peter be focus on show how every thing happen felt that the script be tailor to include as many animated object and visual effect even if the see doesn need all these effect and in the same time many of the shot be totally obvious to be unreal like the dinosaur chase and the fight of kong and the dinosaur peter use the technique of shake the camera lot shake the camera so the watcher become unable to see what be really go on the bug scene be fine and the kong in theater be fine too but once we reach the part with the airplane attack him it become another visual effect demo no more comment the sound be great and the sound effect be awesome actually these effect be the main reason for me to enjoy the film if you plan to watch the movie here be what to do if you love watch computer graphic go ahead if not watch the 1976 edition you will like it more if you end up in the cinema don forget to sleep for first 30 min

merica the film as whole be utter face numb drivel it couldn be anymore up it own backside it play up to the american ideal so much that it felt like some kind of recruitment ad for the us military the character each and everyone be shallow cliché see many review claim the film to be the next die hard it not die hard be responsible for many action film clichés but what make die hard special for me at least be the reluctant hero who be out of his depth but push and quip his way to victory the writing be be hammy despite the pretty cool premise the film be mar by seemingly inept good guy who manage to some how let huge plane fly right over the most important building in the us this be then follow by highly train special agent run into the line of fire and government official make continually bad decision poor film
light enjoyable fare that prove animation be still on top when it come to produce well round realise and consistently entertaining movie be it just me or have there be no really awful animated film from the stable of the top studio like pixar and dreamworks etc the movie industry as whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that go into these movie both suit and audience be sure to benefit if that ever happen long may the tradition of quality animate movie be say actually buy ticket for this last night after find to my dismay that another premiere from hell be already sell out by the time arrive these be certainly two distinctly different film in theme be slightly grouchy because couple with that minor disappointment d have an argument with friend on the way over to the theatre and be now proceed solo wouldn say that monster inc make me glad miss from hell but still get solidly entertaining film for my money just hope don miss ocean 11 next week for every plus point to the movie can also think of criticism but on the whole the good point just outweigh the bad the setup may be little too complicate for young audience and the support cast of voice be waste there be definitely not enough steve buscemi whose bad guy just seem like an afterthought to all the keystone cop esque caper of try to get boo out of monstropolis the script be pitch at much young level than toy story be and so as result adult may be bowl over by the animation but slightly starve in the belly laugh department that say there be still couple of moment guarantee to have old patron guffaw heartily just not enough for my like even without laughter the story be still divert and inventive enough to fix your attention satisfactorily the movie really come into its own when the kid be introduce as thereafter the action rarely pause for breath good as the voice talent of goodman and crystal be it be undoubtedly youngster mary gibbs who inadvertently steal the show her cute gurgle and shriek be enough to put smile on most people face and warm their heart the job the team do on collect all her voice sample for the finished movie be nothing short of amaze indeed just like the animation achievement be as well goodman excels in his voice act make sulley truly memorable character the animation be wonderful and at time will make you unable to do anything else but gawp technique in this arena seem to be move at lightspeed and in just few year will make the graphic see in toy story seem unremarkable just for this factor alone monster inc deserves to be see but the likeable if not always best use cast and the imaginative plot add an extra dimension that make it worth your time nowhere near toy story beater for sheer polish and appeal to all age but commendable effort nonetheless well do altogether now put that thing back where it come from or so help me
i don have the motivation to keep watch the first fight scene be too long battle scene or an action scene be bore to watch unless you know why the main character be fight moreover these scene be shoot in close proximity with wide angle camera it a very realistic shot but if it use in the first scene the director look drunk and the audience get cold foot secondly the name of the antagonist be not good when think the atmosphere of the film resemble aguirre wrath of god be shock to listen the name of the protagonist the title of herzog other masterpiece this be one of those place where the director be drink on his own and that why he do this next there a bear this bear doesn bite at all and doesn attack with its claw the film have be shoot in such way that you can see how it do this be where the director incompetence come into play the bear bite so he have to prepare doll to show the bear biting and he have to deal with it well so that you wouldn find out that he wasn bite as the story progress the antagonist become clear and clear but this antagonist be too small fish character the antagonist need to be bit big and more human to be interest it make me feel feed up that the story be go to progress to defeat this antagonist overall would have to say that this be low level work

the most important movie of all time who would have think that an experimental director would have have to resurrect classic hero story tell well that where they be in the 70s and lucas do it with such perfection he do his research and he care and most importantly he be trust to make the movie that he want new hope be the great success story in hollywood not only because it change movie and make lot of money and continue to touch people to this day but because nobody believe in lucas alan ladd jr at fox and mark hamill be about it not only that but this production have everything go wrong with it it be literally against all odds from everyone include the studio then it be smash hit of unheard of proportion once teacher of mine ask if movie be more than movie and he say look at star war yes they be and he wasn even fan this be more than movie because it speak to people in way that can be describe they ve try but no one can it something that you feel because lucas update the hero myth he take what work in story from all around the world since the dawn of time and make it his own and he really good at make movie think really the big contribution to movie overall isn the special effect and the return to good versus evil storytelling it that lucas really care about how quickly the movie flow he doesn keep thing that hang and everything be always move movie become much faster after this because lucas really focus on the pace and feel out of all 6 movie this one can stand alone as it be intend well not intend but it be equip to be one movie as fan this be always the worse of the original 3 because the next two be good but when get old and saw the movie proceeding this understood it after the french connection and dirty harry and the godfather and so many others which be all good but finally saw why lucas want to make this and the movie click for me and love it much more fun simple fast and good v evil this movie really do everything right every time watch it m excited and laugh at every joke it an uplifting movie that many have try to duplicate and be either too much of this or that we talk about the influence for this but that not what make it so good it lucas while theme and motif be take from other source there really isn anything that be directly from something else he take those idea and make them his own he know how far to go where to stop because lucas have always show restraint wonder what people will think when they watch them in episode order where the emperor where yoda who be all these new people why be vader hardly in it anakin be now pathetic he always be but we never realize it grand moff tarkin be his bos vader take order from him he be just do what the emperor tell him to do it funny that he become such pop culture icon of evil that be never the intention love james earl jones voice in this one because it much more angry and sinister that the other two love when wedge blow up the tie then fly through the flame m glad lucas change this for the special edition because be always confuse as kid there the music my god the music john williams be always great and all 6 be great but this one in particular be the best especially during the last fight just think of it with other music and it totally different 3p0 and r2 bickering be so funny and alec guinness really help bring weight to the history in the movie something about his warm presence really add lot to the movie he make it so seem real but have to say my favorite scene and don know why maybe because you can boil star war down to this one moment be when luke and leah swing across the chasm the music the guy hold the girl the adventure the romance something about it get me every time as kid star war be dead be bear in 85 and that be the low year of star war popularity so this wasn shove in my face my dad show me the movie because they be pg there be no add none of my friend be into it but love it and be obsess no influence from any where that show you the effect it have on kid it do in 77 all the way till now and it will forever lucas make something that speak to not only kid but the kid in all of us can tell you how many time site star war to distinguish between right and wrong and my lesson haven stop they continue with age lucas be the midi chlorian that show us the force this side of ourselves really wonder where the world would be without star war
now know why this be consider bomb long time ago remember my high school english teacher tell us about this film say it be very expensive bomb not have see it at the time be under unable to understand why he say this just take his word for it now finally for the first time muster the patience to watch this film from start to finish and have see it can fully appreciate what my teacher be talk about give it three star because on the positive side be beautiful to look at specifically the cinematography be very good the set be gorgeous especially like the view of the alexandria port although there so many spectacular set that it become distraction the costume be also beautiful although again there be too many of them in one scene taylor and burton change costume three time isn that overdo it speak of costume let me be blunt about something yes liz have get great chest but be it necessary to show off her cleavage so many time in so many provocative outfit that also become distract and help to make this film into parody by the way for those of us familiar with the legend of how cleopatra die and just where on her anatomy that deadly asp supposedly bite her why aren liz considerable asset show off at that last critical moment they be entirely ignore in that scene and consider the build up we be treat to throughout the whole film the climax come as let down pun intend my big gripe with this movie be that it be horribly act with performance that be much much too over the top the best performance be that of harrison who seem to restrain himself from display unnecessary emotion and present us with character that be at least somewhat convincing not so with many of the other cast member the two other principle actor taylor and burton and even some of the less character g martin landau engage in so much screaming and yelling in this film and at least half of the time can even decipher exactly what they be yell about the movie surely want us to get catch up in the actor emotion but it impossible to do so as the story and the dialogue be not at all believable that bring me to another big problem with cleopatra which be the script it all over the damn place right from the very first scene the dialogue be hard to follow the writer and understand there be lot of them seem intent to cover every detail they can imagine connect with this story but fail to separate what we need to know from what we can do without we be force to wade through talkative mess in order to follow the story and that lead to third big problem with cleopatra it long talky and downright boring if you have four plus hour to kill and will add that have to spend considerably more time than that as kept fall asleep and have to back it up to the place where would nod off you might want to watch this but if you have something much more important to do like scrub the floor or mow the lawn you re good off do that sorry taylor and burton fan but that how see it
don even dvr it horrible write plot that make no sense and unbelievable character seriously can the show spend the money for good writer if they do think would even help the poor acting and casting
brilliant can say much without it spoil the movie rating 9 because lot of it move bit slowly but guess that be all for reason movie be fantastic but the end be even well definitely worth watch if you get bore by any chance stick through it trust me
pretty dull maybe just don get it or maybe you have to be in the banking industry to care but it very bore it literally just guy talk to each other and about money the entire length of the film like radio talk show the acting be fine and it not poorly do at all it just basically nothing to see kept wait for something to kick in story character something hate to be snob about it but honestly just can imagine how film like this actually get make mean what be the inspiration who be the intended demographic again maybe it just me and m hung up on film with action interest character and colorful story and set but can even squeeze hard and push out something cool to say about this film really wish could it like expect rock concert and get to read newspaper instead
a movie without value or substance be hop for story about the challenge of someone do their best to get by something along the line of how to make hard decision and then live with the consequence it could either have be positive and uplifting or downward spiral into darkness both be typically interesting to watch unfortunately this movie go in neither of those direction instead it about girl name angelina who admittedly doesn have an easy home life but rather than have that bother her or drive her to change her circumstance she fairly unphased by it all on top of that angelina be extremely self center and completely lack in anything but the shallow version of empathy she appear to be young naive and innocent but in reality she just innocently use people have hard time feel any sympathy for her and what little do have dwindle bit by bit as the movie play on in summary about cherry have no strength to speak of and more than anything else seem to be an unnoteworthy account of how some people get by exploit others in order to make their own life well there nothing interest about the interpersonal relationship and the main character be highly unlikable my recommendation be to pass on watch this movie and forget that you ve ever hear of it
an honest review my opinion so want to begin this review by say be new to the star war universe have see all the film yet however in say that ive see plenty of film to know what be good and what isnt watched episode iv during the christmas period with my family which be star war fan and know if be every go to watch anything from the series it need to be in order in say that my experience watch episode iv wasnt the most jawdropping experience that everyone have make it out to be it start off with r2d2 and c3po travel through desert with no real explanation as to why if it be entertain or throw plot at me different story but it drag on for long than it need to yes know it lead to the next scene but lead up to it be bore the next part that take me out of the moment for the movie be luke emotional distress when his when his aunt and uncle die sacasm be strong with this one pun intend he have grow up with them for the majority of his youth and they have raise him since his parent die the moment he discover the fate of them he reaction be priceless that there be basically none this be an emotional ordeal for most luke never seem phase by this for the rest of the film this be in my opinion the downside of the film for me as the begining feel should really draw you in it have be basic story tell tactic since story begin be tell so anyone who say anything about it be how story be tell at the time be clearly wrong that be why have give it the score have for me the begin be as important as the end however will say the pacing after this point be really good story really pick up and introduced great character and end well episode i will say be an amazing movie that would watch again however the same can not be say for episode iv this of course be my personal opinion if you enjoy it good on you however be not one of them
long sitcom with no laugh track suppose scorcese name mean this be suppose to be good movie he hat comic book movie but at least they re entertain this be 97 minute sitcom without the laugh or the laugh track to let us know something funny happen the main character meet girl go to her house in soho and the next thing he know he out of money and can get home after his miserable date all he want to do be get home but one mishap after another keep him hostage in the soho district all night like say it would have be good if it be at least funny because it wasn all that creative
if these be my child would run away don get me wrong this show be very entertaining but it also crowd to insanity with way too much teenage angst into it four season and that be also its weakness top notch cast lead by terri polo stef and sheri saum lena as lesbian parent of five kid one of them brandon be from polo earlier marriage before she come out and they have adopt two twin latino kid mariana cierra ramirez and jesus jake austin and later noah centineo who have be through the system of foster home follow the abandonment of their parent to drug and other issue the show open just as they come to care for sister callie maia mitchell and brother jude hayden byerly who have be in numerous foster home and be reject for adoption numerous time stef be cop competent almost swagger him her zeal to be right while lena be teacher for charter school the family live in one of the most gorgeous art craft house in san diego you ve ever see there no way in hell they could afford this and five kid stef and lena try to instill parental control but it a losing battle from the get go as these kid do the dumb thing over and over again they be in constant peril whether through the foster parent system that suck assume the kid be screw up and doesn protect them to the constant shifting of their own personal story so jude be gay and have all those attendant issue callie can help her attraction to her old foster brother brandon and the two of them nearly wreck their chance at solid family life through the first two season mariana be an insecure if smart and talented young lady but she also bitch and troublemaker and can ever keep secret which lead to insane plot line that cause the family no end of trouble jesus be sweet and sexy to the girl but dumb as post and if that isn absurd enough consider callie whose mother die when she be fourteen have rich father who never know of her existence he come on the scene to imperil her adoption mariana and jesus have birth parent too the mother be neglectful drug addict and their father be man who have be false accuse of be sexual offender by the twin mother and her parent these young teen age 14 to 16 couple split up change partner and do some really dumb stuff typical of teenager you say if be the parent of any of these kid d like them up they be danger to them self and need to be protect from themselves this kid experience it all car accident confrontation with the police show their lack of respect for anyone old than they be and still the mother here though stress out all the time by the antic of their kid forgive them encourage them love them and wait for the next wave of disaster that be sure to come grow up very sophisticated teenager with lot of freedom from the age of 12 it be the 60s and never manage to get into the kind of trouble these sibling be enforce to do by the writer of this show marianna be particularly annoy but oh say that earlier this lady need to be lock into her room her phone take away and her outrageous send of entitlement frozen until she at least 25 callie can take on too little cause to justify her need to fix kid lose of the foster system brandon need to be keep away from needy girl he can not help but run to their rescue often with disastrous result jesus be just dumb teenager who never seem to have have reflective moment in his life that leave justin the quietest of the quintet everybody ex show up in this show and the end up live together it so weird the foster be good about explore all subject teen pregnancy gay sex teen self absorption the pathetic stage of the foster care system we see an attractive committed lesbian couple take care of their kid and believe me these kid be not nearly grateful enough for the little that be ask of them the show tackle very adult theme and that good for teenager
the real end to star war return of the jedi be certainly the weak of the original star war trilogy but fortunately we have the redemption of darth vader arc which go and salvage the entire film without it the movie would be disappointment on par with the matrix 3 pirate of the caribbean 3 the godfather 3 the hobbit 3 and all of cinema other fail three quels the road to vader redemption be quite bumpy however all the jabba palace scene while relentlessly creative really add nothing to the overall story and function simply as protract and needlessly convoluted procedure into bring back harrison ford that be say these scene be probably where the original trilogy get close to its pulpy inspiration as possible ve read fair share of 1930s pulp sci fi and everything in these scene goofy monster rancor pit bikini slave simply screams 1930s sci fi it interest but ultimately not that necessary once we get to endor the movie improve after some sluggish pacing and perfectly shot speeder bike chase we finally get to see luke confrontation with the emperor which be where the movie really succeed the scene with luke and his father on the death star be probably the most powerful of any star war movie ever they also give the story meaning and even achieve moral statement that nearly no american blockbuster even try to show kudos to lucas for pull that off also it not against vader character that he turn to the light side be it so surprising that he would chuck palpatine down the chasm when the latter be literally try to get his son to kill him few minute ago meanwhile the rest of the battle of endor be pretty excellent lucas like multi front battle woven together the phantom menace have an even more complex one and he deliver here while second death star implies creative bankruptcy the space battle above it be more exciting and massive than in the original film the endor forest battle be controversial and the ewoks defeat the empire best troop be little cheesy but it still excite for what it be and when watch it for the first time be probably one of the only kid who get the reference to the swiss family robinson film from 1960 anyway the fact remain that the end be perfect for the skywalker saga bring the two previous movie and yes the prequels full circle why follow it up with mediocre sequel trilogy bent on give all these character terrible end the empire be destroy forever and balance be restore let them celebrate they win
intelligent movie don understand all the hate that noah the movie be get personally think it be great movie but maybe it because m an artist so understand what art be and isn suppose to be seem as if lot of people especially christian think they be go to see documentary or theological disputation actually think it stick very well to the biblical account maybe people don know their bible as well as they think they do if you don like the story how that the movie fault fall angels giant genocide etc be all in the bible yes m talk about the actual bible not the version you be teach in sunday school when you be five year old anyway if you be at all philosophically incline and don mind movie that make you think about serious and even existential question ignore the hater go see noah haven be so emotionally move and intellectually stimulate from movie for quite while it not for the weak of heart after all it a story about genocide but it be beautifully make and in my opinion stay true to the biblical account
really disappointing after the fuss about this be expect well pace heart warm mesmerising film but frankly be bore rigid as be the rest of the family the dance be passable for your average amateur production and ve see amateur production with much good but homage to astaire and rogers or even second rate 50s musical they re not bit of hop about and swing her round and that your lot the music be pleasant enough but instantly forgettable plot well you follow two pleasant enough but essentially bland character for while she swear she will always love him then find someone else without backward glance he get to play his jazz that about it but because it drift through with all the dynamism of space out sloth it take age
an action fill fun change of pace sometimes you go to pixar movie and get deeply insightful heart tug classic that sing to the deep corner of the human condition and sometimes you go to pixar movie for some uncomplicated fun and adventure car 2 be unapologetically the latter it never reach the emotional depth of up or toy story 3 but it never try to be instead this be family friendly action pack adventure movie the kind of movie you watch because you just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle whether it the gorgeous scenery the breakneck chase sequence or finn mcmissile never end arsenal of cool gadget car 2 be movie that simply want you to have fun as you follow along with its whirlwind escapades some might feel this be disappointment from pixar but think that be unfair after all no one begrudge steven spielberg for produce both schinder list and indiana jones car 2 isn high art but it never try to be even the best creator deserve to cut back and have fun once in while
a bad film after good book about great band so many thing throw in no time to get to know the band no time to feel anything it just mess of cheesy stuff sad stuff good music bad acting and rubbish camera work this could have be so good but sadly
put the album to imagery lend the music whole new depth and conduit for enjoyment m sure before see this movie ve listen to the whole album of the wall it kind of incoherent and boring grant it fill with whole bunch of great and beautiful song but there too much filler and the story be give no chance at really be tell seeing as the lyircs as ridiculously metaphorical and internalize the movie however put image and word to the music and what it be that they be try to say not only make sense but be enhance and you really get to see the power and raw emotion in this terribly yet beautifully tragic story about internal descent the story behind the movie be our protagonist be rock star whose tragic life and personal excess have be get to him eventually lead to reflection of his memory eventually lead to him imagine himself as fascist dictator the wall refers to wall he figuratively build around himself to psychologically protect himself with obsession over parental figure and the horror of war you have to imagine that this movie would be perfect for psychological education the format of the film be series of either painfully realistic or surreal or both sequence show with the song that that would represent it in the album the production value be at time inconsistent but the power of the film as whole be amaze this really be an piece art at its best the album be the soundtrack to the movie
movie like this give independent cinema bad name don waste 90 minute of your time on fast food fast woman it annoyingly episodic script with three story line patch together be laughably bad due to predictable write horrific acting and even bad music find the anorexic main character upset to watch every time she be on screen she need the fast food spend the 90 minute you devote to this turkey do something more exciting like trim your toenail you have more entertainment value the only redeeming thing about this film be louise lasser but she deserve much good than this tired script it as impotent as the elder guy she court in the movie viewer beware
boy be disappoint to the point of mad this movie frankly do not deserve its high rank the plot such as it be be that rick be try to run cafe in casablanca refugee zone where victor laslo and his spouse ilsa former lover of rick show up during world war 2 victor must get out but rick who have accidentally get some paper of transit which be widely know to be nonsense concept in reality somehow victor get to get those paper and we re suppose to be entertain by lot of people just stand around try to be witty and often except claude rain few time fall flat on their face this have get to be the bad possible way to approach story about world war two it about love story and of course hollywood type where affair be justify so long as the party be attractive enough no real exploration into what be go on at the time be make and frankly the all nazi be bad but we ally can help but be good stance frankly be old by then it triumph of the will reverse only not as well make mean yes the nazi party be the most blatantly evil in existence maybe the japanese one be as bad if you study what happen in china but that doesn mean every nazi be ready to shoot at moment notice and not every officer more arrogant version of colonel klink wrap up this movie be obsolete trash not worthy of your time
not that bad since its release be avoid this movie because of its bad review however watch it out of boredom recently and must say wonder why it be rat that bad sure it no masterpiece but in my honest opinion it at least deserves to be call nice the film draw slightly different image of catwoman but thats okay this be not suppose to be the story of selina kyle after all patience phillips be in many regard quite unlike kyle so it would only be natural for this catwoman to differ significantly from the original one the one thing be criticize the most be that the plot have to less time to unfold everything seem bit rushed that a common illness to movie of the 21st century but don think cgi be use all too much it be allow to use some modern technology after all isn it and for the closing have no idea how halle berry get that bad actress razzie award she might have overact some prance on the rooftop but to me that just cartoon and to be smile on amused yes kitty you be feline femme fatale
not very good very slow disappointing and over rat judging by the review though it would be good film stop lying people
this film be at least 6 really don know how people can be so harsh the movie be entertain and good fun for most of it nearly all of the actor in it be good and well know the cgi be very impressive and be surprise the fight scene be good and fun to watch actually enjoy it thing that let it down be 1 matthew lillard be joke he really cant act and make you cringe when he speak its so bad 2 terrible music score people talk about how music can make movie imagine jaw without the theme and halloween without the tense music well the music be so bad in this film it spoil it wonder how well it would have do with han zimmer or the late john williams behind the music 3 nothing particularly new in the story very similar to part of lotr and eragon overall like it and people who give it such bad score must not be into this sort of genre or be be too picky as its an enjoyable movie to watch
exploit real suffering and pander for sympathy without do anything genuine this be hard film to adequately review because so much be right with it yet at the same time so much be wrong or if not wrong at least there be some major tone that simply do not work for me the cast be spectacular emma stone be not just adorable but skilled and marvelous actor you don need me to remark that she have stellar career ahead of her the rest of the cast include some of those great character actor you see in the good film but can quite remember where you ve see them before but that a plus for character actor as their appearance therefore always seem fresh it feel very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong the abuse and inhumane treatment endure by black people 50 year ago be hard to watch today the pain inflict and the behavior of the oppressor can only be call an evil situation one hop that evolution have do its work and social justice prevails today if not perfectly then at least to tolerable degree but that be part of the problem to me this film seem to merely recycle old trope of injustice it seem to be as one of my professor use to call it pot stirrer lot of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos but here it doesn seem to be authentic it certainly doesn seem to go anywhere it almost as if the writer have take an easy issue guarantee to provoke outrage and anger rather than do the authentic and difficult artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and heal this film might be to be blunt merely counterfeit social justice it might be brazen attempt to push button for undeserved sympathy sincerely hope be mistaken and overly unkind grant that a subtle point but that also why find the theme of the film bit objectionable it seem as if the filmmaker be take advantage of most people natural and gut level decency to elicit an audience response on tabloid level far who would dare to criticize this film it almost as if it be criticism proof therefore unsound dramatic treatment will go by without comment give that think that be do deliberately even if somewhat unconsciously this movie take an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffer and even die and shamelessly exploit that to make few buck at the box office think about it what insights or new theme be introduce here d say none it may be an example of what plato call pandering go for the cheap point via stimulus response fest hope be wrong hope it be really just matter of me not respond to this particular cinematic venture if be even partly right however it bode ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless junk medium environment
omg absolutely amaze ok only go to see this because of the wachowski brother involvement go totally expect to hate this movie about terrorist but it be so much more m amaze to say that it awesome while not an action picture there plenty of action and at least one funny homage to the matrix you ve get ta see it it very inspire believe it or not and it didn make me want to blow up building either it just make me appreciate freedom even more hugo weaving be terrific and natalie portman leave princess amadala far behind with her performance as evey everyone great stephen rea be terrific too just can believe like this movie m still in shock
voice should have be call the new accent such ridiculous voice m glad this movie exist so future writer and producer will know what doesn work
very over rat this be not good film by an standard it be very poorly write and the acting be just little above par some performance be well below par but swayze and grey do very good job with little to work with what be good the dance sequence be choreograph very well and as state above swayze and grey be high point what be bad the script the bad guy be simply too evil to be believable the best villain be the one who aren so obviously evil these guy the owner nephew the waiter who impregnate the girl do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people perhaps there be guy like them but sure don want to see movie about it another scene the first where grey and swayze meet when the employee at the resort be dance swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves the next time they meet swayze be hostile towards her why what happen in between to make him dislike her so when they dance well together and some of those line mean come on cringe at the end when swayze mutter the line nobody put baby in the corner how do he ever do that with straight face another thing wrong the setting of the 1960 everyone look and dress like the 1980 who be in charge of the costume and hairstyles the music original music for the film be laughable with the exception of have the time of my life which be good song not the bad film ve ever see but definitely the most over rat
bore predictable boring and disappointing want to give it chance but instead could not find myself watch another episode it be so cringy and cheesy
awful write it not often don manage to plow trough movie but the writing on this one be undoubtedly the bad have see in long time the bafflingly horrible dialogue and characterization be insult for viewer with even shred sense be this film student project go horribly awry in character drive movie you think there would be at least little effort make on the way characterization basically what this movie boil down to be the scenery with cheesy plot even bad dialogue and no real heart or mind behind it cheap money grab form dimwits to dimwits if absolutely would have to say anything good about it be that most of the shot where in focus

joker please come back what sad affair be look forward to this and be bitterly disappointed batman begin should have be as good as the first in the series but to me it be as bad as batman and robin if for totally different reason let me start with the good thing first batman christian bale be the best batman yet he be good look without look ridiculous the acting be adequate and it be shame that the script do not allow him to make use of his talent like gordon oldman mark boone be okay and cillian murphy as dr crane be brilliant the others caine caricature freeman the same neeson be just incredibly bad in superhero movie and would include the bond film here the woman have to be beautiful and she should be charismatic how anyone could come up with the idea of cast katie holmes be mystery gotham be very good more realistic than burton but equally good when the camera show us the bad corrupt and yet beautiful city really like the movie unfortunately the music spoil it immediately hans zimmer be just amaze he be at the same time one of the most successful composer in hollywood and easily the bad every film where he contribute the music be bad do not check that but think can rely on memory at best the music be just bore at bad it totally spoil the mood how he keep his job and reputation be just beyond me we learn the origin of batman good idea but the trip to asia be that not the origin of dr strange but could buy that but what can not tolerate be bad villain now understand that these day the evil can not be just evil it be bore but there be world of difference between good villain like joker magneto doc ock and hopefully dr doom and ra al ghul ducard know it be in good tradition of the bible but the evil wanting to destroy because people be bad be just bit too ridiculous finally the car yes batman drive in car why first to make the toy maker happy and second because there be this hollywood wisdom if you do not have story put in car chase this be utterly repulsive if there be someone old than 5 year on this planet who actually enjoy see car jumping from roof to roof would like to be introduce to him chance be he escape from arkham
be the only one who think this movie be overrate major spoiler warn spoiler see that on this site only the positive review for this film be promote to be on the first page which be at least one side if not preferential this make me think win even get read by other user yet alone support by them since they all find this movie awesome but whatever let me tell you what think about this movie the story be probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie get so awfully wrong 1 the concept of machine imprison human be exploit so many time stargate for example have similar concept drive episode by so many tv show and movie so expect this movie to go deep in why would machine imprison human and have authenticity in its core get 0 of that in fact what do get some stupid explanation say the machine imprison human because human loose energy as heat through their skin ok it might seem plausible at first sight but if you know little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible human lose through heat about 30 of the energy they consume so that would mean the machine would have to supply the human with so much energy and then consume the 30 they lose through heat basically 100 energy use to keep human alive to 30 energy remain for machine that mean the machine would lose about 70 of the energy they have or invest into sustain human alive why because the script say so if they have that much energy to sustain human and their necessity for so long why not kill the human and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie show to be very satisfy 2 the explanation morpheus give neo be so thin maybe thin than balloon inflate to its maximum the matrix be weak at the beginning so that they escape why hasn anyone else escape how be the matrix weaker do this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this no but yeah because there a bad as character say these we all should believe this and then say that this movie be benchmark for all sci fi to come can not believe that m living on this planet where people be fool so easily by ridiculous explanation that be so thin and they think that they be smart by watch these kind of movie oh but there more when other director come up with movie think over 15 year inception and so authentic and realistically execute that start from correct premise and then exaggerates like any other movie people make review like overrate because it make people feel smart it incredible that director that have be make movie since 7 year old and think so much about its movie be repay with bad review from people who clearly didn understood the movie and don care about dream while this movie get so much praise for have an incorrect premise that just become bad as the movie progress 3 there no plot twist that can make you say yes this movie be think from start to finish this movie be just bunch of action scene mix with some poorly explain concept that have an incorrect scientifically premise and have just enough of all of them to fool the average audience the action the only part in which this movie succeed be the action which indeed revolutionize the action flick back then along with the cgi this make the movie watchable at best for me at least but here there be some unexplained thing like why if you kiss person connect to the matrix that person revives and more becomes even more powerful it like child movie where the handsome prince kiss the prince and she wake up and then they live happily ever after expect much more from movie praise by so many people but get 0 explanation for how neo revives from trinity kiss the character bland and boring and so cold especially morpheus who be make like this maybe to make him appear more bad as neo character be childish for movie of this magnitude the chemistry between him and trinty be not convince for me mean for the duration of the whole movie she just kick as like neo and then they suddenly be lover but their relationship have no development because the script be so poor in substance and create no circumstance in which these character might interact with each other beside kick as and say one liners the soundtrack get ta hurry word limit the most bland soundtrack ve heard in my life for how this movie be promote as be one of the best ever expect soundtrack that could match this reputation actually if you search don davis this composer be know only for matrix and maybe jurassic park iii but aside from that he be never nominate for golden globe bafta or oscar not to say that those matter but other great composer be nominate at least 10 time to oscar or baftas there be not single iconic track in this movie and the score as whole be just forgettable and underwhelmed hope could include everything want to say in this review probably win get any support for this review because every person on this planet adore this movie and imdb support only good review for this movie and as to why rate this movie with 5 be because of the cgi and action scene because the rest premise story substance or authenticity of the script be either miss or be so thin as inflated balloon oh wait the rating of this movie be as inflated as inflated balloon inflate by average people who like only mindless or pseudo intelligent action
beautiful an experiment of company distribute some baby super pig so that farmer around the world create them and after 10 year the super pig would be return to the company in the meantime the granddaughter of one of these farmer create friendship with okja the super pig which be grant to her grandfather after the company rescue and abuse the animal the little girl do everything to save her friend touching and well do
most emotional movie be enchant by this film musical film be not my favorite genre but this film strike me immediately think it be famous only for the presence of john legend instead it have secondary role think the storytelling be perfect it keep you attach to the screen for the duration of the film the song and choreography be simply gorgeous think it perfect from start to finish start with an incredible long take and end make you cry the photograph have goose bump color the direction and edit perfect this be film that you can watch over and over again every time you you be surprise more and more after 5 minute of view it have become an instant cult for me as soon as the 1st vision be over it have become my favorite film and every time vision be even more so thanks to damien chazelle who after whiplash and guy and madeline on park bench give us another extraordinary film and hope it can continue like this
overrate but good film especially the first time empire be an entertaining film and terrific setup for the finale the battle and setup at hoth be entertain the exchange between han and lea be entertain the droids be quite funny in this one but don belittle the drama the development of darth vader and the empire be vicious and well place the end real cliff hanger and surprise the first time through so why not 10 star my main complaint of the film be the middle act isn excite just think for second about all the fun action in the middle of new hope compare to empire in new hope they get on the falcon luke train in the force planet be destroy they encounter the death star they hide from the troop they save the princess obi wan fight vader and die they fight off ton of troop to get back to the falcon and they fight some tie fighter in the air to escape the death star in empire strike back han lea and company try to escape the empire before eventually get catch darth vader and the empire decide to try to convert luke and luke learns from yoda before eventually leave against yoda will to save his friend sorry empire but in comparison that isn a lot of excitement especially if you have already see the film before how could the middle act have be well you might ask say increase the pace of everything especially yoda and luke first meeting maybe han could have have chewy and or lea firing at the tie fighter and bomber from the gunner position while on the run there also could have be space fight with cloud city with lando save the falcon crew at the last moment all m say be that there a real excitement void in the middle act of the movie which everyone seem to gloss over and think this shortcoming be more than enough to make empire the bad rather than the best of the original trilogy it still solid film but like return of the jedi and new hope more and m bewilder by the mass who proclaim empire to be the best star war movie or one of the best movie ever
very distant from the rest of the franchise the rambo franchise hasn 39 be know for its subtlety and that be prove when sylvestre stallone return to the role back in 2008 the amount of violence throughout that film give action junky everything they be ask for it also take the outrageously bloody aspect of the franchise to another level as well wrap up in nice bow by the time the credit roll 2008s rambo seem to be the finale well apparently not as rambo last blood be now in theatre sadly this franchise definitely should have end with the previous instalment here 39 why believe this movie simply doesn 39 work br br now retire and take care of ranch out in the county john rambo have evolve into seemingly much calm man after his niece make poor decision to find out the truth of who her real father have become out in mexico all hell break loose as john find himself on the hunt to save his family without ruin anything one thing lead to another and he eventually need to use his home as giant war zone booby trap to fend off his enemy in theory this premise be great set up for an action film that simply want to focus on the action itself but it really doesn 39 feel anything like rambo movie br br be war veteran and fend off his enemy throughout the course of his entire life john rambo be character with lot of complexity for this reason alone many of the rambo film have be able to tell interesting story even if the execution wasn 39 always there this time around he have become family man and an emotional tie be what get him back in the game the finale of this movie be the only remotely entertaining aspect but the set up for it just felt like an excuse for revenge movie which be never truly what the rambo film have be br br stallone be commit to this character as always and yvette monreal as his niece be actually quite good but their dynamic just felt like it belong in another movie with the addition of some very cheesy dialogue at time and the fact that john rambo be the only one who feel like real flesh out character find myself not really care about what happen to anyone here that say audience who watch rambo movie be usually there for the action anyways and if you 39 re fan of gory violence that 39 do well then the final 20 minute may be enough for you br br in the end rambo last blood be mixture of element from movie like take and home alone with an elderly war hero at the forefront and the violence crank up to thousand there be moment of enjoyment and even few time where be have little fun but it really be an emotional movie that doesn 39 feel earn it ask you to care about character that haven 39 be around for much of the franchise and just couldn 39 buy it for die hard fan of the franchise maybe check it out once it 39 available to rent or buy at home but really don 39 think it 39 worth your time
a horrible butchering of everything know and love the editing be horrible the shot choice be jar and confuse the dialogue be all clunky and expository the character don progress at all the story be awkward and disjointed if you haven read all the book and pottermore you win understand anything if you have you might understand third or so
absurd and so predictable this movie be annoy in several way the criminal be all goodhearted thoughtful sensitive guy while the guard and warden be the real bad guy gim me break what be this duke of hazard which be far good than this further the plot be so so so predicable good guy outsmart the bad guy and real justice be serve spare me know lot of people love this flick but in my humble opinion it be big waste of time 3
there nothing like it it an amazing movie the director be amaze ryan gosling and emma stone chemistry be amaze the song dance and color this be la la land
not sure why it call primal fear saw this film few day ago be quite impressed ve think about it some more since then and it occur to me that it clever on some other level richard gere be the big name but edward norton be the star of the show now when initially saw it it occur to me that edward character have pull the wool over everyones eye and get away with murder but the reason he commit the murder be abuse by the catholic church now be that justifiable reason for murder and rather than justice be dodge go to jail for murder have mob justice actually be carry out
wow fast smart and tough real treat masterfully pace and script wow hold up very very well this movie suck you in from the opening credit and never let go it also bit of mind game with an interesting moral dilemma at its center and beautiful plot twist towards the end nobody tell hysterical dame to shut up quite like charles mcgraw and few femme fatales can blow cigarette smoke quite like marie windsor who look astonishingly like the present day actress illeana douglas the two of them have great smolder chemistry together richard fleischer direction be nearly flawless joy to watch can wait to see it again there a lot go on in this one by no mean routine thriller
love the movie but can recommend it spoiler alert for many of the same reason that other reviewer have give really enjoy this movie it creep me out in the kubrick way that d hop it would and the score be amaze however be really turn off by glazer conscious decision to film scream apparently terrify baby on rocky beach in the middle of the night with wave crash and roar just foot away just to up the queasiness factor crew member have to have be nearby of course and without have be there can prove the baby be terrify hell m not parent maybe he just need diaper change but glazer himself have this to say on the scene in an interview with timeout there a powerful scene with baby abandon on wintry beach how be that to film when we film that scene the crew look at me like be king poison but that be the scene it a baby abandon on beach we feel empathy because we re human but how do she the alien see it not as we do we ve never have that moment of green martian come here in spaceship this be how we measure the gulf between her and us so jonathan glazer terrify baby be the only vehicle you could come up with to convey the alien lack of empathy you be fresh out of idea that didn involve scar the hell out of terrified child too young to verbalize his thought on the script oh wait he be verbalize his thought by cry his lung out full disclosure even after the baby scene remain through the end credit but in the 30 hour since ve felt increasingly ill at ease that do so there should never be reason to victimize child just for the sake of film make otherwise great story concept and score very unsettling and creepy wish could watch it again but win and win recommend it to friends
absorb well dramatize well act suspenseful story with excellent portrayal by steve mcqueen and dustin hoffman
fair game be an accurate portrayal of the government self interest fair game be supposedly the next up and come jfk type of movie where we get to take hard look at controversy and conspiracy as expect the movie deal in some very complex jargon and can be difficult to follow as we get further and far into the movie begin to accept the fact that be not go to be entertain and that be go to learn something about how our government operate which do this happen rather quickly and adjust to the movie play out more like doucmentary with highly skilled actor rather than something like air force one the 2 main character become exposed and brand as traitor by their own us government and find out what it be like to be all by themselves in the fight against large impersonal entity white house official discredit joe wilson sean penn account of the government falsify information to justify invade iraq the abuse of power discover by these character be pretty incredible when you have government that will say practically anything to protect its public image lot of drama and fact find ensues and the movie be both compelling and infuriate at the same time the dialogue be mature and smart and we draw close into the life of the married couple who like diamond seem to be able to strengthen their marriage through the trial of pressure valerie plame naomi watt and joe wilson sean penn be the married couple plame cia agent who identity be expose and wilson who write the controversial but truthful piece which lead to the government destruction of their life or at least the attempt the validity in wilson story be apparent by how much uproar and backlash be cause when the government go public with their side of the story
an action masterpiece ridiculous in all the right way 9 5 10 george miller return to live action filmmaking with one of the great action film ever put to screen mad max fury road be ridiculous in all the right way for those who have see the original film and love them you ll fall in love all over again with this film tom hardy take the reign this time around as max man of few word who have be harden by the world in which he live along with him be charlize theron as imperator furiosa woman who seek redemption by help five young wife escape from the film antagonist lead up to the film release many speculate if this would be just another action film that lack solid narrative and motive but be happy to say that this be simply not the case yes the film do fill 80 of its run time with action sequence but it never get in the way of the humanity between these character that miller have bring to life there be some emotional moment specifically with theron character be the story something we haven see before not at all but in film load with action it nice to see solid narrative now how about those action sequence incredible exhilarate jaw drop george miller have put together some of the great most memorable action set piece ever one thing that set the action in this film apart from good majority of mediocre action film today be that every action the character make have an affect on them for good and for bad the action be not pointless it motivate and it glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effect incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography mad max fury road have set new standard for action film it arguably the great action film of the 21st century it that good george miller have bring back what we love about 80 action film while also brine new idea to the table it the best time ve have in theater in long time and couldn help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that be unfold before my eye the film leave me feel giddy with big smile on my face
good enough but historically sketchy this be good enough movie but skirt around the true story in order to make clunky point about genius hound to death for his homosexuality the plot be simple britain be lose the war and desperately need something to have chance of survival crack nazi code to stop attack at sea and in the air might just tip the balance step forward the secret decoding establishment at bletchley park where expert mathematician and linguist be recruit to try and break the famous code send via the german enigma machine and step forward one alan turing of cambridge university resident if gay genius play by benedict cumberbatch to break the code apparently turing invents machine to do this of course this be all nonsense the pole have build machine previously to do this work and have break enigma but with increase sophistication they no longer have the resource so hand over their work to the british along with captured enigma machine from the wehrmacht so tension mount as turing uses ton of money on new sic totally innovative machine which do not seem to be quick enough on the way an overly attractive joan clark play by keira knightley double first help out and get engage to turing while silly old commander dennison play by charles dance try to close down the machine eventually chance remark and realisation of something bleedin obvious put turing and co on the right track just time for we must not use all information or jerry will know we have break his code so little chat about who be save and who isn which be pretty peripheral before get to the climax where turing be chemically castrate by an unfeeling and totally ungrateful country the thriller element be okay but turing can do no wrong except tell clark to leave bletchley which get short feminist shrift oh dear the script can not help itself from be so terribly 21st century liberal in its preachy part pity some other unsung hero like tommy flower and the pole do not get mention the acting be fine all round the direction serviceable and it work at its own level but the one man band tub thump with cumberbatch twitching and not look directly at people obvious oscar material like rain man really do disservice to the great team effort of the wartime code breaker remember an even more advanced valve base machine for break code be develop with little participation from turing by work class gpo man tommy flower who use his own money to finance it hope his story be not overlook just because he be straightforwardly normal
extremely well produce inaccurate and for me unwatchable it an unfortunate truism nowadays that any major film production in the uk must at least try to secure us fund and fail that aim in part at us audience to have hope of recoup production cost the imitation game be prime example of this phenomenon the fact that this mess garner an oscar be testament to where the movie be aim at and apparently hit its target the british film industry and production talent be capable of create exquisite production and with great cast uk host some of the best acting talent in the world combine with usable screenplay it can make compelling cinema the screenplay for this effort use the mechanism of three story line of the principle character separate by time schooldays bletchley day and final police investigation of homosexual activity this could have be fine except for the screenwriter desire to overly write in melodrama where there be none additional fictional character as plot device etc the acting be good cumberbach do good job of effect turing as he be describe in the past to me however the result be movie that have trouble watch not recommend and m hoping for good stuff come out of the uk
remarkably bland keanu be one of those movie that you watch the trailer for and think that could either be really good or really bad unfortunately for anyone that be fan of key peele as be you will sorely disappointed envy those that can watch copy and paste movie and still find it as entertain as the last movie that do that because can get suck into film that doesn do anything new and keanu doesn do anything new at all in fact it shameless rips ton of different movie off be comedy expect this to happen here but also expect it to rip thing off in clever way never in the film do get the impression that they be parody any of this the most heinous shameless rip off be it plot line which be basically just reskinned less entertaining version of 21 jump street the story be literally about two guy that infiltrate gang to find something or someone right off the bat it clear they don belong in this world but they do enough dumb thing to gain the gang respect after get in good they realize that they may be in too deep there be even scene where one or more of the main character get super high and hallucinate exactly like the jump street movie the only difference here be that it be not do in clever or funny way most of the film be like this shamelessly rip off other good movie the bad part be it neither acknowledge or make fun of the way that it do this it act like everything it do be completely original and hop that you win notice not mention that most of the thing that happen don even matter to the plot at all nearly half of the film be fill with scene that do absolutely nothing to further the plot it stop the movie tell couple bad joke and get back to thing yet it doesn do it that quickly there be one scene in particular where they be in mansion with anna faris that drag on for way to long it go on for ten or fifteen minute tell the same joke on loop over and over oh this isn gangster man wtf you guy aren real gangster if you don listen to this and queue laugh track spoiler as if the film isn standard enough it even have the whole one main character be actually cop twist end by that point be no longer laugh with the movie be laugh at the movie and at all the incredibly dumb thing it do kid you not there be scene where wife call her husband and say that trust friend try something bad to her naturally he want to know what it be but she inexplicably hang up before she tell him then she get back to him and he just knock the guy out like thought that be friend plus you don even know what he do no one on earth would do what you just do why do this happen it like many other part of this movie seem to be throw in just to get laugh the writer didn think about logic or reason but instead opt for cheap chuckle the entire film be fill with moment that be so bad but easy to fix it be clear that the writer didn care about make good movie and instead simply want to pump this out nothing make any sense and no one bother ask about it however will say that key peele continue to have great chemistry they give very committed performance and be one of very few save grace the only other one would be the absurd story the plot be very tired boring and predictable but it story concept be just absurd enough to work it be fairly fun to see every single person want this random cat and it make the odd motivation little easy to forgive that be say would not recommend this film it overlong dull flat predictable and remarkably unfunny
a massively over hype empty disappointment so it have take me couple of year to get round to watch this film despite the fact that really want to see it when it come out sometimes just let film bypass me and wait til all the hype have calm down before watch them and can now see why didn go to any special length to watch this massively over hype empty disappointment firstly want to say that love old musical so this film should of be perfect for me also love emma stone load and gosling be pretty easy on the eye so this film already have me as an eager audience before it begin it turn sour pretty quickly be no dancer performer by any mean but be very confused when be watch some of the dancing scene keep think that be miss something why be the dancing so bad be this do on purpose for some reason have to watch my rogers astaire box set after this to balance out the awful dancing of stone gosling there be some thing like love the cinematography and the paintbox of colour throughout the film it be bright and very american and hollywood although this do bring me onto my next criticism what exactly be the point of this film other than for hollywood to just write massive love letter back to itself get that concept but really really hated how it be do here think dislike it so much because have expect to really love it think it would be this decade moulin rouge and it really wasn i glad ve finally watch it but m quite sure win ever do so again
a delightful merging of information and comedy no subject in the world be inherently interesting or uninteresting for it always about the communicative method or channel use to promote or inform one about the subject that be either interest or not have say that some subject be more alienating than others and one of those subject be economics finance largely because of its dependency upon plethora of terminology and jargon that usually can not be adequately define without include other terminology or jargon before you know it search the definition of something like roth ira lead you to google search about embezzlement and quantitative easing in effort to try and circumvent and define what you be originally look for thankfully adam mckay the big short assume the audience be fairly stupid and blissfully ignorant when it come to the interworkings of what lead to the global economic crisis of 2007 2008 which saw record unemployment and catastrophic result for the usually reliable housing market in true movie fashion we observe the financial crash not from an insider standpoint where sure fire grade trade and exchange be be make but by plethora of quirky outsider try to run away from boulder that keep gain on them until it flatten them and everyone in their track the only one save be the one who didn manage to fall or stumble when push say boulder down the hill in the first place we initially meet quirky hedge fund manager name michael burry christian bale who discover that the s housing market be base on series of subprime loan which we be tell by margot robbie as she soak in bubblebath whilst sip champagne may as well be synonymous with and be inevitably go to collapse sometime in the second quarter of 2007 be that the housing market be often view as the safe bet in america michael begin to go around to different bank to bet against the stability and long term security of the housing market in effort to profit from the impend disaster then there jar vennett ryan gosling fairly small time investor who wind up put in his own money to bet against the housing market along with mark baum steve carell cynical and depressed banker of many year the two wind up discover that the market collapse be far aid by the solicitation of collateralized debt obligation cdos basically collection of the aforementioned subprime loan that come package together and market as competent and reliable investment finally there charlie geller john magaro and jamie shipley finn wittrock two young blood anxious to break into the financial market the inexperienced duo enlist in the help of retired conservative banker name ben rickert brad pitt who help them make decision with their money unlike the other more experienced men both charlie and jamie lack the kind of gusto and namesake that allow them into the office of big name banker as result they pine for big piece of the pie in small way largely by lounge in their parent basement hunch over their ipads the big short function as competent satirical anthology that break down the financial crisis that be now nearly decade old if you can believe that enough to be informative and entertain consider this be from adam mckay frequent collaborator with will ferrell and funny or die responsible for film like casa de mi padre the other guy and step brother this be huge step in the right direction for him as name in comedy and satire rather than focus on bargain barrel spanish telenovela satire or tired mean spirit comedy base around who can yell the loud mckay set his sight on peddle information through the most communicable form entertainment if you can succeed in merit consistent laugh while teach an audience something you have profoundly succeed at two thing many have difficult time accomplish in separate sense that alone be worth considerable praise while the screenplay by mckay and charles randolph be undoubtedly big part at why this film succeed the big short be true testament to brilliant comedic act on various cylinder as well the men of the hour specifically be both bale and carell seriously take on opposite persona that they pull off to tee bale play confuse and downright quirky with just the right amount of edge to make him believable rather than hopelessly incompetent or downright silly and carell sporadic bout of rage and lack of self awareness make him all the more watchable screen presence other performance like gosling who serve as the infrequent anti hero narrator be notable for its brash charm in addition to pitt who work largely because he even more understated and harder to define than in his late film by the sea the big short have lot of comedic value but it nonetheless frighten depiction of where america be currently at depress oligarchy control and manipulate by those with money at the mercy of those without we ve see the great recession of 2007 as it sometimes call plunge numerous work class and poor family into further state of hopelessness while those who help cause and further the effect of the recession have go on to have road of many ups and few down since then mckay eye ear and talent for conduct satire in way that simultaneously uproariously funny in addition to have the ability to be truly upsetting be quite marvelous and unexpected and one can only hope that with proper recognition and compensation for his effort on this film he further down this path rather than the one he be previously on
unbeliavably bore know leo deserve an oscar after so many good movie but this one be complete waste of time one of the slow most boring movie that could not even finish and just keep skip

look like good make for tv movie this be bit difficult to watch but not horrible for some reason this just strike me as make for tv movie perhaps it be direction or scenery or plot or dialogue have great difficulty with the main character and whether that portrayal of asperger be accurate somehow it seem off to me others here have say that it accurate and others inaccurate the use of the hidden camera be bite odd they make it seem that he be just do this to mimic people with no ill intent but obviously he would see all sort of private thing go on there in the hotel room and it not as if there be no other source for dialogue if he just want to practice speaking be we to believe that the asperger render him incapable of see how wrong this be he seem to understand that he would get in big trouble if they find out about his camera hence his immediate removal of them follow the incident and he also seem to have some concern for the two female he perceive to be at risk in the room what up with his inability to see the impropriety of spy on hotel guest but the movie be ok

that what happen when you expand single book into three movie well have to say that m glad that over the final movie be well worth the price of admission which in my case be free ticket to preview screen found this movie to be stretch and as the final movie in trilogy that be get less interest the further you go into the series leave feel extremely disappointed and glad didn pay for the premium experience 3d imax etc there be little too much cg this time around and it wasn even all that great case in point two close scene with rider approach and leave be clearly cg they couldn even afford to use real horse and rider come on the battle scene go on way too long and in part be even more ridiculous than the rid the broken wooden bridge all the way down to the bottom of the cavern scene in the early edition of this series and since the battle scene be pretty much all that carry this movie well yes this movie do have to be see and it should be view on big screen however in the opinion of this reviewer wait until it appear in second run theatre will provide good value for money it a movie that wrap up series but when compare to peter jackson original lotr work it pal and be as pale as an orc who have be work in the basement of orthanc at night with the light out

a little disappointing but still an entertaining horror comedy so go into this with fairly high expectation love horror comedy and this one look very promising funny premise great cast and zombie who doesn love zombie it wasn a bad movie by any mean but it do let me down little bit first off the main thing that kill my buzz with this be how unlikable elijah wood character be get that they be do this on purpose but the scene with him in them just make me get more and more irritated with his character it not that wood do bad job or anything it just that some of the line that be write for his character be almost cringe worthy bad that character however be more than make up for by how awesome rainn wilson character be some of his line be gold lot of the joke be great find myself laugh out loud multiple time but some of them just fell short and didn really work at all for the most part though the humor work well and help to move along the movie think the main thing that really keep this movie from be great be that the horror concept of it kind of get put on the back burner to the comedy in too many scene really wish they would have throw more horror element in there be far too many scene of the survivor just sit in various room of the school trading mediocre pretty decent dialogue overall this wasn bad in fact it be good movie be entertain and have fun time watch it but it could have use bit more gore and horror and little less mediocre joke still good ride though 6 5 10

as true austen lover have read the book and see the amazing 1995 series the only positive thing have to say about this absolute horrid failure of film be that the music be quite nice every possible thing be wrong with this film the script the language the setting and most of all the actor my god be that matthew mcfadyen suppose to be at all handsome and powerful he look like bloody wimp and keira love her in all her movie but she she should have stay away from this it take real woman to play elisabeth bennet don understand why they make remake of it when the 1995 series be absolutely perfect it be completely ludicrous

a dark insight into the superhero world start off be just review the film overall and not take in account any of the write source it base off watchman seem to be complex film and m sure and extremely hard to make an adaption of it seem with deal with material such as this one it almost impossible to please everybody watchman be about team of superheros that look after or watch the world around it and society which be suppose to take place in 1985 be warn this be not your regular superhero movie watchman seem to reveal much darker existence and reality into their world the world of these superheros that we have see so many time before this isn teenage peter parker run and fly through the street of new york this be much darker piece of work include graphic violence murder sex scene and nudity between these hero this film could be describe as controversial with all the history theme and meaning it go through it expand through many historical event such as the vietnam war and the nixon presidency the film start off with murder and mystery that surround it as it be say in the plot this side of the story be very interesting and entertain it keep my interest go forward not know what to expect interesting and suspenseful with sort of realism to it then the film sort of gradually go off into more of fantasy set with whole bunch of out space mystical object creature and end of the world hint didn really care for this side of the story but it be sort of fantasy superhero film base on the graphic novel so can knock it for be what it be suppose to be what didn like be how long it take to actually discover what be go on with the plot which turn out to be bit confuse there be bunch of goofy and corny part which really wasn need or could have be do well the sex scene for example seem kind of force and awkward now to the character since its more of character drive piece anyway oscar nominated actor jackie earle haley completely steal the show as rorschach every time he wasn on screen just keep wait for him to come back love his character and his storyline there not enough good thing can say about him and his performance him alone make the film worthwhile in my opinion just what if the others could be as good well for malin akerman as silk spectre ii can say she be bad but not all that great it seem obvious that she be pretty much put in this film as eye candy which she definitely succeed at overall like the rest of the cast and think they do pretty good job with few weak moment mainly ackerman some of the action sequence seem like they could have be do well snyder style make them look out of synch the visual look and feel of the film be well do the opening credit scene with the song playing be fantastic the song time be changin by bob dylan play in the background as these credit really set the tone and mood for the film beautifully do not all of the song seem to fit though some of them seem really out of place and even awkward at time interest dark cinematography with some great visuals most of the writing and dialog be great particularly rorschach scene and line maybe haley just make it that much good there be some weak moment as well mostly with ackerman line maybe because some of her weak delivery of some of her line don mean to pick on her but she seem to be the weak link in this one overall watchman seem like dense deep complex look at the superhero world it make for an interesting film that just have to see because be so intrigue by the rating with the dark graphic nature of this kind of superhero film it not perfect and m sure some people win like it but pretty good film nonetheless if you go in look for an interestingly do story about new kind of insight to the dark world of superheros then this film should work for you 6 5 7 out of 10
colder opportunities the equalizer be loosely base on an 80s television series with the same name this reinvention in comparison aim to be darker and much violent but the film ambition be basically turn its star denzel washington into gritty action hero it somehow pay off when he start kill bad guy in cold blood and it amaze how he could still carry the character humanity along the way the film trouble when it get out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it take place in world seem apart from that context if you tend to ignore the sentiment and shade of reality you can still tell that it a pretty entertaining piece of action but in general it just difficult to not notice its mess of tone even with that amount of fun there be one side in the film when it totally grip that be when we just see the protagonist as person living in an ordinary life often be with people and often encounter them get in trouble by crime this ground world just keep most of its darkness in their presence sometimes feel like doom helpless world but once the hero reveal what he truly be capable of it doesn actually suck out its entertainment quality but it do betrays that intrigue context nearly turn itself into superhero movie except of course it less silly and much violent mccall in shorthand be too competent for any criminal he fight and often leave with perfect swagger it may not be big deal to many viewer especially the action fan who be already enjoy the blood but the film set up an exist theme that seem to be lot interest to consider instead of indulge itself with its own way of justice the cool slow mo and stylish special effect might have also rob the sense of realistic tension but put that aside each action scene be watchable enough we don usually see wide blockbuster today that have the gut to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this this be probably the only mundane element exist in those set piece denzel washington shift his character to two personality one be the likable ordinary man himself and the anti hero with hidden cosmic hate through its world the performance do sum up the overall movie from gravitas to smugness and what great be they re both effective anyway however the villain and their tattoo have blatantly show that they re evil the main antagonist seem like he write to be over the top almost like cartoon villain than believable human mafioso but marton csokas give little grimness as he have fun with it the equalizer would have be nicer if it be little short and much consistent but could guarantee that it still entertain it do have the appeal through its action and act though there be more serious thing that could have make it lot compel thriller the film do have the knack of embrace either of its element but it just keep shift back and forth like we re not get to the actual big picture well if you can accept that the hero be this superior then it might work well for the experience for now it can be endlessly watchable but you will only find few thing that be remarkable about it
this be just great the story could have be bit well some of the cut 39 where just weird and the acting for some character be just very choppy but except for that it 39 a great movie 7 10
cold heartless horror movie treatment of one of the great epic story of our time really try to go into this movie with an open mind know that much would be leave out due to time restriction be aware through the promotional campaign that the dialog be go to be un tolkien for reason wasn clear about since they seem to have go to considerable effort to get pronunciation correct know that there would be many thing about both the story and the treatment of it that would conflict with my own hide bound some would say fossilized idea but still look forward to it then they show sauron in the second shot of the movie and somewhere inside wail in despair knew from that alone that peter jackson didn get it what be the one thing in lotr that be never show the one thing so evil and horrible that it isn even describe sauron the title character the lord of the ring himself there he be in the second shot of the movie some funny look big guy whose armourer have either very very bad taste or sick sense of humor the whole prologue be very aggravate to me because as watched it know that both the structure of the story and the slow building of understand that characterized tolkien telling of it be be ignore throughout the fellowship of the ring the book that be we see the story unfold largely through frodo eye we don know about the conspiracy between merry pippin and sam because frodo doesn we don know who the black rider be because frodo doesn and we don know the history of the ring until gandalf tell frodo about it put us in the hobbit shoe bring us into the story the prologue in the movie separate us from it on technical level the cinematography and edit be completely wrong for story of this type other than few wide sweep shot of the fellowship walk south from rivendell the movie seem all wide angle lenses swish pan jump cut spike lee zoom zoom in while dollying back or vice versa or gratuitous and excessive special effect when frodo put the ring on why do it suddenly get windy rather think bilbo would have notice something be odd about the ring if all that have happen when he put it on almost without exception all the special effect be over the top from the glow of the fiery letter shin on frodo face which will admit look kind of cool to the flame eye of sauron in word the film lack subtlety tolkien would have be hop mad and arwen at the bridge make me mad too in the book frodo stand weak and wound on the opposite shore from the nazgul and yet with his remain strength defy them this be crucially important moment in his development and our understanding of his character though the wave with horse be nice touch speaking of arwen at the bridge there be many annoy example of small change to the plot do for no apparent reason why be it frodo who figure out how to open the gate of moria and why wasn sam at the mirror of galadriel why do aragorn show up before the orcs finish off boromir actually that one obvious so we could waste more time with another damn fight scene that why and why be he not present when the black rider attack the hobbit at weathertop it be possible to transfer book successfully to screen faithfully for example harry potter and the sorcerer stone do an admirable job give the movie seven out of ten and full mark for keep within both the letter and the spirit of the book it leave some thing out but you could tell that the filmmaker respect the book the author and the book legion of reader several key dynamic from lotr be throw out in the movie the whole business of the mysterious disappearance of gandalf be leave out and replace with one of the most bone jarringly stupid scene in the film call it gandalf vs saruman in the temple of doom be that silliness necessary the wizard in the film may have be quick to anger but subtle they most decidedly be not the legolas gimli relationship be likewise ignore as well as the process of aragorn gain the hobbits trust especially sam but this simply underscore the great weakness in the movie it doesn build the character it take them for grant and what of poor barliman he be give such short shrift not to mention tom bombadil read viewer comment in this forum defend his omission which say quote here man who stop the hobbit be eaten very slowly by tree with his power of song be just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age that exactly the point lotr be not about this day and age by and large the casting be fine with the following exception agent smith from the matrix as elrond for god sake weave even slip in and out of the agent smith voice viggo mortenson as aragorn he be capable of play the fighter but either wasn capable or give the opportunity to reveal the historian linguist lore learn aragorn the interchangeable actor as merry and pippin except for their accent they weren easy to tell apart it easy to say that even at three hour the film be too short to cover all the ground in the book and will certainly not argue this estimate faithful yet watchable treatment at about 24 hour but ken burn baseball be almost that long wasn it but far too much of that precious time be spend in the action and fight scene the chamber of mazarbul scene the fight with the troll be one of the good action scene and handle very skillfully but would have trade most of it for well treatment of the council of elrond like why the heck be boromir there who be gimli and why be he at rivendell why wasn bilbo there his offer to take the ring be most revealing in the book and of course the whole prologue should have be move into frodo sit room where professor tolkien wisely put it it come down to this they didn trust the book the darned thing sell fifty million copy that a billion dollar worth of book and have legion of admirer dwarf harry potter but they didn trust it one of the thing truly admire about the late robert shaw sing in the atlanta symphony orchestra chorus be that he never try to put his own stamp on piece of music his purpose be always to get at the heart of the music to serve the composer and the composer intention in way film treatment of book be performance of that book and the good the book the more beloved by the reading public the more incumbent it be upon the performer to strive for the heart and soul of the book peter jackson get much that be superficially right but miss the life at the center the film be cold frightening and utterly unlike the lord of the ring finally the most disappointing thing because any lord of the ring film would have to be production of epic scale this version may have to stand as the only real attempt at film adaptation for many year perhaps forever there have be dozen of hamlet and even bunch of tarzan and that one thing that keep run through my mind this be it this be the treatment that lotr will get in the cinema damn
the getaway the last day of the pure action film before action become routine and bruce willis there be the 1970 action film which often have lot of mood the getaway be one of those film show what range the action film could have there be more than violence and wannabe cool dialog here this be before the action film become exaggerated instead of have just explosion and be over explicit there be booth plot and suspense in the getaway it let peckinpah use his well know style in the way of boorman point blank the result be pure ali mcgraw be say to be limit and stiff but peckinpah make her solid here guess that steve mcqueen never be good than here even if some wouldn agree some of peckinpah regular star such as ben johnson slim pickens bo hopkins and dub taylor which make it even well today the impact of peckinpah be powerful rating 8 of 10

weak script now you see me could have be good movie if only the writer team or should we say the lame duck team take the trouble to do their job correctly the story be just big little clear catch all riddle from end to end with quite flagrant incoherence and punctuate by probably one of the bad twist ever indeed this twist be ridiculous because totally unbelievable it doesn produce any effect on the viewer but most seriously it instantly annihilate the credibility of the film as whole and it seem like dream when just before morgan freeman serf us up with totally absurd and unrealistic demonstration have to explain an outcome above all in such didactic and unsubtle way prove well that the script doesn hold water this quite incredible failure of the story inevitably cripple the movie which anyway only possess two asset that be its dynamism and its cast except the unbearable mélanie laurent who make one grammatical mistake every three sentence and seem to be recite her line more than anything else and jesse eisenberg who seem stick in his zuckerberg role mumble all the time as for the cinematography it isn fundamentally bad but very cliché as the soundtrack with for example lot of circus shot technique leterrier use and abuse of apparently as little inspired as his writer
not even remotely as good as spinal tap it be funny spinal tap have much good music and be fake then real joke band cautionary tale about rock and roll band sure but we know how rocker act in the past we be all bore stiff half way in ughh if you be fan then great see it otherwise try to catch documentary of more relevant band not single person we know have ever hear of any these song by this group the production by netflix be sufficientl but the material brutally inconsequential we do wish them all well in their retirement
sober depiction of warsaw under german occupation the first thing that should be say be that this be most definitely more than holocaust movie although that dreadful event stand firmly in the background this movie be really about one man struggle for survival the one man be polish jewish pianist wladyslaw szpilman adrien brody play that lead role and he play it well szpilman come across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive brody portray him as man with great dignity it be challenge role because as the movie progress there less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except szpilman have be take by the nazis brody end up play long stretch without voice but it doesn stop him from render brilliant portrait of the man whose friend and family be go and who simply try to live day by day hop for way out of this madness just as haunt be extend scene in which director roman polanski simply show us devastate warsaw not just the jewish ghetto but other part of the city as well the scene of rubble the scene of innocent people be gun down in the street by german soldier sometimes just for sport without any other obvious reason the scene of burn out building it all haunt for all that and all that be very good there be something about the story that didn really click with me for some strange reason find it difficult to follow and do think that at almost two and half hour it be little bit too long as much as be accomplish in that running time could have be accomplish in two hour flat it a good movie but just fail to reach the level of greatness that some have assign to it 6 10

a monumental film feeling weary and battle worn have just stagger out of the cinema after three and half hour of special effect creature fight other special effect creature have take refreshment but barely touch them probably because the film have watch be one of the most mesmerising evocative inspiring and awesome have witness of any big adventure epic not to mention superb ensemble act mood that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battle of colossal proportion and convince bloodshed beauty and wonderment fantastic natural and artificial landscape and cityscape touch of humour well pace dramatic tension and human bonding that be move enough to just let you dry your eye as the unassuming credit flash by return of the king be the great of the tolkien trilogy by new zealand director peter jackson although ve see the other two and read the book felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn do either the storytelling be much more professional that the first one which maybe labour to introduce so much information or the second one which have little let up from the tension of long battle scene in return of the king there be an emotional sting at the start as we watch the transformation of gollum from warm fun love guy to murderous mutate wretch the movie then move deftly between different segment of the story the sadness of the lovely soft focus liv tyler as fated arwen whose travail and woman love succeed in have the sword that be break mend the comradeship of sam and frodo sean astin elijah wood that be test to the limit the strong commanding presence of gandalf ian mckellen who keep an eye on thing whilst turn in an oscar worthy performance the ingenious and very varied battle scene and the mythical city of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot element this be fairy story of human endeavour the defeating of power clique and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compare to wagner gotterdammerung it be fairy story without any sugary sweetness fairy story the like of which hasn be tell so well before and be even unlikely to be do so well in the future the haunting scream of the nasgul stay with you the physical attraction be not airbrush and the battle be about as far from pantomime character wave wooden sword as you can get the ingenious monster keep you on the edge of your seat the whole narrative maintain the spirit if not archival detailed accuracy of the original and make you want to read the book or read the book again the bad can say about it be that it be maybe tad long but not that you notice
cheesy clichéd completely unlikable protagonist full of cheesy dialogue clichéd situation try but can not like the young brother one bit some people be say the old brother be unlikable but to me that be the only character in the whole movie that doesn annoy me
a nothing movie this be one of those nothing movie that handful of people into art house kind of stuff might love but no one else will there be no plot it a string of loosely link scene and random effect often draw out and rarely with any dialogue in which woman hold very fake sound dialogue with various sleazy guy to lure them to her home except for sicko rapist who seem to be offer up as the hero of the story few people will claim that there be deep meaning in this movie and that people need to be insightful and deep thinking to see it the truth be that can be say for any semi randomly jam together series of image human mind naturally try to make sense of randomness doesn mean movie that play on that take skill time or effort to make and certainly doesn make it intelligent
the most underrated alien film and my personal favorite the original alien v predator film be my favorite alien movie note that didn say it be the best alien movie even wouldn dare call this good film than alien or alien but it be easily without doubt my personal favorite entry in the franchise it easily its most underrated entry far exceed the expectation of pg 13 crossover film with much more to offer than the intriguing premise of fight between 80s monster icon avp alien v predator be film make with surprising level of care in its characterization act performance theme and visual direction and it a far good film than it have any right to be of course that pg 13 rating will always be nuisance when deal with crossover between 2 legendarily brutal and violent film franchise you can tell the film be significantly hold back on its violence and while avp be still able to retain surprising sense of dread and suspense despite this can help but feel that there be truly scary movie underneath all the heavy censorship the action scene while impressive do tend to get somewhat ridiculous and nonsensical at time not kong skull island nonsensical nowhere near that level but still somewhat silly the beautiful sanaa lathan performance as lex wood be absolutely incredible in fact may actually prefer her performance and character to ripley of the original series she command such powerful screen presence and authority on her vocal delivery and her facial acting be beyond exceptional lathan be an incredibly convince crier and scene that require her to be emotionally torment or horrify be some of the best performed in the entire franchise lathan arc from cautious bystander helpless to save her teammate from violent death to strong warrior couldn be write well and lathan switch in the 3rd act into more angry fearless character be perform with such passion and conviction fully believe that this be the kind of battle test fighter who could take on an alien queen with nothing but spear and chain by the end of the film avp be noticeably interested in the concept of how leader watch from the sideline while hero out their life on the line against even the most insurmountable odds of failure lex begin leader and end hero largely through witness the strength of her employer weyland speaking of lance henrikson recently discuss in my review of pumpkinhead be almost as excellent as the age industrialist charles weyland he subvert much of the expectation one would have for this kind of character billionaire industrialist and descendant of the notoriously ruthless michael weyland bishop be fearless proactive bold and motivating and henrikson do wonderful job capture the age weyland strength humanity and never say die spirit his noble sacrifice to help lex and sebastian escape be genuinely saddening moment but no other end would seem more appropriate for such hero big reason why love avp so much be its theme of sacrifice and just how selfless and sacrifice these character be lex weyland and sebastian all seemingly ordinary people be fully ready to give their life for one another on the expectation that the same would be do for them there a real camaraderie to them sense of heroism that not only lack in most cast of the alien film but in the cast of most team ensemble in general even the seemingly ruthless predator scar go through rather satisfy arc from lone wolf to loyal and sacrifice hero through his time spend witness alex heroism odd as it sound his borderline romantic interaction with lex be genuinely satisfy there a weird chemistry there in sort of beauty the beast kind of way and both sanna lathan and ian whyte play it surprisingly well in their body act also kudos to avp for be the first predator film to actually give us predator with personality in the oddly comedic scar small character moment like his prank on lex or his cocky scoff at ferocious chestburster be rather charm the special effect work be still stun to this day those who watch the film now may be surprise at just how much practical effect work be do on this project rather than cgi and it certainly pay off the predator and alien hardly ever look fake yet the film never have to sacrifice much in the way of speed to make their fight look natural it get to the point where almost have to look for shot of them that look bad m no paul s anderson fan but his visual direction here be absolutely incredible the dusty shadowy hall of the ancient temple maze work much in the same manner as an especially effective haunt house gothic claustrophobic and with the added danger of constantly shift surroundings make escape almost impossible the very limited use of music and nail biting sense of tension and pacing that anderson stag his kill with be as chilling and creepy as those of any rated alien film anderson shot of the majestic seemingly endless expanse of antarctica have such beauty even an artistry to them they almost feel more out of discovery nature documentary than an alien or predator film avp alien v predator be nowhere near the disaster it make out to be nor be it the brainless soulless video game it be unfairly malign as it well act have strong character and theme gorgeous direction and excellent cinematography for my money it the 3rd best alien film it certainly 100 time good than either of the pretentious nonsensical alien prequels that ridley scott crank out m picking paul s anderson over ridley scott hell be have snow day
over hype and not over quick enough this be one of the bad film have ever see only steven speilberg could take an astonishing story of courage and determination in the face of hideous oppression and turn it into poorly make schmaltz fest like this chief in series of tacky amateurish filming technique be the legendary girl in red coat have decide on black and white in an attempt to show that he can be serious about something the paucity of spielberg imagination be clear in that he can think of no other way to make the girl stand out and be recognise he seem to think that his audience be incapable of recognise say face and have to hammer home the identity of the girl by present her in an entirely different way from everybody else in the film the monumental cheesiness of the closing scene with the people save by schindler go way beyond the point of tackiness just more evidence of spielberg extraordinarily sentimental side sabotage what should have be meaningful film on the plus side most of the acting be superb but on the whole the film sensationalises the violence and oppression which it should have set out to attack oskar schindler be such an extraordinary man that his remarkable story which everybody should know deserve far far good than this
hardly worth the money well the story be just dull simply find it as normal as it get and totally predictable the fact that po just simply find way to realize the marshal art by think about it and call it destiny be none sense for any marshal art the worrier need to practice and maybe in old age they will find inspiration so they can realize the true art and have the break through otherwise you be some kind of genius and very suitable to practice marshal art and learn something from special scroll or something then you can learn the true art in the first movie at least shifu somehow find way to train po so he become strong in the end still ridiculous but acceptable in the second story that part of the story be just so thin and taichi just suddenly fall in onto the lab and he become the master of it ok if you just simply for laugh and try to watch the cute panda it be ok however what you have not see in the second movie that be not in the first one the story be not funny anymore panda be the same as before and the whole thing really just rush all way to the end the parent son relationship be pretty thin as well really enjoy the first movie and now find the second one disappointment again watch in big screen may give the movie few positive point and really no point to watch it again on small screen
i be look forward to this movie very much be very much look forward to this movie the prospect of film base on the discovery of sutton hoo star ralph fiennes and carey mulligan sound like the perfect combination and it start out promisingly with wonderfully rich period detail and stunning scenery it become clear at once that this be movie for the patient viewer with its deliberate english dramatic pacing where it begin to fall short for me be when it become apparent that there be go to be very little do with the fact that sutton hoo be perhaps the most significant archaeological site in britain and its discovery and what be learn from it be an amazing tale some of that could have be weave into the narrative just bit otherwise there be very little interpretive value in the film and while it be drama the story of the main character which be tell with bit of artistic license be not very compelling or interest the side plot of minor character even less so the magnitude of the discovery to me be not successfully convey in this movie which be shame in the end it be good british period drama with solid act adequate writing high production value and beautiful cinematography that just never quite get to the point it should and could have for folk who be not fan of british slow burn television it will be mind numbingly bore
be that all there be this be just well photographed variation on chinatown the story be too contrived and needlessly complicate clean up the storyline would have cut forty five minute from the bloat running time and why wasn james cromwell nominate for best support actor his work be the highlight of the whole film the low point be kim basinger way over rat performance there be more acting do by the excellent costume than by m she be adequate but didn do anything with the part that dozen other actress could have do
meh be really look forward to watch this movie but the first 1 3 of the movie be completely boring and struggle to get engross with the character the movie seem more stupid than funny m happy if there a balance but it seem awkward and just plain unfunny with everything altogether
painfully bore this movie be horrible watched and watched and nothing really happen there be so many artistic scene where nothing happen almost fell asleep if you do watch this have your thumb ready to go on the fast forward button there plenty of fluff to skip over very poorly direct movie
good than expect be gon na skip it all the standard 2 star review because it a remake but it fun good way to pass the time haven see original forever but 80s movie generally don date as well as you remember so check it out

a big disappointment couple of year ago when heard peter jackson would direct two more middle earth movie start cry out of excitement those two movie soon get change into three and be angry because be convince the story be too short for three three hour long movie despite the book be approximately 300 page long peter jackson co prove me wrong and manage to not include big part of the book in these movie even though there more than 8 5 hour of total screen time disappoint be an understatement don think this movie be suppose to make me laugh at the serious scene and sigh at the comic relief scene basically everything alfrid be in but sadly it do at least the funny scene in the lord of the ring trilogy be subtle and less in number botfa be suppose to be serious and dark and those silly ridiculous scene pretty much ruin that have nothing negative to say about the act though the amazing cast of this trilogy do the best they could with the awful script they be give and m thankful for that it not their fault that their character development be rush because the movie be full of pointless legolas vs gravity scene dull tauriel scene who fell in love with kili after have conversation with him once or twice same go for kili who fell in love with her and even give her the token his mother dís give him the bad part of this movie isn even that it full of badly do cgi or the big lack of proper character development it the fact that tauriel badly write impossible character make up by peter jackson co have more screen time than character who be in the actual book write by r tolkien beorn basically get fifteen second if not less screen time in the last installment of this trilogy most of the dwarf from the company barely get line and lot of thing be leave unexplained spoiler after this linefor instance what happen with thranduil and the white gem do he ever get them back what happen to the gold as fan of the book already know the answer but the movie didn really care to explain this important part of the story come on the entire battle be about the gold at least take minute to explain how it get divide where do those goat suddenly come from why be the dwarf wear helmet when they be still inside the mountain but have no helmet on when they actually go to war what happen to the people of lake town why didn the movie explain that bard become king of dale if have not read the book d get really annoy after watch this movie and not know what have happen to them what be the point of those ridiculously large worm and why do no one else ever mention them before and why be they go after ten second do they ever get kill why mention legolas mother and never explain anything about her at all besides all these unanswered question there be certain thing which bother me more than all of those question combine 1 the durins thorin kili fili didn get funeral in my opinion it ridiculous to cut something like that out because they be basically the main character which bring me to my second point 2 think peter jackson forget that this story be call the hobbit because bilbo be suppose to be the main character not thorin 3 kili basically sacrifice himself for tauriel which be unforgivable in the actual story fili and kili die defend thorin in battle now the poor boy be dead because he have crush on badly write elf which also completely degrade the importance of legolas and gimli friendship let not forget about the scene wherein legolas grab fly bat or when bard use his son bain to shoot an arrow which should make him fall but somehow it doesn or when dain and thorin decide to hug in the middle of battle or when azog somehow manage to float and dramatically open his eye absolutely love the lord of the ring trilogy they be my favorite movie of all time and the reason become fan of tolkien work in the first place it sad that peter jackson desperately try to link the hobbit movie to the lotr trilogy because it partly the reason why the hobbit movie be so awful if the unnecessary dol guldur scene and the tauriel storyline be skip every good part from the book which be now cut out would have easily fit in m still give this movie 4 out of 10 though because absolutely love the cast and think they do brilliant job especially richard armitage and martin freeman also the very last scene be exactly like imagine it would be with ian holm bilbo and gandalf knocking on the door love that part and the last goodbye by billy boyd be beautiful way to end this movie and trilogy and make me tear up you might enjoy this movie if you really like the first two didn if you re into bad cgi or movie that look like video game or if you don really care about tolkien middle earth and be content with movie that doesn do tolkien and his character justice at all otherwise you re probably someone like me and you ll leave the theater disappoint and grieve over the character you love so much
horrible great cast terribly miscast love every major actor in this film but the miscasting be legendary liam neeson be so badly miscast that you can see him try to play the part of hannibal right from the start and do so in unconvincing fashion he doesn fit the part and face sorry great actor but he not the lady man you know there be go to be problem when the strong member of the group be the non actor ba and he not great murdoch just total lamer the miscasting be evident without see the prior history this story have see as remake that didn need to be remake it a disgrace the imdb rating be badly overblown and most generously above 6 if you go to other site you ll see far low rating and for good reason this be unfortunately poor movie watch at your own risk the opening of the film waste time on mediocre back story and then it pad run time with the team envision success needlessly all the famous line be use to recreate the character but so poorly that all you can think be it insert name actor here artificially utter the line make famous in trademark style the team go into baghdad and let the ridiculous bravado begin don say you weren warn

an inaccurate movie but good acting be ok up with this film up until the point where geli come in and then it all go down from there in order to demonify hitler they make it seem like he be control bastard and geli be scar of him and think him crazy anyone who have do any study on this subject should know that geli be completely in love with him and even stag suicide attempt to get him to notice her more when he meet eva she couldn take it anymore the fact that he wasn with her all the time and really kill herself out of despair and depression not because he be treat her cruelly and be monster this really make me laugh that someone would go and change history so blatantly so it can fit their own concept of an evil maniacal hitler in no way be support hitler or what he do but historian be suppose to portray history in an objective and impartial manner something that seem hard for filmmaker with their own agenda to do thought robert carlyle be very good in his role as be the other actor actress
my 12 year old brother enjoy this film however do not we all know the fast and furious 6 franchise have become less and less about the car over the series so there be no point in moan about that now as an action pack film and the occasional race which forcefully become relevant to the story fast and furious 6 be great however the realism of this film be just dreadful star war be more believable when yoda come back as ghost notice three loophole in the story myself that while my friend sit next to me tap me on the shoulder every 10 second to point out another cliché if you have see the other film in this series then you can pretty much work out for yourselves what be go to happen grow up with this series really want to leave good review but just can overall if you enjoy the other film just want an action pack film and can leave your brain at the door then this movie be great but it will leave the more hardcore film fan laugh at how they could write and direct good film in their sleep
dull after the explosive end of kill bill volume 1 this movie be major let down grant volume 1 take while to get go but once it get fire there be no stop it or so thought don care what anyone say this film be series of sequence that be in desperate need of edit this movie just go on and on and on its mess actually this film have only one problem and that it insist on fill fill in the blank concern every single character whether it move the plot or not several of these sequence could be so much short but quentin instead insist on let them play out until you want to snooze bad this film insist on copy god know how many film style flaw the first film over come most of the style didn need to have them pay homage will not discuss the end which go on to the point of boredom dislike it and ll leave it at that perhaps this will play well as see as one long 5 hour film but doubt it

overrate film of the century already first of all most people who praise this film do not read the book the book be amaze but can not work as film maybe that be why no one have undertake this epic until now what can understand be how people can praise all the different aspect of it the costuming and set be the only thing decent my complaint too many liberty be take with the book now m not refer to the plot element which be more or less intact except for tom bombadil if you don know who that be read the book but the style that tolkien work so hard to preserve in all of his book the first item that be ruin in the first 5 minute be the mystery of sauron sauron be such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him tolkien keep this throughout all the book jackson ruin that in 5 minute next the action always follow the hobbit this put you in the place of the hobbit what character would be good for an audience to identify with they be as much outsider to this strange world as we be unfortunately jackson ruin that also the directing be nothing spectacular it be unobtrusive but there be no style really so it do not add any more depth to the movie the acting be pretty good but it could not save the movie from the unforgivable sin that the movie commit to the book the special effect though praise be not good at all you think since they have to do 3 film with hobbit that they would come up with good way to do them and stick to it not the case the hobbit change size drastically throughout the film depend on the technique that be be use to reduce them sometimes they be child but the bad be when they just put them far from the camera how be that suppose to work although we do not have depth perception in the theater the audience can still tell when the size difference be only create by the perspective the cg effect be not outstanding but after see star war episode 1 it be nice to know costume can still be use well now if have not read the book would have good view of this film you bet but too many thing from the book be ruin to make it more of conventional movie even still definitely would not think it be worthy of be rank so high on imdb com
like the story couldn connect with the player primal fear have very well write story which target very fundamental question that we all be struggle with in our life what be right and what be wrong be it justified to do something immoral to achieve right goal almost every character in this movie be deal with this question and they choose to go in different direction my main criticism to the movie be the cast richard gere be play the main role and laura linney be the main actress they both be very wonderful actor but believe they be not suitable choice for the role in this movie for example the character richard gere be play be passionate arrogant lawyer that would suite good to someone like al pacino or paul newman

the inflated god awful dwindle as ve have the sound track for many year finally take the opportunity to watch the movie my initial response be that this movie seem so sliced and dice it make the editing of manos the hand of fate look like brain surgery by comparison my guess be that malcolm mclaren have multiple can of sex pistol footage lie around and be have difficult time try to make film out of it to get his creative juice flow he cut segment from every reel roll them up snort line of cocaine with them and finally tell julian temple to fix that bit of film with this bit just use whilst in the process the coke inflate mclaren ego and he come up with the idea to make the incomplete who kill bambi into documentary explain how he orchestrate everything this movie try so hard to be clever instead it just seem immature and uninspired all there be go on be that we have band member do dumb thing mclaren claim credit though without any proof back up anything he say and some decent footage of sex pistol show some many year later the film be pretty much confirm as lie in that time mclaren wasn know to repeat the same method and end up with the same result these day this film be consider tongue in cheek mockumentary instead of pile of crap so there really be no reason to make this film other than money the only value this film have be that it contain archival footage other than that it really didn need to be tell in the fictitious tale of mclaren it would ve do good if it be narrate to the audience like it be scrapbook but because it tell in such fictitious manner the audience be leave possibly irritated or numb d give it 8 10 because it contain decent live footage of band love but d give it 3 10 because the movie be lie so poorly edit and present to the audience that it be suppose to be an actual film meet in the middle at 5 10
all the 1 review be bandwagon it not that bad 5 1 2 okay crap script serious problem with that but some good acting beautiful set nicely shoot good special effect if you want to see fantasy movie and you have see all the good one this be worth spin load of action well choreograph the trailer movie on the dvd imply you be an idiot man who like to watch movie for the boob and violence which doesn set the mood admit but there be no exploitation of woman in this movie and some of the woman even take up sword so okay this isn shakespeare if fact prepare thyself for character arc that be vapid and almost theme less it basically medieval supernatural revenge tale but if you re just look for no brainer fix of non dragon fantasy and action especially on weekend afternoon you will enjoy this jason be excellent

superficial man utter dross devoid of character humour and even colour the cgi be the usual fantastical arbitrary nonsense we have all have to endure in modern time fill out the last third of an overlong movie with week script so full of hole and non existent character it make you want to weep as an utterly superficial entity imagine nonetheless it will score highly among pre pubescent kid adhd sufferer dullard and the easily entertain too cool for school zero expression who be superman even the pretty amy adam can save this one for me

supercowboy be dead long live the superhero deglamorising the unfashionable western genre by the culprit that have reanimate the cadaver some decade previous except the final shootout this representation omit the unshootable the character that could walk through the volley of dozen gatling gun and survive instead we re almost treat to something that may be close to reality but even then there be leap of faith and character that we probably wouldn recognise in ourselves or those we know although clint eastwood play himself he always do that why we watch his film ultimately it draw line in the sand where the hero of the silver screen replace leather chap and suede for lycra and cape guess mask be common theme be we sad to see them go sooner or later you run out of originality in the real world and in order to perpetuate something new and engage the unreal world be the only place to go especially when cgi can make it feel so real
horrendous what an utter waste of time be by no mean die hard advocate of direct adaptation of book to the screen so enter the cinema expect an enjoyable movie with solid cinematography great storyline and good acting to be expect with the director boy be mistake grant the movie be extremely far fetched next to no authenticity in relation to the book of the bible what kill it for me be the serious inconsistency with the character profile poor storyline and execution that make me want to leave the cinema midway for example noah be portray as an earth love greenie protecting plant and life point understood but he easily kill people to protect another life far later in the story he be battle internal turmoil as they hear the scream of the people of the earth if his resolve lead him to kill human without hesitation why be his suddenly so challenged there be no clear cut message no point to the movie and it seem to drag on if the director intend to slide off in tangent at least make it excite to watch let me save you the waste of time and advise against watch it save your precious penny and watch some worth your time
violent yes good zombie 90 be zero budget movie make by german director andreas schnaas this be the guy who also have movie series call violent t this be one of those straight to video movie that be very common around this time where anyone could buy camcorder and make movie the special effect arnt completely horrible but thanks to the awful light most of the time the blood look like strawberry milk cant judge the dialog write or act because the dubbers obviously do not follow the script at some point you can hear the dubbers laugh the intentionally bad dubbing be hilarious though and be the only redeeming factor of this movie in my opinion and to top it off this movie have no end you will have to see it to know what mean if you want few laugh then recommend this movie but if you want serious horror movie look somewhere else
not terrible but not worthy successor to daze and confuse as fan of dazed and confuse when find out about this film be ecstatic but it just doesn deliver really want it to be great but it never really get there the character be mostly forgettable and not even overly likable at time it seem like bad copy of dazed and confuse with line like that what m talk about repeat and character such as the coach who seem like carbon copy of the assistant coach from daze and confuse and finnegan who seem very much like an attempt to replicate mcconaughey wooderson it set in the 80s but there really isn an 80s experience here like daze and confuse deliver daze and confuse give us look at the car and some of the iconic thing about the 70 as well as experience that give the viewer look at what be teen in the 70s may have be like but everybody want some never really deliver any of that the performance here aren bad with the exception of one character who to me seem like parody and it not terrible movie it just lack the magic of dazed and confused and in the end it really just flat film that never really get the viewer excite or delivers of course this be just my opinion and you may really enjoy it so check it out yourself and form your own opinion because it at least worth see once
powerful but uneven have history of generally avoid animate film just due to block that prevents me from invest in artificial character but d be lie if say up didn touch me within the first half hour be in river of my own tear and there be several other time the film get me choke up the relationship between carl and ellie be beautiful and sweet and whenever they pull on those string well it really work for me it unfortunate that the rest of the film wasn that good instead they mix in this beautiful and heartbreaking story of an elderly man all alone with very dull and standard villain plot disappointingly standard after the great uniqueness in his mean of transportation and the most annoying sidekick since short round admire the parallel between carl and russell and get plenty of laugh out of this but it wasn excite at all for relatively short film it drag lot and the moment that it drag be the one that be suppose to be the most exciting couldn have care less about everything with muntz and so the big action piece have me zone out frequently up start off with very somber adult tone with the introduction to carl that really respect but the more thing they add onto it just make that tone lot more muddled and awkward they go for lot of different tone and don think they pull them together very well still have to admire it so some degree just by virtue of how much it pull on my heart string there be lot of tear and quite few laugh just wish the good hadn be bogged down by so much ordinary
what can say felt anything for this movie except for when kidman get naked wow she keep that body in shape those 3 star be for kidman

you shoot me in dream you good wake up and apologize tarantino 39 brutal debut film from the original initial dialogue to the final outcome the director astonish everyone and make clear his style anthological dialogue pay attention to the discussion in the distribution of color that will identify each gangster hilarious breakthrough structure very good soundtrack as in all his film great dos of violence although not at all gratuitous but rather ironic and above all lot of black humor in addition to superb performance by harvey keitel tim roth michael madsen steve buscemi and chris penn in short great example of good noir cinema with all its ingredient shooting violence betrayal suspense etc but with the innovative and very personal touch of the brilliant director who would later continue to dazzle with the wonderful quot pulp fiction quot oh and the scene from the begin with quot little green bag quot be legendary 10 10
a cult cinema star be bear ll start off by say that love this movie m sure there will be huge critical backlash against it which be too bad because it be the sort of movie that be very rare these day know who kill me be cult camp classic in the making and will hopefully be recognize as such saw this movie last night in san francisco everyone in the audience seem to be have good time but when we be leave the theater overheard lot of people say thing like be laugh the whole time it be so bad honestly m pretty baffle as to what these people expect when they go see movie like this and have that reaction from all the publicity saw for this movie can see how anyone could justify think that it be go to be some sort of high art psychological thriller in the vein of the shining or vertigo be sort of afraid that it would be another one of those mediocre thriller that take themselves too seriously murder by number premonition but instead be delight the movie have real sense of humor about itself and do not disappoint when it come to absurd twist and turn and moment of glorious camp fan of grindhouse evil dead and of rob zombie movie will probably be win over by this movie miss lohan should be proud of herself for her work in this despite her recent legal trouble her role in this film give me hope that she could have fruitful career ahead of her if she play her card right the first part of the movie in which miss lohan play over achiever aubrey fleming be probably the weak section it have some entertaining part like the strip tease from the creepy gardener character but overall it be hard to think of lindsay lohan as straight student from small town america however the movie as well as miss lohan performance take strong turn for the best when she transform into dakota moss the sassy stripper with troubled past even though the day of mean girl have long past we be remind that miss lohan have great comedic timing and strong screen presence the character of dakota have very appealing bluntness and miss lohan be perfect at portray this she and rise mcgowan be certainly in close competition for the title of cult cinema queen but unlike ms mcgowan m lohan be truly talented actress hope to see her in more movie like this although don want to spoil the end will say that the final scene after we know who the killer be be downright hilarious also this movie have one of the best final shot ve see in long time if you re fan of camp ridiculous gore general absurdity and sick of generic hollywood thriller with no sense of humor then know who kill me will be real treat for you

earth to echo review the movie earth to echo be very creative movie and wasn just like every other cliché movie with alien in it there be few part that do remind me of another movie but besides the one or two part that contain something that remind me of another movie it be original the editing in the movie be very commendable and the part that show echo sight be also creative and commendable in the movie there be three boy who be best friend who be force to move out because of road be make right above their home few day before they have to home out one of their phone start to show map they all decide to go to where the map be and they end up find an alien who need help to get back home my opinion on this movie be that it be very creative and like how it wasn just like every other alien movie it have interesting plot and the special effect creative the end be slightly easy to guess but the story itself be very creative and the movie be very interesting

sub par pixar pixar be get lazy this movie be the second bland generic pixar release this year the other be soul neither of these movie come close to capture the magic of pixar at its best the incredibles wall toy story 3 instead fall back on the kind of meaningless platitude you might find on those inspirational poster you see hang on the wall in work place or those cross stitch message hang on the wall at grandma house onward be the blah blah story about young man who think he lack in all these quality that he then realize in the course of journey he really have inside him all along all could think about while watch this movie be the end of the stage musical urinetown where the heroine tell all the townspeople living in world without water that the the glass of water they crave have be inside them all along then they all die of thirst grade
a thorough analysis of the 2008 financial collapse with an oxymoronic title one would think that in the absolute least it would be extremely difficult to make an intriguing movie about the housing market and the us banking system and the greedy people who invest and gamble with our country future while keep cyber age audience entertain but the big short not only manage to accomplish that goal but do it excellently the major drawback to this film be that the pace be too fast for an average viewer to sort out who who from host of actor each of whom portrays key player in complex intertwine financial system that be say this film target the painful nerve of every american nerve that careen through their job security affect their monetary value and terminates in the core of their family welfare the place they cherish and call their home for every man home be his castle and whoever mess with man castle be mess with the man family the repressed anger of the american people over the 2008 crisis and the memory of the financial loss they have endure will be inflate as they watch this film and then prick by the irritating aggravating and infuriating outcome those who plan to watch it should plan on watch it twice and plan to clench lead bullet between the back teeth
it finally come but sadly just go star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning after concert at springfield lake where the band green day nearly drown due to the pollution there lisa start campaign to save the local environment and in so do cross path with charm young irish boy who she fall in love with meanwhile bart once again grow resentful of homer bad parenting skill and when he start to show more attention to pig he rescue from krusty burger he turn to next door neighbour ned for guidance it this pig that kick the main part of the plot off as homer selfishly dump silo he be use to store it waste in sl and cause major environmental catastrophe this cause the epa to drop massive dome around springfield and when the townspeople find out it homer fault they all turn out to lynch him the family manage to escape to alaska but homer selfishness drive everyone away once again and realize he stand to lose everything that matter to him homer hot foot it back to springfield to sort out the mess he create and patch thing up with his loved one when the simpson first appear as tiny sketch show on the tracey ullman show in 1987 it be hard to imagine that twenty year later it would be the most successful cartoon and lasting cartoon show ever more so than the bug bunny cartoon from warner brother in the 1950s and finally movie be make about it really get it into my head that tonne of praise would be heap upon it with five star review come leave and right but most critic simply lament how average the movie turn out to be struggle to give it any more than about three star and m afraid speaking as long time fan of the show can kind of see their point it be ten year in the making and it testament to how difficult it be to make that it wasn out by the time the show be at the height of it success in the 90s but one episode take six month to make so film be always go to be tricky no matter how great the demand for it but unfortunately that may be big part of the problem the show still very popular but not as much as the time when it be really cut edge especially for cartoon series and not afraid to poke fun at sensitive subject in the news and around the world at the time the movie play it too safe keep the clever gag down to take pot shot at well know film include titanic an inconvenient truth independence day night of the living dead and disaster film from the 70s as well as celebrity cameo from the like of green day arnold schwarzenegger and tom hank the plot struggle to endure the 80 minute run time without solid narrative flow and bit incoherent the crack start to show quite early on as you notice what work well for half an hour can quite translate to feature length film have be dedicate and loyal fan of the show for over ten year now finally see the simpson movie be something can only compare to finally have sex really something really build myself up for only to be leave to be honest bit disappointed
not bad little thin on interest level but watchable talk about thin matthew do go to the limit with his method act here ve see more meat on jockey whip but that what he have to do to make an essentially weak film hold your attention think jennifer garner be bit of cardboard cut out as be all of the medical staff but the guy at the bar be pretty convince anytime they show texas in movie m hook so m go to watch til the end even if the dust turn to mud as it do in the latter part of this show the cast guy in hollywood have draw big blank with fed lately and this gang be just as hollow as the other big movie mind you do work with lot of them in my time and lot of them be ungulate like these character could be they do it on purpose be it just me or be the movie replace cigarette with cocaine these day and promote it as lifestyle there must be some sort of policy change go on to legalize it and collect tax as the last three movie ve see have the protagonist snort it through garden hose american hustle the wolf of wall street etc it seem to be an essential part of any plot if you want it to get on the screen must live very sheltered life because none of the people know do it mind you live in an old people home so before they bring me my pill should summarize pretty lightweight stuff we all know that the fda be taint organization but the script could have do well job with the material at hand prefer matthew in his lawyer or handsome brute role this be stray too far from his paydirt the rest of the cast could have come from one of those csi show that never watch
safe family fun don really see what the big deal be about this movie it start out promise but be pretty bore throughout the last 40 minute will admit that all set prop and costume be do with painstaking detail the pirate be colorful entertaining lot act be okay depp be amuse and fake winona be nice eye candy there be some wickedly funny moment but plenty of stale one liner and repeat gag as well they be the kind of cheap shot at humor that can be sure to have the audience roll on the floor as long as the movie have already rope them in by then the end be naturally cheesy and draw out for way too long although not as bad as some pirate still have plenty of plot hole for party pooper like myself to pick at spoiler ul li when one ship board another as the english do when chasing sparrow and turner do they really send every single person over to the other ship wouldn it make sense to keep at least handful of people on your own ship li ul ul li why do sparrow steal coin from the trunk near the end of the movie in the end it just need to be toss back in anyway be it just so that he could whip it out for drama sake ah ha stole this coin li ul ul li if sparrow have be under the curse the whole time then wouldn he also suffer from the lack of sensory pleasure he certainly still enjoy rum li ul ul li have think that the hero would break the curse right as the pirate be walk along the bottom of the sea very neat scene by the way they would have all instantly become mortal and then immediately drown be disappoint when they instead wait another 30 minute let the ghost pirate kill several dozen people first fight the immortal pirate themselves for another 10 minute and then break the curse blown opportunity for neat end li ul end spoilers the special effect be good but that not enough nowadays to carry movie be try to figure out how this movie pull off an imdb 8 out of 10 here my theory the promotion for pirate successfully scar off the vast majority of would be critic the trailer and ad have disney and bruckenheimer splash all over and that be enough to insure that only the sure sell would actually pay to see it in theater be predict that pirate will not age very well and the rating will slip over time down to about 7 overall give pirate 6 10 worth see at least once perhaps be outgrow the action adventure genre
idealistic yet realistic definition of love often find myself knowingly go back to toxic relationship regardless of it be romantic etc after high low may follow and it absolutely crush me to know that will go back to them regardless sometimes wonder what it would be like to leave them completely but that only last second and know that be go back to them because when it be good it be extremely good want nothing else until the day die than to spend time with them this remind me of the girl use to like the day meet her ex realise do not even deserve to like this girl anymore saw how much they be miss each other yet not make single move because they know they would be toxic to each other know that know that could never make this girl happy the way her ex do good time be good it just that it suck they be follow by some awful time at time love be such weird feeling though doubt that have ever experience it all know for now be that once you earn it it should not be easy for it to be take away from you it would also be very lucky of me to have experience it in my life time

direct by captain obvious for kid first oblivion have great cast and look wonderful the post apocalyptic setting be one of the best ve ever see it beautiful and cool tough and bit epic sound especially the sound effect of the drone be equally great maybe the sound of the drone be actually the best thing of the whole film yes they be however that it the story be messy with ton of irregularity it doesn stick to it own logic realism and be very obvious you will know what go to happen next you can even tell what line they re go to say it that obvious this make it bite boring at place especially the whole dream sequence which the film maker for some reason seem force to show you ten time be tired shot that doesn add anything to the film at all yes we understand the concept in the first frame now get on with it yes it a summer blockbuster movie but it so dumbed down that it feel like the title should be obvious for dummy instead it base on graphic novel which haven read but the film use re hash from immortal also graphic novel from the 80 a 2004 feature film the fallout game and bit of matrix thrown in for the mystery moon of course it a pretty stupid film though even though it entertain at part if it be low budget feature with no know name wouldn complain but this be major sci fi with 120m budget question be why didn they spend at least few hundred buck on script that be air tight watch this with your brain turn off
fake movie all around wow where do begin with my disappointment not only be the dog fake cgi generate but the majority of the film be shoot on set and the nature scene and blowing snow be computer animation maybe the producer should ve spent less money on detach walk through role by harrison ford and actually shoot the film in the wild as the title suggest would ve enjoy it good if it be cartoon movie altogether the author of this story jack london tell story of man and dog v nature and the cold reality of the frozen north the movie fail to make us viewer understand the gist of london message the dog be portray as human like in their thinking and action much like disney lion king aberration along the way many part of of the great london novel be alter or remove most significantly the sled pulling gamble scene that be so important to the book also the film hero john thornton portray lackadaisically by ford meet his fate by manner completely different than what happen in the book do not see this movie unless you be under the age of 12 or if you want to take the kiddy to film simply awful almost walk out

too chaotic to love or hate feel like paprika be almost criticism proof any bad thing have to say about it can be attribute to intention the dialog be poor plot point pop out of nowhere and logic be throw out the window but this all seem to be add to the mood dream like movie that doesn follow reality but just don see the point of this accomplishment its weird for the sake of be weird so that leave no impression on me it could have be any random assortment of image and be just as effective can love movie through mood alone at least it be an interesting sit with fine animation and plenty of bizarre action if you re into this kind of style over subsistence then you may love it for me its more forgettable than amaze
it okay the acting be good it will keep you engaged lot of different spin to keep the movie interesting
mediocre but it about ethic so it ll be praise first off the situation prison exist with inmate pair in cell single food platform move down each day and you only get what the people above leave so the low you get the more likely you be to starve each month the inmate be randomly shuffle to different level if your cellmate dy you get new one in the shuffle now great it metaphorical but it the kind of plot that have that hitch right from the start this would never happen be approve or continue to operate ok whatever suspend disbelief and go with it which you have to because no explanation be ever offer except the people run it don care and cellmate 2 show us people work for the organisation don even know the full extent the main character go in voluntarily show that outsider have no knowledge of how it operate despite prisoner be release after their sentence for 6 month in exchange for degree degree in what never mention how be in prison be somehow degree never mention the movie just leave so many important fact completely unaddressed because they know it so nonsensical that they could never offer satisfactory explanation so the last section of the film have the main character and cellmate 3 rid the platform down to the bottom share out food equally find most of the low layer dead and attempt to keep panna cotta intact as message to the admin that they protest really fail to see how that send any form of message at all full platform maybe but oh hey we didn eat one thing be pretty dull protest at the bottom they find child and fee her the panna cotta and send her back up on the platform instead so your message be we can ride the platform up you think people didn try that it a kid so magically they ll grow conscience and everyone let out overall it just such poor attempt at be deep and questioning moral but because it really artsy everyone will rave about it wish people have well standard for movie than just have it try to make statement in nonsensical boring way
predictable and dull cumberbatch play alan turing well but felt he be give almost same persona as he play in sherlock his mannerism be almost identical this be where most of the laugh in the film come from and as have see sherlock before hand 70 felt like dull repeat the fact that nobody be friend with him just remind me of sherlock this be not true in real life secondary the plot be almost identical to every other movie about genius turring be play as unrecognized and an oddball the plot also felt too smooth edge all the twist be predictable and the event be too coincidental to be believable the spy subplot be unnecessary and add nothing to the story this may sound pedantic but some part seem out of place for the historical set the detective too modern haircut and line such as ohh my gosh which really bring me out of the story finally the end scene be unnecessary and should have cut straight to the end line speaking of which the last line infer that the two thing mention be link but they be in fact month apart this be an example of the film unreasonable twisting of fact in order to give the plot and conclusion this type of film need should you wish to find out the real story of alan turing suggest you google it as this film be not very accurate and unfairly stereotype turring
brilliantly narrate visually stun polanski have depict the gory detail of the holocaust without much restraint but the most wonderful aspect of the film be that the director have not lose focus of his story and instead of focus too much on the holocaust horror he have weave the true life narrative of survival around devillish happening every single act of escapade szpilman go through be depict like drop of water on barren desert however the oasis in the dry desert come in the end and it be here that polanski capture the essence of human emotion have this very strong urge of jump into the theater screen and magically adopt character in the movie and do something about the helplesness portray so convincingly overall polanski have give stun visual narrative of the cold war survival indeed be privilege though it be take for grant today performance by brody kretschmann deserve applause pawel edelman camera work be move and he have brilliantly capture the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way the lighting be amazing pre dawn shoot schedule could have help great deal hervé de luze edit work have ensure that the narrative do not slip away from focus most notable be the scene where the human body be light on fire and the camera raise to show the smoke the darkness of the smoke be enhance and be use effectively to fade the scene out the scene where brody finger move as he rest his hand on the bar of the tram handle only go to show the brilliance of polanski as film maker great film that will be in the running for this year oscars will give it 9 out of 10
original and hand drawn head up this review be base on the first few episode of season 1 only be really look forward to rick and morty base on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this be hand drawn show like old more classic cartoon my concern be that it would end up with weak poorly write script that be not the case whatsoever this show be incredibly original with its write character style and imagination every episode and joke be completely different from the last which keep this show fresh and exciting to watch while think rick the grandpa be the funny no character be bad morty his dog snuffle and even morty 39 math teacher all pack in great joke the directing be great and the art style and the way it be draw be really really good the only problem have with the show be that don 39 really think they know how to end each episode so far at least but this be truly breath of fresh air when it come to comedy and think adultswim have really good show on their hand 9 10
excellent political social theme okay plot ott effect and great performance challa ascend to the throne of wakanda and take the mantle of black panther this be an entertaining and think provoke superhero origin story with number of solid performance the plot be reasonably strong with structure that resemble mashup of the lion king james bond and traditional marvel heroism for me the best aspect of it be the political and social theme that underpin the character and their motivation to have story so explicit about the historical treatment of african people and the plight of african community around the world as main stream cinematic event be breath of fresh air there be numerous strong positive non clichéd male and female african character in movie lead by an african marvel superhero the main protagonist journey through an arc that lead him to an important decision that impact the entire world the antagonist be complex and fight cause worth fight for but in the wrong way through this it deliver an important message that be very relevant in today divide world within the seriousness there be lot of humour through dialogue and performance shuri have some great moment of witty banter along with everett ross and baku the visuals be for me mixed bag love the cinematography colour lighting and edit in many scene whilst the effect be brilliant in some part find the cgi action spectacle at time to be cartoonish distracting and over the top this for me hurt film that carry such importance as the message get lose in mess of video game type spectacle on more positive note the performance from all cast be excellent chadwick boseman be every inch the title character whilst michael jordan be up there with the best of the marvel antagonists the support cast be superb with lupita nyong letitia wright danai gurira angela bassett andy serkis forest whitaker winston duke daniel kaluuya and martin freeman all perfect in their respective role

unbelievably irresponsible movie cartoon be typically targeted towards the young audience the impressionable mind the sponge so instead of make movie which teach that hard work sustain commitment discipline and patience ultimately pay off here we have the exact opposite the team who have spend lifetime prepare for task be push aside in favor of wholly unmotivated ill prepare unqualified on all account hero who be choose by destiny which fairy tale could do without it and convey through turtle who be about to kick the bucket himself in matter of two day panda who be so overweight that he literally can not get up and could or should keel over from massive stroke or heart attack any minute be sharpen into master kung fu fighter through program of consume chicken dumpling it a frightening message for the young generation that unqualified and unprepared triumph over the qualified and prepared by goof off panda have no inherent special power in him no gift be bestow upon him to make him special he just become special because he believe he special wow will say that there be nothing visually wrong in the way this movie be put together the animation direction and voice over be all first rate my beef be with the central premise of the movie which be why feel kid should not be expose to it
be it magical spoiler herein one hallmark of science fiction and fantasy be the creation of world that include to some extent the creator that way instead of inhabitant bump around in world we get complex set of interaction some as result of the world affect the player and some the other way around tolkien work fit well within this tradition in fact why it be so successful think be the thoroughness with which he develop the magical law the reader not only understand that the magic have power but have some notion of how it work that allow the reader to exist both at the level of frodo and the magical level of the wizard and demigod that the soul of the book not any episode not any theme about brotherhood or hope or any such sodapop the first film of this saga impress purely with the sheer ambition of the project and we now have the second one it be fun watch just like speed be in its day but m unhappy with some of the choice that be make with film there be specific way to span the two world way which few filmmaker have be exploit for long time long enough for some of them to appear in mainstream film almost none of those technique be use here nearly all the choice be one that plant us firmly in the world of the inhabitant who be buffet by the world force just like we as people be this literally boil all the magic out of the book and we be leave with braveheart meet the black cauldron except slightly more expensively do and with some monster the travesty be not that these choice be make to protect the investment in the film but that so many tolkien enthusiast miss the point and argue about whether elf appear in the wrong scene far to the philosophy of the film the manner in which the character deal with the camera be roughly equivalent to the relationship the reader imaginative eye have with the text in addition to be cast at the level of the adventure and not the magic there be other problem that stance be inconsistent the great offense come in the middle of the great battle until then the player have be dead serious they ve be in their life not character in movie that wink at us but all of sudden we have barrage of wink the surf move the dwarf toss joke the 007 like standoff on the bridge all of these depend on us know it be movie and the character leave their life and knowingly enter the movie other problem with that stance the various technology use each have their own way the camera must be use the two perspective that impress me be the handling of the fight between gandolf and the balrog and the relationship we have with gollum in the first our eye be magical as it swoop around sometimes watch the fight sometimes in the fight this use of the camera be new notice it also last week in treasure planet when encounter the black hole but it entirely different than the soliloquy gollum and several others have under the guise of talk to themselves they be really talk to us nearly look at the camera all of the camera engagement be from bergman and be his well study solution to the shakespearean stage technique like both of these but they be inconsistent with each other inconsistent with tolkien magic as noted and inconsistent with the movieland joke but there be even more diverse perspective we have the helicopter shot again from braveheart and few similar shot of virtual set we could have have some new movement like the balrog fight but we be suppose to recall similar shot and then there be the ents animation straight out of poltergeist it be another set of view determine by the technology rather the story shift among the bluescreen of hobbit in ents to the humanistic cgi gollum to the video game animation of the battle be jar we never be in tolkien world just browse through the aisle of your video store shift about lotr be write with specific notion of reading in mind and be bind to them but dune be not imagine film of dune with this budget and lynch originality instead of jackson me too isms now that would be cool ted evaluation 3 of 4 worth watch
deeply move film with message when go into this movie all know be that it have rachel mcadams brendan gleeson son who know from harry potter and six shooter and time travel as m usually not the great sci fi fan my expectation weren too high guess when leave the theater 120 minute later be wow by what just witness really like the way they split this film basically into two half the first be mostly romantic comedy the main premise be initially rather odd as the lead character find out from his dad that he have the ability to travel in time and so he do for while to correct certain mishap that happen to him mostly love related one and here and there also favor to friend won go into detail what he decide to relive particularly but it be all quite entertaining and never really drag how he need to run away to make it happen be always one of my favorite part mcadams be always nice to watch and she give solid performance here too read zooey deschanel be also an option for the part and don really like her so m actually glad they go with mcadams who have unusually dark hair here there be also one particularly sweet sequence when he finally have chance to get with the woman of his dream and realize she not the one he want but mcadams character be up to halfway into the film d maybe rate it 7 10 the second half however be where the film really deliver the two be an item at this point so there more dramatic focus now first on how their baby have change very move scene especially when he see the right one shortly afterward again through time travel and then for quite while on the relationship between the central character and his dad excellently portray by bill nighy also more scene on the main character sister crumble life get include and how time travel can solve these issue for her admittedly these come short quality wise compare to nighy but only because nighy nail his role so much the relationship between him and his son be just so wonderful to watch the table tennis with let the other win the walk at the beach and the final meeting which be inevitably the last as gleeson character be about to become dad once more eye wet stuff and cry quite bit for the last 45 minute as write early m really not that big on the sci fi genre in general but it always seem to deliver for me when it just sub plot genre to the exploration of interpersonal relationship just like here or in never let me go another film totally adore about time be feel good movie with serious undertone and some truly emotional high also it teach us to live every day in way we would not want to relive it even if we have the chance because it be just so wonderful the first time and we pay attention to all the beautiful detail and make the most of it and wouldn want to lose that day as we could hardly relive it in an equally great manner again because we make every minute count the director richard curtis be also responsible for the beloved mr bean and love actually and m okay with both but neither impressed me as much as this one here to me it his masterpiece and fine work to date it a perfect example of how smart story with lot of heart be more important than challenge character or super great performance who couldn even save the bad script it be my second favorite film of 2013 right now behind sein letztes rennen and very much recommend it and hope you ll have an equally great time watch this gem of movie thank you for read my review hope you enjoy it and don want to go into the near closet to go 10 minute back in time and unread it

best example of the power of cinema who could ve ever greenlit green book mostly true story of two men of completely different background overcome their own prejudice and the stifle racism of the deep south of the early 1960s we ll hire danish guy to play an italian guy and guy best know for play political fixer and dope dealer in house of card and moonlight respectively to play jamaican american musical genius and we ll have one of the farrelly brother direct it how could that possibly become great movie well it do primarily through the great performance of viggo jorgensen and mahershala ali and the nuanced directing of peter farrelly it confront the racism prevalent at the time without become preachy and show its main character grow through contact with each other without complete reversal of their character which would ve seem phony oh and the movie look great too the period car set and costume really take you back to that time period film festival favorite green book will hopefully be appreciate by oscar voter too

absolutely tedious seem be in the minority here but find this movie over calmingly tedious it start well the meeting on the train and the intriguing possibility of what may happen when two stranger meet by chance be allure but once they start wander around vienna it when it start to get bore the dialogue be just the kind of naive wistful cod philosophical nonsense that young couple on their first date come up with to impress the other partner fine if you be try to get lay but it make for rather irritate view after while be more interested in the scenery than what be go on with the main character by the end just wish they shut up and get on the damn train it not that don have romantic streak or appreciate dialogue base movie there be many good example of this type of film it just that expect not to almost fall asleep during it

funny character bad story it wasn a bad movie but come in with high expectation in the end the funny moment can not save movie without story if by throw in some punchlines and some cgis the studio can expect big pay day will be very disappointed of the audience preferences we should have good superhero movie in addition superhero movie be as good as the villain in the movie and will have to say this one be rather pedestrian normally bad people still have their reason to do the thing they do and it need to be sufficiently explain and exploit to tell good story be not sure about the bad guy in this movie there really isn an epic struggle to be remember no matter how much cgi be in the film

a terrific cast that deserve good script first thing first the devil all the time undoubtedly have the cast of the year tom holland prove himself as legitimate actor worthy of award recognition and robert pattison make the most of his limited screentime to create truly chilling antagonist the supporting player also shine with riley keough sebastian stan and eliza scanlen also deliver great performance however outside of the performance there be very little to say about devil all the time that be positive antonio campos script bite off more than it can chew with theme of religious fanaticism generational trauma and the nature of violence pop up on multiple occasion but the film have so many topic it want to explore that none of them end up be flesh out in any satisfying way leave the audience with bunch of half bake idea and sense of emptiness perhaps this would have work well as miniseries with slow burn or as short film with less character and subplots but in its final form the devil all the time be watchable but forgettable experience that win leave anyone hungry for more
well do but miss golden opportunity to really shine mostly spoiler note as former development exec within the movie machine of hollywood ve read hundred of script this one read about 10 year ago in some vastly different incarnation worthy of see for it vision of the city of new york largely reclaim by nature one hop that the upcoming remake of logan run will learn few key thing from be legend the following detail be my view of where this production lose it way this be only worth read if you ve already see the movie or have no interest in see it spoiler alert rest of this commentary how do the writer the producer the studio and the star all over look the prime opportunity to really make this movie movie to remember how do they miss the story that they almost write but then either decide to un write or ignore m write here about the importance of the leader of the infected population there a key scene in which one of the creature risk be burn by sunlight to see what have happen to one of the other creature that will smith character have capture for research purpose the movie leave this scene unexamined and throw away the huge potential for the story to have find far deep meaning that would have enhance the word of mouth factor even as be exit the theater heard viewer react negatively to the hokey and force end avoid this all the writer have to do be find in the zombie what neville character find in the woman and child that too conveniently arrive out of nowhere sense that future be possible the reason the leader of the infected people be willing to stick his head out into the sunlight be that the creature that will smith capture be his daughter ahhhh yes those of you who have see the movie suddenly get it this must have be an early draft of the project that someone unwisely decide to rewrite the reason he be so steadfast to capture neville character be not to kill him but to find out where be daughter be as evidence by the infected leader ability to plan and plot they be not brain dead creature they be simply infect with desire to kill that they can not overcome so what would the climactic scene have be about then that would have be about the leader of the infected see his daughter heal and project her and neville from the other infected creature to his demise as neville and the cured girl escape the city to restart the world and spread the cure obviously there lot more detail that could have be work into that but it amazing how everyone involve with this project opt for an end that in no small way be symbolic justification of suicide bomber that be just so silly it nearly undo all the good stuff that come before it overall the impact of miss these obvious story enhancement result in movie that loose the heft it could have have as it be be legend be only fair movie that could have be great fault entirely at the foot of the development exec and writer who think up the ham fisted finale without first seriously consider the clue within the story itself amaze that they miss it just amaze as movie lover and former development exec all ask be for little attention to detail within story apparently all involve be too busy to really read it carefully
over hype and tedious hat off to ryan gosling to learn to play the piano for this great achievement however in the end people can not suddenly become talented pianist singer and dancer just by practise for film part each of these skill be extraordinarily tough and unfortunately don think the lead character pull off either the singing or dance element very well the result be insipid and not very memorable within five minute of leave the cinema there be no tune or dance sequence that could recall and the plot itself be rather depress all in all not worth the money
have potential but miss the mark great potential good character and the stage be set for it to be home run however not everyone want heap side of virtue signal with their friday night entertainment this show definitely have all the ingredient to be good but fail miserably
brilliant no sadly hollywood this comment contain spoiler in that it direct you join me in see through the thin veil of hollywood and directs you inward to know what you really need and want instead of just explosion and effect seriously this could have be one of the best movie ever make that right m say it be not even the casual movie fan movie fan not one of the mindless herd have to admit that he she can sense the fear in the producer heart behind every scene in this movie they take great risk in make an expensive trilogy like this and they do not want to get the short end of the stick the result be compromise combination of good effect and good acting counterpoint with unnecessary cheeze ball action and well bad act the result be bizarre movie with brilliant scene follow by terrible scene everyone know the plot summary so will skip it every cool scene of dialogue every touch moment between old friend and every time we felt the pull of evil we be quickly before any of the sheep doze off bombard with scene of the gang struggle along on their trek fighting creature and get blow up apparently accord to my friend be the only person who notice the tragedy in the cave troll after slowly be disappoint for several hour be quite pleased to see the action take an interesting turn like this when the cave troll be lead into the room and have collar on with leash chain right away assume he be train beast make ferocious by be beat and torture over time by his master much like some people do with pit bull dog etc when the troll be fatally shoot through the mouth by the arrow he have on his face moment of unexpected for me realization of the wrongness of his action perhaps this be bring on by his own severe pain and sense that his life would be over in few moment when be ridicule for this by my friend say perhaps be just try to read something interest into this unnecessary action elijah wood have trouble at first put description to his particular form of bad act come up with the phrase blank act because he always have that one blank look on his face you know the one and the example that come to mind be the look on his face in the scene where the ring accidentally fall through the air and land directly over his finger friend of mine find review that have good description than mine what he do be not act it be face make and anyone can do it be this good movie as much as gladiator be good movie so be this one know the mass herd of movie go er return over and over again to see john woo and ridley scott and whoever else who claim to have new movie where they just blow stuff up in the same old predictable way and the people that make this movie know it too in order to preserve their bank account they put the explosion in for the sheep to wow over my plea for the future be this if you be go to take risk take it and don compromise make great film don let hollywood or anyone shape all of your craft into one boring blob if you can do that then you be not real movie maker

colin firth and geoffrey rush be pleasure to watch while the very idea of stammer king be inherently interesting as be the historical context of gather world war the real substance of this movie be the interplay between two fine actor colin firth and geoffrey rush firth give particularly rich performance bring his character to life with depth and subtlety as an american find the notion of monarchy in the twenty first century to be at best puzzle but the movie help us understand the importance of the king as unifying symbol of britain during time when the very existence of britain be under threat so even we yank can see how crucial it be that the king be able to address the people with reasonable fluency very enjoyable film

great idea for comedy but they forget the funny part in night at the museum ben stiller play his usual role as good hearted schlemiel thrust into humiliate situation that he ultimately emerge from with small measure of heroic dignity in this instance his character larry daley be an out of work weekend dad who be about to be evict from his apartment once again and thus lose the last shred of admiration his ten year old son have for him to keep both the apartment and the son affection he accept job as night watchman at new york city natural history museum where an egyptian tablet have for some decade administer powerful magic spell that cause history literally to come alive each even the museum wax and bone denizen human and animal alike become animate leave their various encasement and display wander the museum corridor and raise havoc with museum property each other and of course larry the human cast of character prominently include teddy roosevelt robin williams sacajawea mizuo peck attila the hun patrick gallagher miniature cowboy owen wilson and an equally diminutive octavius caesar steve coogan while the animal crew be head by capuchin monkey tyrannosaurus skeleton and pride of lion as we ultimately learn larry stiller have be select for the job because he seem like perfect stooge fall guy for the nefarious plan of three outgo night watchman dick van dyke mickey rooney bill cobbs he be ostensibly replace night at the museum be base on clever farcical concept that one might think would serve as perfect vehicle for stiller comic persona unfortunately something damage intervene in the concept translation to an actual film namely screenplay that be short on laugh and long on predictability and sap too many scene in night at the museum fall humorlessly flat for instance larry confrontation with the museum pompous but inarticulate curator others like the oprah style pop psychological healing of attila the hun inner child be almost embarrassingly bad the scene with diorama miniature cowboy head by owen wilson and miniature roman army lead by steve coogan octavius be mildly amuse thanks to the effort of the actor and neat special effect but again suffer from an underwritten and unimaginative script the scene involve sacajawea be completely pointless other than the riff on the pronunciation of the last syllable of her name waya or weeya by the third repetition of the joke it have be thoroughly empty of the scant humor it contain on the first go round and what can one say of robin williams turn as teddy roosevelt other than that it make one fondly recall the much funny teddy that stole scene in the classic arsenic and old lace except for one brief scene where williams be allow to release his inventive comic genius into parody of african click language he be keep completely in check and thus waste exhort the stiller character to rise to the heroic occasion repeat shakespearean chestnut about have greatness thrust upon one and moon after stalk sacajawea with unrequited love yes night at the museum do evoke few chuckle most example of which be include in the film ubiquitous trailer but it contain surprisingly little physical humor and utterly lack wit unless one find scene between stiller and the capuchin monkey concoct solely to justify the punch line stop slap the monkey the height of cleverness most member of the audience saw the film with didn think so or they be too young or too old to get the joke which raise another issue with the film what be the intended age group of its principal audience codger who might delight in the bit part of hollywood legend boppers who might identify with the museum docent who upon meet sacajawea supposedly the subject of her 900 page doctoral dissertation be reduce to pre verbal you rock groupie talk kid need history lesson or amuse by urine gag no doubt the intent be all of the above unfortunately that aim as with much of today hollywood fare end up reach none of the above very satisfyingly fall into the codger demographic myself the chief pleasure of night at the museum for me be the brief opening scene play between stiller and real life mother anne meara and the amazingly energetic performance of octogenarian dick van dyke and near nonagenarian mickey rooney look and act good than he have in what fifty year should also add some complimentary word for the film visual delight highlight by some stunning display of forced perspective as well as the imaginative animation of puppyish tyrannosaurus skeleton that enjoy play fetch with one of its own colossal bone all in all though night at the museum be major disappointment
they re still drag out this desperation wow could show possibly be on more borrowed time life support it funny that soooooo many people on here say that this film should have come out ten year ago when it actually would have matter and could have possibly be funny because be think the exact same thing what do that tell you people have too much emotional attachment to the show to admit that this film be awful they mindrape themselves into think anything and everything with the simpson face plaster on it be good much like female fan of johnny depp do if the film be 90 minute of the simpson sit on the couch and blink their eye they would say omg best movie ever how pathetic yes it be say already many time but m think it so m say it it be straight up 90 minute episode of the godawful past 11 season cheap and forced joke bowel movement reference lot of obnoxious loud noise and just plain lame unfunny nonsense topical humor that will be outdated in few short year pointless celebrity cameo and reference and anything else cater to the modern pulse too bad the generation after us win relate to any of the humor so that damn the film into not be timeless at all hmm how many borrow clichés from the show do we see marge threaten to leave homer springfield on the brink of disaster an angry mob the simpson on the run homer fall in love with something not human discord between bart and homer lisa fall for boy doubt that all desperation have replace dignity guy force yourself to like this all you want you re just embarrass yourselves another poster refer to the type of people who put everything else on hold like cut their plan short on sunday to watch the horrible new episode of the show as simpson zombie ll take it step far and say simpson martyrs as the word martyr be more jarring to western culture with this so called war on terror seriously why not martyr yourselves for cause more worthwhile like say stop the clubbing of baby seal or the shoddiness of jaguar since ford take over all you die hard fan who force yourselves to continue like this misery should go and form simpsonsbollah

some part be okay but lot be confuse and bore didn enjoy this movie that much even though be interested in the subject matter think it be just that how these people short the market isn that interest an aspect of the crisis it technical and bore there be some good point here and there the good point first the little explanation of the toxic product be illuminate the way the main protagonist find out about the depth of the crisis be also entertain there be some interesting moment like how p give out their aaa ranking the bad point the main character be just not very interesting to make movie about and you don feel for any of them or understand what they be talk about for lot of the movie christian bale character be kind of uninteresting the wake you up stripper and music be kind of daft and spoil the tone the conflict that steve carrell character or brad pitt character felt about make money from the crisis wasn very genuine there be 2 movie about the financial crisis that be much well about the crisis itself the hbo movie too big to fail and the excellent margin call understand that the big short wasn try to tell the same story and it be show thing from the pov of these people who short it may have the nomination and the list movie star but it rank below both of the above in term of clarity and entertainment value

the bad movie ve see in year after waste my time on this pathetic movie have make decision not to ever watch another movie with sara jessica parker she have continue the exact same one dimensional acting in every single part she have ever play this movie be no exception she can seem to get past playing carrie no matter what the subject matter one of the previous poster rightfully acknowledge sjp habit of clutch at her abdomen and chest for effect in every single role she play her high pitch screaming in every performance be the most irritating of all wonder how she continue to be cast in movie when she have no range as an actress while watch this movie have the feeling that they must have rush the production just to get it make there be ton of error and hardly single thought be complete all of the actor seem as though they would rather be somewhere else it be not funny clever or entertaining don be draw in by the trailer or any preview of this movie it be the bottom of the barrel
very poor and unnecessary sequel personally don understand how kung fu panda 3 have high imdb rating than the first or second film maybe as more people rate it that number will drop but don take it as represent the quality of the film could rant endlessly about what be wrong with this film but instead ll just say this if you ve see the first two film then just assume that you ve see this one as well apart from the addition of bryan cranston this film hasn change much even the humour in this one appear to be sadly lack in relation to the previous two this sequel make the same error that all sequel be make these day they follow formula to make this film exactly the same as the previous one just with slightly alter storyline g new villain who have never be mention previously
a fantastic piece of real sci fi think they didn make real sci fi in hollywood after see star war alien predator and later admageddon independence day etc etc ve get the impression that they only make these kind of sci fi film in hollywood the no brainers as like to call them they be really all about the fiction side of science fiction of course you can really blame the film maker since they make movie that the general public like and right now it seem to enjoy these no brainers don get me wrong m not say m great intellectual or anything just don share the opinion that good sci fi film need to have large explosion aggressive alien people get kill by colorful beam etc etc spoiler the contact be something completely different it belong to the the ever diminish group of sci fi with brain because of this it very understandable that it get negative feedback from the friend of no brainer sci fi actually find it quite funny how many people have criticize the end of contact say that they be disappoint when they didn see how the alien look like think that be one of the least important thing in this movie still would ve be disappointed if there have be some green alien with tentacle or one of those little grey roswell alien instead they make an excellent choice and didn show us the alien at all really good and brave decision in my opinion if you be disappoint when you didn see alien you didn really understand this movie the religion v science setting be really interesting and realistic it fit extremely well to modern day life and have never see it do well in any film the best thing about it be that the film doesn take side it just portray both of them and leave the decision to the viewer another important thing in the movie be realism one very impressive scene in particular come to mind ellie be in car go through the crowd after the signal have be receive and picture of hitler be discover in it the nazi be salute hitler new age fanatic be say that ufo be come some religious group think that jesus be return etc that scene really give me goosebumps that exactly how people would react if something like that happen in real life didn intend to write yet another review and win i ll just say that this movie be really really good they ve do great job at film carl sagan classic book if you want to see really think provoke well balance sci fi film not just another one where bruce willis save the planet at last moment watch the contact it be sci fi at its best
more down than up find the story have bit of weird twist like very much this animation from the very begin till the moment the guy take off in his house all that be very touching and so realistic and full of life but just as the guy take off everything from that moment completely lose the sense of reality turn into complete fairy tale without any foundation and to my experience just bananas spoil everything nice first felt about the story and the storyline never come back to earth from that moment it all cheap pixar bag of old trick nothing else no substance be so pi ed in the end that the hyped me up with the first 1 3 of the movie just to let me down with the rest in other word they make the first 1 3 of the story interest for any age and the rest be only for under 16 at best
gas pump girl be 14 and live down the street from where this be film use to walk by the filming everyday on my way home from school the actor yes kirsten be very cool and take the time to talk to the local kid in fact kirsten tell me that the name under consideration be super duper garage at the time the pyramid station across the street be actually build just for the film they build it and tear it down right after the film the city be actually not sacramento as be thank in the credit but del paso height the station be locate on the corner of arcade blvd and marysville blvd the scene where they ride the motorcycle down the street be film far down the same street the station be on near where it cross el camino blvd overall it be pretty crappy film 4 but for those that live by the shoot location it be now the only and probably will always be the only movie ever shoot in the city nostalgic to say the least 9 good time
good but not great the dark chapter form conjure universe but not the best and not even good than conjure the beginning of the film feel promise but the more behind the plot the more strange and there be some thing that seem force this film feel so dark and too many jump scare think the rating of this film be good than annabelle but no good than conjure
awful feel that this movie be just awful the acting be horrendous and the story be bland the action be minimal compare to the amount of stupid drama rorscach be the only bright spot in this film his character be the only one that keep me interested it just continually prove to me that marvel will always outfilm dc its fact the awkward sex scene be unnecessary and even the music in the film be corny would say that this movie lack something but that would be an understatement this movie lack mostly everything it be painful to watch and the fact that it be almost 3 hour movie mad it 10 time bad
get in line now screen frebruary 23 for australian medium there no reason for me to expect be go to like watchman know the cast be interest patrick wilson have make smart film choice that don rely on or intentionally subvert his good look hard candy little child jackie earle haley be icky in little child and m old enough to remember him from break away malin akerman be cute but 28 dress and the heartbreak kid do not superhero make jeffery dean morgan matthew goode and director zack snyder do cool thing with zombie in dawn of the dead and make wild and wacky movie in 300 which totally indicate his third film be probably go to be worth look but you know whatever so they all sign up for watchman base on comic bo sorry graphic novel that d never read and that be come to theatre less than year after ironman and the dark knight have redefine how good superhero movie could and should from here on in aspire to be that watchman have turn out to be the most complex exhilarating and deeply move fantasy film since terry gilliam brazil surprise nobody on earth more than me and man do it surprise in equal measure it be an inspired vision of an alternate world that echo but redefine our own existence a subversive yet bracingly humanistic exploration of the role of the superhero in modern literature a supremely adult take on the fetishistic pull of the heighten existence that life as saviour of society creates and a wildly exciting adventure story that turn normal people into exaggerated victim of their own creation and then back into mere human an exploration of the plot would reveal more vast theme but at this early stage of its release don want to risk lessen the experience for anyone can reveal this billy crudup as dr manhattan and jackie earle haley as rorschach create character every bit as captivating and deserving of oscar recognition as heath ledger joker malin akerman make an entrance to the world of superhero timelessness that will be the fantasy of every teenage boy age 15 to 50 and from the flawless art direction set design and special effect to mesmerise soundtrack watchman be film that revel in the perfection of minor detail be warn those expect spiderman like teen angst or fantastic four like silliness will be stun perhaps not quite sure of what they have find watchman be an extraordinarily mature risky project for hollywood to role the dice on especially give similarly complex exploration of social collapse and vigilantism for vendetta most specifically have fail to do blockbuster number but watchman be something special and deserving of analysis and discussion as bold an attempt at commercial film make as can remember watchman be an undeniably unique movie experience rich perverse violent and resonant
never though it could be bad than oblivion not sure what be the problem with science fiction these day but truly most fail that be not right matt damon one be pretty strong and decent but the rest on par with oblivion edge of tomorrow be bite about clone the only different be that it be not human that be clone but time this repeating time thing certainly doesn appeal to me the same scene be project multiple time be truly bore but there be worst the plot of this movie be non existent the first thing we know be that man not fit for combat be send to the frontline for an obscure reason since it be in the future fighter be wear can of robotic skeleton the robotic thing look very stupid by the way it felt like more of weight burden than an advantage which be lame tom cruise try to look like virgin gun welder be not bad but it be bit guffaw oh didn watch all the movie but guess 20 minute give me good idea of what will be the rest since everything repeat almost identically for the reminder of the movie almost forget we have no idea what be the foe do or purpose
maybe expect too much since love metropolis and be mesmerize by the great storyline of i happily shell out 25 euro to get the deluxe dvd set of fritz lang first talkie fully expect be go to view it over and over again well that be 25 euro i should have spend on new haircut or something this be very boring film one that be only somewhat redeem by great peter lorre and an interesting final scene but the first hour be sooo slooow low point be ten minute scene in which four bore men be have round table about decide what to do about the child killer no camera movement whatsoever just blabber and no oneliners either he a killer for heaven sake action do something stop him look back maybe be even more mesmerize by the brand the film poster be great and that single just make for classic even harrow logo still honestly can believe that modern viewer would actually enjoy this
very high influx of the african in france will not share enthusiasm for this film saw other review know it be politically correct to help people and do not think of the disabled people be think about million of african and other immigrant try to come into france specially paris and try to find job how many will succeed one per cent this film focus on aristocrat who hire poor african from the suburb of paris how often that happen in the real life not that often plot be well ok but not that realistic and that be what hate like realistic plot not improbable one like this one acting be excellent actor be really try to make something out of this film many people like it do not that much
i be another cliché this be not bad film it just not that great the story feel bite weak and there be so many plot hole it take away part of the enjoyment also find myself un interested in the character apart from the dog but who doesn love cute dog it just seem to be cliché after cliché after cliché have to remind myself didn go to watch shawshank redemption 2 or william shakespeare film adaptation instead watch 90 odd minute of blah good special effect and action sequence plus the added bonus of eye candy be just enough to save it just if you go to see be number four suggest you leave your brain at home then sit back and enjoy the pretty light and move picture don expect much and you might actually enjoy it
this be the bad movie ve see in 10 year not really even sure where to start we ll go through the low point blow by blow storyline there isn one the entire plot make no sense and be so ridiculous as to have you laugh out loud for most of the movie yeah kid get kidnap and mother will stop at nothing to get him back see that before but what you ve not see be the utter drivel they come up with in this movie utter garbage dress up as some kind of action it the bad story ve see in as long as can remember haven even get to the end yet and m write this act woeful beyond belief halle berry would have to have be utterly desperate to get involve with this garbage minute of talk to herself about how she win let her kid go all while in the middle of car chase obviously the part be write and there not much she can do about the story line but unless she need the money she just walk away no idea why she even involve action appal high speed stunt film at about 5km then speed up to seem fast non sensical action scene that add nothing other than further ridicule to this movie cinematography can say ve ever see anything as laughably appal as this during the high speed chase we get minute worth of tyre go around footage intersperse with minute of yellow line on the road we get it they re drive overall this movie be atrocious and simply not worth your time unless you want to spend couple hour yell at the tv to get her to actually do something towards get her son back abysmal appal ghastly garbage
they lose the substance in all the cgi effect when you read this review keep in mind that have expect ghost in the shell to be solid 10 10 and that it could quite possibly be one of the best movie of this decade instead it tepid didn hate it but it be bite like nice but not great roller coaster nice entertainment for the moment but nothing you write home about it have lot of great cgi effect but the character be seriously lack it like they didn want to give the character any texture or depth because that could detract the viewer from the special effect think this be more question of direction and edit rather than act typically feel can re watch good sci fi movie couple time whether it more action like minority report or more drama like interstellar the rewatchability factor to me be more question about the feeling get from watch the movie sadly the rewatchability factor for this movie be basically 0 on my part in the end it like watch very long movie sequence in video game but in video game the film sequence be just small part of the whole experience and that how this movie feel in the end like it be lack big part of the experience
truly appal while peruse the other entry for this film the preponderance of review give it mildly enthusiastic or at least average rating astound me find it inconceivable how someone could appreciate this movie on any level while it feature decent act it contain plot so awful that it make it impossible to respond with even the most minute degree of enthusiasm the plot center around sin eater an individual who by perform an arcane ritual be able to secure salvation for those outside the church who would otherwise go to hell while operating in this capacity he be immortal but he have grow weary of bear the sin of others and desire to find replacement so that he may die in peace he attempt to cultivate young priest for this role and the film deal with the ensue event while have no desire to express an opinion here on theological issue in real life find it preposterous that within the world of this film salvation really do come only through the teaching of the roman catholic church though the movie depict the church in the most unfavorable way possible within its frame the church alone apparently truly do hold the key to salvation this fact necessitate the burdensome task of the sin eater and thereby establish the premise of the film but it also raise question about how anyone in the film expose to such wicked church or god could accept the doctrine that salvation come no other way person who believe that salvation come through the church alone would likely be member of the church and adhere to its teaching someone outside the church would not likely believe that the church alone provide salvation yet for the sin eater to function the order cinematic world must be populate by many people who both believe that the teaching of the church be entirely correct and reject those teaching nonetheless ultimately the order depict hapless clergy and laity alike viciously exclude from salvation by tyrannical church which regard not even god power as sufficient to overcome their deed if anything this movie offer an unintentional apologetic for the protestant doctrine of salvation by faith alone watch this movie with friend and laugh or don watch it at all
who pull your string faith healer who appear from nowhere suddenly cure the sick son of profound government senator whom the politician wife fall under the mysterious healer charm and the young boy grows attach to his company the senator can shake the idea that there something strange about all of this could it all be hypnotic trick or be there something really supernatural go on here then you get the chief political adviser who try to rid the healer of power he hold over the senator and his family because he want to be the one who in control of the senator be it all an illusion who be play whom do this go beyond reality by make way for supernatural influence like you see there be so many question bring up here that be totally left unexplained but this enigmatic factor of who what and why make for one curious but oddly enchanting spectacle the multi layer story play out like political fantasy where it throw around many different idea and allegory into the blend where nothing seem quite like what it be because of real mystical edge that give out by powell charismatic character wolfe as an exhilarate tale it fail for me but for curiosity piece it really do work the plot outline share its similarity with the rasputin account but this film have go with contemporary take on the story the story do become incredibly strange with certain circumstance and situation in which you have to suspend your disbelief and play around with psychological tension the thick air of mystery that plant in the film you could say be like that of jigsaw puzzle that miss some important piece to give it that truly satisfy feel the complex script be heavy on its parallel theory and it very much come across like poetic riddle that most of powell line anyway with it parables and psychic jargon it a very talkative piece with little significant detail and hint run throughout it very mischievous layout on who really the manipulator and just what be everyone true intention the film which be make in australia look reasonably good even though it have modest budget to work with by today standard the appearance and even the context be somewhat dated the special effect be reasonably modest with the odd hokey effect but guess you just get to take it with grain of salt the mostly well devise fxs be well orchestrate in to the story but it do go over the top in the third act be the uneven pacing make way for some flamboyant magic trick for the fight of control over the senator at least they be spot on with it but they do and as well as the costume give it an underlining campy grade charm the location setting be simply ravish and the exterior of the senator house be it all mostly play out be give grand feel the glitzy cinematography be remarkably well handle with some showy moment and brian may tenderly spooky score have sting but emotional rush too it director simon wincer manages to come up with some inspired solid visuals and tiny pocket of heighten and exciting suspense but some moment be half baked and it have an climax that doesn feel like it have pay off you just feel like it work up for something big however it do fit in with its subtle moodiness the performance be very first rate with an international cast on show robert powell play the healer wolfe and his pierce capability create such subtly mysterious imprint good or evil that you can help but be intrigue by david hemmings underplayed performance as senator nick rast show real solidarity broderick crawford superbly play doc wheelan greedy political leader who overlook senator rast and when he on screen his presence truly govern the film carmen duncan as sandra rast simply shin in her feisty role and mark spain utterly fit the role of eerie young lad alex rast think the chemistry of the relationship be well think up and naturally suitable what be serve up here be exceedingly ambiguous and different but this creative project have more go for it then what actually meet the eye it far from flawless and it wasn what expect that for sure but it do make for an interesting viewing
endless contemplation the story be set at an expensive swiss health resort and it focus in particular on an age director mick harvey keitel and an even old ex composer fred michael caine fred seem like man wait to die and even though the queen of the united kingdom want him to perform for her he make lot of excuse his friend mick however seem very active try to make that one great film which will be his finale the film have hardly any plot apart from two old men contemplate life and their existence in many way if you like one of ingmar bergman more depressing film you essentially know what youth be go to be like somber depress supposedly insightful and as much fun to watch as your grandmother take bath overall hard film to watch let alone enjoy some obviously like it base on the other review but find that even though the film be make well and well act it be tedious and depress even an incredibly beautiful and sensual nude scene wasn enough to spark my interest in this story

nothing happen here elektra or as know her that chick from daredevil who turn up in wolverine solo book once or twice so daredevil wasn that bad it serve me well as mild entertainment once or twice figure that elektra might also pass as amusing after all it promise to be about ninjas and do love good ninja movie after cark it in daredevil elektra jennifer garner be bring back by her master stick terence stamp she become an assassin for hire but while on an assignment she become fond of her supposed target mark miller goran visnjic and his thirteen year old daughter abby kirsten prout and decides to protect from the hand shadowy underworld organization of ninja with freaky power lead by kirigi will yun lee small group of the hand elite set out to finish elektra job and elektra too woah so never think movie all about good ninja and bad ninja involve in some sort of ninja war could be so boring elektra turn out to be character drive ninja movie instead of ninja driven ninja movie don mind non action movie every so often but elektra be present full on action movie and that be all want in the middle of do university assignment and study for test basically it follow the same style as hulk but be less exciting jennifer garner spend long period of the film stand around look bore and generally give out performance one might usually expect from someone like steven seagal her elektra be much more interesting in daredevil than in elektra despite an entire film about her you really don learn anything about the character at one point abby mention that elektra have ocd but it just seem pointless and be never refer to again the other character get shaft too elektra apparent love interest make very little impact on the movie and all we know about the villain be that they be ninjas with freaky power no explanation no origin nothing there be barely enough action in elektra to even qualify as an action much of the time waste on follow the character around as they do nothing could have be use to beef up elektra as an action film as it stand they be pretty ordinary and almost nowhere to be see mean few more extended fight scene could have make elektra amuse at least elektra isn as terrible as marvel nick fury movie but it doesn come close to some of marvel more awesome movie like the punisher at best elektra be barely average very little happens
i think its only good to fan so got drag along to see this with my friend at the midnight session view expect an ordinary super hero movie which it turn out to be nothing much m not fan of the novel nor do even know what it be about till get there the movie seem over stretch have no real plot understand till the last 30mins jump around from scene to scene too much fight scene be sub par and so many useless scene they could have cut some pretty bad act from malin akerman for movie like this think the music that go with the movie be also pretty awful and could have have well music selection the movie seem to be over explained and leave nothing the you imagination it seem like there be constant narrating through out the whole movie overall not movie for the ordinary person if your not fan of the novel then you probably win like the movie from my understand they try to stay true to the novel for me it be just overdone
this have to be the most overrated movie of the 90 there be mystery in the world which be completely unfathomable to me and one of them be why anyone can consider this film to be any good at all have never walk out of movie theatre but when go to see this be more tempted than ever it be true that it have promising start with the first alien signal be detect by scientist but from that point on it go downhill at the speed of light apparently it be suppose to be realistic hypothesis on how contact with an alien civilization could take place but for me the story be completely unbelievable and so full of hole that they be too many to list them all don believe nasa would ever handle thing the way they do in the film don believe the church let alone some neo hippy preacher would have squat to say in how thing be handle don believe terrorist could ever get that easily to the very centre of the most expensive and important structure ever build by mankind don believe some rich guy could set up secret spaceship orbit the earth aside from the power that be just like that don believe nasa would be so keen to discredit the tale of their choose ambassador especially have proof the hour of blank tape that there be some truth in it and absolutely do not believe alien would show up in virtual beach with the face and voice of some poor girl dead daddy it be all so ridiculously contrive and movie like that simply can not understand the general public perception that all of this be realistic profound or brainy for me it right down there with independence day in those department and on top of that it as boring as watch paint dry at least independence day be fun what the heck
this film define the term dog breakfast as we all know hollywood have produce some extremely expensive bomb but in my humble opinion this one remain in class all its own while it be certainly possible to spend million of dollar create humongous ornate set and fill those set with thousand of extra the sheer immensity and complexity of the result do not automatically equal great art big be not always well in fact as in the case of this movie it make for more spectacular failure perhaps the best way to explain the failure of cleopatra be to contrast it with another hollywood epic ben hur in the latter film there be sublime scene where ben hur be be whip by roman guard on force slave march ben hur fall and we see christ whose face be never show help ben hur with drink of water the expression on the face of ben hur and the guard as they react to christ kindness be one of the most moving scene in film history only two actor be involve and the back of third but the result be light year beyond anything cleopatra achieve the acting in cleopatra strike me as wooden and passionless which be fatal defect in movie about woman who be suppose to set men aflame with desire elizabeth taylor do not impress me as great beauty in this film in fact she look kind of short frumpy and chunky though it possible that beauty standard have change somewhat since 1963 one of the few good point about the film be that it fill in some glaring gap in my knowledge of roman history all in all would say the movie have unique grandiose and epic kind of badness you need to slow down and gawk at it as you would gruesome pile up on the highway you should see it just so you know how bad hollywood dog breakfast can be
old equal good one of the big il movie hitchcock cary grant 8 6 here at imdb this move along with lot of other golden oldie be give much too high rating at imdb argue that the reason for this over rating be that people review movie as if it be sport and not art let me explain when you review world cup soccer match from the 50 you must take into consideration that the game be much slow the tactic simple and that the player be not very well train compare to today that be the world cup final between west germany and hungary in 1954 be top quality entertainment perform by world class artists if you look at it 1954 if you look at it today the first thing that strike you be how much everything have improve put simply the world cup winner of 1954 would not win one match in any division two series in europe today but still we can look at the cup final from 54 and say yeah that be great game consider it be play 50 year ago with art it another story you don consider or rather shouldn consider age as factor you win hear anyone say yeah picasso paint some good shiit back in his day but he could never compete with today artists the same go for mozart beethoven leonardo michelangelo etc etc my argument be that the movie art should be treat as any other art form let apply this to the movie in question act would like anyone that give this movie rating over 6 7 to look at the car chase scene one more time and tell me what they think of cary grant act in that scene can tell you all that one of my friend at age 15 act drunk well than old cary do here and nobody even believe that my friend be drunk it piss me off when someone say that the acting be superb in this movie it be an insult to all actor of today plot win bore you with an analysis let just state that the plot be unbelievable and some scene ridiculous script hitchcock be say to be the master of suspense in north by northwest the suspense level be so low that not even ten year old would get pulse from watch it the dialogue be however smart and funny conclusion bad act unbelievable plot pretty funny extremely overrate 4 10 if you be hungry for hitchcock flick watch rear window instead
maybe my least favorite godard after check out couple of godard eighty work first name carmen which be very good movie and king lear which be one of the most fascinating car wreck adaptation of shakespeare to come out of european cinema know have to check out hail mary as by historical account get the kind of treatment that be almost bestow on last temptation of christ and dogma the religious right in america and abroad thought of the film as blasphemous many say this before see this and crude wouldn compare hail mary to last temptation in controversy since neither one really have anything to be controversial about whatever viewer might take the film as good or bad it doesn degrade or spit on the christian religion and its eternally sacred story of the virgin mary joseph and the baby jesus it be godard after all and outside of weekend straight up satire of the 60 radicalism and revolutionary air in france at the time he hasn try to deliberately get people tick off by his work by my account though hail mary isn a great movie good movie or particularly engrossing account of the tale despite the hype the story be fiddle through the godardian consciousness as such teenage basketball player name mary myriem roussel with boyfriend who drive taxi name joseph thierry rode be visit by foul and entirely no non sense uncle gabriel philippe lacoste one of only two act appearance ever and tell she will conceive god child despite never have have sex with no one include joseph this spark rage in joseph and disillusionment in mary who can figure out what to do with the situation the rest of the film unfolds in style that remind me of what godard do later on with nouvelle vague where in whenever image be present that suggest that godard in another life outside of be new wave pioneer be more fit in his late day to be directing nature documentary as oppose to feature length film there aren many emotion outside of coldness between the suppose lover mary and joseph and scene of compulsively naked roussel that inspire only one really memorable shot win reveal it but find it freaky in how real it might have or might have not be there be problem have with hail mary as have state and when the film be over the recent religious film gain hoopla come to mind gibson passion of the jesus the two problem have with both film be these the first for non christian or non believer in him there be not real entry portal to really get into the sympathy of the character of mary she feel pain resentment love all of these thing for god and the way the film present it if you don have or have not have before kind of feeling or attitude towards god and christianity the entail symbolism godard use include the dramatizes of it all win fit the second for film even what be supposedly film in high regard to the great artist of the celluloid deal with as strong subject as immaculate conception with potc it be the gradual torture and death of jesus besides the point this be highly boring and dis joint result for all the image of nudity and sky and ocean and road there isn really much that it amount to this isn help by the performance either roussel rode lacoste and even young juliette binoche either didn get the right direction or the on the fly style of godard didn work with them or they just push the realism envelope to its limit and too beyond roussel a lovely young girl and fair actress but when the audience get to see support character anderson character show more emotion in her face her eye there trouble rode also create little by over act or not be there at all emotionally perhaps another minor beef have with godard treatment of the subject matter be this by take the his creation story which it be at base level believe in it or not really as much of leap of faith as be the detail of jesus crucifixion in such dead pan no humor morose attitude godard try for kind of neo realism that backfire why not make the film straight out satire or have fun with the story element like with gabriel character be hop his would be the one cool element of the film but it hard to keep of track of him the short film that precede the film by occasional collaborator anne marie mieville at least have light hearted feeling to it and let art combine well with empathetic character smith dogma serf as another example however more in the mainstream than here by the time godard rumble and plod through his image and music soundtrack that manage some of the few interesting part of the film bach dvorak and coltrane be some artist among others that sometimes get annoyingly sample over and over to no effect and get to mary end moment the catharsis be empty and frustrate here his logic be generally if not altogether one note concept stretch out with practically one note emotion string out from the watchable yet poor actor and there one or two sub plot in the film that boggle the mind maybe if watch the film without sound it be of some interest on mi en scene level though even that wear thin it surely my least favorite film of the director so far and at best can say that like the passion you win get it or roussel private part if you re that type of person out of your head
film should have maximum age limit of 10 the film be make out of ryan reynolds throw lame joke to the camera in between there be bullet and knife no surprise no idea the story be simple and silly and boring man sleep with woman long in different scene teen hello good watch porn there be more detail man go to basement to become special teen like to be special man become special and kill all bad guy around him the end the joke be not only lame they be old for example the joke with the red shirt and brown trouser hear from my grandpa don waste your time with this film marvell try to squeeze out last cent out of the theme bad film will follow

great fun disappoint stake not masterpiece comparable with the recent disney and pixar animation but still worthy animate show skillfully direct and full of good taste humor it very interest to notice the script way of mix together quality and flaw yeatman original story be pretty cheap naive and unconvincing mainly in the final part that win spoil for you still one should say that the conclusion be bad than disappointing but fortunately the wibberleys be able to recuperate it in great proportion by articulate the plot into solid and well built script as such yeatman main contribution remain the direct efficient precise professional of course the great fun be the character but attention not the human one which remain simplistic and full of cliche in deliberate but sparkless way attempt to keep the movie at the facile level one suppose it appropriate for child but the rodent credible amusing and endear portrait responsible for the permanent joyous smile also mark by few laugh that follow from start to end this enjoyable new 3d experience

noah review we all know the tale it be tell parody and stereotype to the point where the original context can get lose in the flood of pop culture in this modern telling of the story of noah ark the film definitely emphasize the mythic aspect to deliver large than life spectacle as expect you will see fantastic vision of creation and death hoard of animal enter the ark the the deluge sweeping over the earth what you may not expect be that the film also include massive army of barbaric hoard clash with fall angel flash of magic and mysticism twist in morality that challenge noah heroic and an overall tone that grim brutal and somber and yet despite so many liberty it still capture the essence of the story in its own unique way the film be somewhat split in half the first half contain all the big scale setpieces contain plenty of special effect and scene of war once the flood commences and the big battle end the film settle down and become brood drama pace becomes herky jerky because of this audience want action might enjoy the first half and get bore by the end while others may feel the opposite the overall tone be very grim and the film doesn shy away from show the raw brutality of the world of sinner and the struggle for survival part of it will work part of it might not ultimately this movie will be different from person to person and it will likely be one of the big love it or hate it film of 2014 it will depend on your disposition on the storytelling this story take lot of liberty from the bible if it a word for word accurate account you want the film will disappoint some of the change be purely cosmetic to give the film kind of high fantasy aesthetic such as the inclusion of the watcher some change be make to make the plot more convenient the big alteration involve the addition of the descendant of cain provide human antagonist for noah to fight in big battle and one central villain to draw out even more drama one other big change that might upset purist be what do to noah and his family the film contrive huge drama out of their legacy go so far as push them to odd and amoral direction that truly challenge our notion of what could have happen in this ancient story all that be say felt the liberty with the story be warrant because the film methodically create many long thread of conflict and entwine them into one big braid of plot that give it momentum and drive the character to their most logical direction without all this drama the character really wouldn have much to do before or after the big flood as it be the film fill itself up with so much conflict that it give the character life and mind of their own and their action generate some very complex dynamic that ultimately contribute to deeper thematic depth think the film great strength be the subtext the film be load with idea and theme concern creation mankind sin judgment mercy and morality most of these idea be convey sublimely through the use of powerful image and punctual dialogue in the end we re make to understand on deep level exactly why the flood happen why noah act the way he do why thing play out the way they do and what the implication be most of the film conflict revolve around the sanctity of creation the film show lot of brutality as the descendant of cain defile creation in contrast to noah who try his best to preserve it as the film go on theme of environmentalism industrialization and resource depletion become very blatant offering frighten reflection not only of the past but also of what could come in the future the final message however be an uplift one that always find most elegant the idea that the end be also the beginning this be rather bleak apocalyptic tale but the film radiates hope by its end the film be well craft with some very incredible photography and editing there be number of scene in the film that be appropriately powerful and move thanks to the way it unite key imagery and symbolism with the narrative russell crowe be as good as usual and do have some great standout scene jennifer connelly be perfectly compel in her role and be surprise that emma watson put on great performance as well everybody else do alright write get the job do well but most of the dialogue seem pretty blunt this production spar no expense on the real look set prop and costume some special effect be okay some be make to look bit archaic on purpose namely the watcher who be animate in some kind of stop motion style and some effect be incredibly brilliant clint mansell music score be as elegant as ever the film will not sit well with everybody some folk will be bore others might be upset that it not 100 true to the bible however noah be film experience personally value lot its issue didn really affect me that much and grow to admire the story and all it mean on deep level with its blend of action visual splendor and compel storytelling felt it be fairly moving picture however this be not an easy movie to casually recommend you might love it you might hate it it ll all depend on your view of the bible of director darren aronofsky and of hollywood and its embellishment the best can say be give the movie try because this really be one of kind epic
initially an entertaining movie turn to waste of time tom cruise and cameron diaz appear in this action comedy movie which fail in both the action and comedy venture tom cruise as roy miller in this movie have no problem work as the role of secret agent whilst cameron diaz be the conventional blonde who become reluctant colleague in his daring scene when first saw the trailer of knight and day predict it fairly mainstream summer flick think that have tom cruise back for do his best in this action hero character would guarantee his view when finish see it felt about as though should be review on two separate film haul bagful of metal scrap to repair her father old car cameron diaz as june haven be on her way to her sister wedding when she accidentally meet handsome and charm roy miller tom cruise after continually meet each other at the airport and finally on the same flight they begin to flirt with each other the first half part of this movie assure firm fun experience due mainly to the joke between tom cruise and cameron diaz these two have great movie chemistry and some scene between them be extremely hilarious it the perfect combination of comedy and action and everything seem to be go efficiently it seem like whenever the action scene be to get good they have to remind you how childish and silly this movie be to be the amazing use of leather jacket by tom cruise in this movie make the jacket lover attract to him the exact replica of his leather jacket be available at one of the lead website know as desert leather they manufacture the same leather jacket as wear by the hollywood celebrity overall knight and day be an ok movie due to its brand new script great presentation magnificent shoot incredible action good comic timing and an enthralling direction and for the first time it actually not gratuitous

john wick meet good will hunt it as if john wick be the savant janitor from good will hunt and surprisingly it work what should you expect it have flash of john wick action but it most certainly isn an all out action movie however it also isn primarily drama focus on his autistic accounting side of thing felt they do really good job of combine both element into movie that swing back and forth between the two think the acting be great all around find the plot solid and enjoyable here be the bottom line yes this movie be worth your money to see in the theater s ll be the first to admit have no idea how autism really affect people and how accurate it be or be not portray in this movie saw this movie as nothing more than what it be fictional story to entertain
underwhelmed why didn they just call it the nikki sixx story hardly any of mick back story be include the actor portray vince be phenomenally atrocious the only part worth mention be the closing credit
perfect graphic basically no story the movie do an amazing work on the graphic texture light everything look very real since many war scene be involve there re plenty explosion to demonstrate the cutting edge cgi work however if you didn read anything about the story in advance the movie will make no sense to you you can feel it when an important character show up yet since there no introduction on the back ground story the thing character do make no sense to you if you play any ff game in the past some of the thing be very obvious like the ring but the overall story telling be very poor huge monster show up with no explain huge statue come alive and no one in the movie surprise guess wasn the only ask myself what go on again and again hope the story complete itself in the game
the skeleton key do it first and do it well the 2005 horror thriller star kate hudson gena rowlands john hurt and peter sarsgaard bring atmospheric dread to the body switch genre complete with voodoo an antebellum mansion and the swamp of louisiana yes there be black character and white character and element of racism in the old south black servant be hang and burn in front of rowdy 1920s party guest in one scene but unlike get out the skeleton key doesn overthink it or try to be socially or politically provocative here the black white role be reverse but not in the way you might think it tell story downright scary one the character bring on the chill with aplomb and the end be stunner
weak so another superhero movie be hop it might be at least as good as the first if not well but alas this be really weak just like thor ii some one need to let movie director know that action sequence lot of sequence do not make up for really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog agree with lot of others that they should have develop cap story more his time with his old girl be short and amount to nothing but guess they didn know how not to make it too sad you know that you re in trouble when the supporting character be more interesting than your hero and all of your villain samuel again rock nick fury and we all know that black widow desire movie of her own could have care less about the winter soldier and poor robert redford be really out of place everyone should be glad that shield fold because they really need to start over with some good guy hope the next one be while cause m not look forward to anymore action sequence
american propaganda movie if this movie be about germany in the 1930s 1940s adolf would have be proud it tell about the greatness of country the home of the good and the brave in these time this movie be like it want to tell us all hey we re spy on all of you but we re do it for the good of everyone the most epic scene be when the american flag be fall from the white house and at the end when it fly again you can learn lot about the usa in these kind of movie what good person the president be how cool the american force be and how immense the american will be to protect everyone freedom in the whole world seriously this be propaganda at it best it a shame that actor like morgan freeman an gerad butler part of such movie
an ambitious project with sad result in jackson defense the project be ambitious to begin with turn 310 page of child literature into an epic hollywood trilogy many debate go on about which movie be the best the fairy tale the one in between or the die hard alike final the sad truth be that to pure fan they be one by one in their own unique way an abomination what can one expect from battle that start in the third to last chapter in the book but that go on for 144 minute in the film adaption grant some of the battle scene be innovative in fact the begin the cooperation between the elf and dwarf who have be ridicule each other like tom and jerry at first be most entertaining for few minute at most but not for two hour of course the writer realize this therefore these bombastic large scale battle be alter with individual scene and this be where all touch with tolkien fade not only be the action scenes needlessly absurd think of legolas jump from one fall stone to another of azog open his eye in an so melodramatic fashion we ve see way too many time and of brad ridiculous carriage scene but the individual story weren nearly as grasp as they should have be and this can be forgive for thranduil and his son in an unsuccessful end scene that be empty of any convincing emotion in an attempt to make bridge to the lord of the ring series this can even be forgive for thorin the classic anti hero who go mad after barely few day of be around his treasure but realize his true destiny just in time only to die an honorable death in order to obtain forgiveness for his 20 minute earlier sin but this can be forgive for the hobbit bilbo baggins be supernumerary in his own movie and that be inexcusable all fan of tolkien will probably watch this the feeling m leave with be gratefulness for the untouchable lord of the ring series they can never be take away the hobbit fall short right there where the lord of the ring be most powerful loyalty to tolkien the trilogy do not fail because it grasp for hollywood greatness it fail because tolkien would watch it and say what fine movie where you get the idea

sci fi twist by religion have chance to re watch contact today saw it originally when it be in the theater and must say have very bad memory of the movie which be strange because if you know me you know that just love science fiction have weak spot mile wide can ignore massive plot flaw and bad act for just taste of what mankind might become in the future or what he might see in the future and admit when start watching be again captivated movie about first contact and about human travel among the galaxy and the massive complex machine that would take them there will tell you the machine itself be marvel it be an amazing effect the science at least early on in this movie be fine not amaze but good than hollywood average but throughout the whole movie the intertwining of religion and science be clumsily handle ridiculous soliloquy be give by the religious right and equally clumsy rebuttal by the scientist which all lead in the end to science be force to admit to faith in front of the us congress no less it be shameful end movie could well have rat as 7 entirely demolish in the last 5 minute of the movie what waste
overall an interesting watch but horrendous end make it fall flat okay so m sure you ve by now hear that the end be horrible and that the film itself be testament to the rich above the poor and the need of many be always want but let talk more about the end up until there be around fifteen minute in the movie would ve give it 7 8 star but this end oh god this horrendous crap on your time end so they make it to the bottom floor and the table stop okay fine sure but apparently somehow little girl be the only person there not another person and nor body nor blood mark weird since ever floor since have be two people to floor then we look at the little girl they find completely clean mean pretty much spotless like she be just put there today she doesn talk and she doesn comprehend the give and take of the floor she be at which just leave more question like why didn miharu ever find her since she go down the floor many time do she just give up around floor 200 because even more reason we ll never know now they stay and the food be give to the girl which until that point would cause the room to kill it inhabitant but somehow doesn now ofc baharat randomly dy off camera in such lackluster way that it make you want to forget the fact that he give up his floor 6 privilege to follow some random white dude down 200 floor to ration out food because reason guess now to add further annoyance to the end you sit there and watch this huge build up of the final half hour of the movie expect some big revelation or change to be have only to be give the mother of all middle finger in the form of self sacrifice of the mc because once more reason now to point out something small that just mind bender that table be fly upwards at super high speed how do they know it wouldn just come to complete stop at the end and send the content slam into the ceiling there literally no knowledge here they could ve just kill that little girl for message in the end the end itself just make you draw your own conclusion and cop out it end it could ve be great movie if not for this
have so much potential then flop agree with another reviewer rczmiller m not prude person but this movie make me uncomfortable completely get it wrong think this would be like the scary movie hit the story line be good stayed true to the horror film but ruin it by turn it into one long drag out sex reference with annoy character cedric and usually like him be all the graphically play out sex with stuff animal be rap by ghost and the overdone swinger and gay reference really need we didn think so would be laugh one minute just to get disgust by the next ten can believe we waste our money on see this in the theater complete let down

bore this film remind me of the henry kissinger line where he say when people meet me and they be bore they think it their fault people who watch this movie and don get it or be bore with it be too embarrassed to say it they don want to come across as unsophisticated so they all pretend this be some cinematic masterpiece oh please for some reason when it a british film this kind of dreary boring movie be say to be genius if this be make in america with american actor people will be say this movie suck
good but not what you expect usually when film get make about medium grab unsolved crime the result movie tend to be overtly sensational and at best remotely connect to what really happen consider that director david fincher last film about serial killer be the gripping but deeply disturb se7en his take on the zodiac killer almost seem primed to be an extreme nail bite thriller instead what he give us be well argued thesis on the possible identity of the zodiac while there be some very intense scene fincher take somewhat unexpected approach on the subject all of the killing take place pretty early on in the movie with the bulk of the story center on the actual investigation into the killer by both the cop and cartoonist who become obsess with the case in fact the depiction of the murder be do in manner that be fairly reverent towards the victim while still convey the cruelty of them some people may find themselves disappoint by this two and half hour epic if they go in expect the usual serial killer fare but it a must see for any fan of fincher work or anybody who like good detective story
the great trick ever pull be to make anyone believe this film have coherent story believe the target audience and maybe even the writer be all 14 year old boy who think magician can do anything they want love good sci fi set and can accept some really fringe premise if the movie exploit them in good way this movie just relies on the audience swallow everything and never question anything if you start to pull any of the many loose end it all fall apart faster than you can say bullshit want to write this whitout spoiler but the plot have give me itch can not scratch first they steal 140 million by know the guy first pet name do they suggest the bank secure their asset with simple password recovery scheme like that don begin to understand be they seriuous why didn they just say they hypnoticed him into withdraw the money even thow that be not possible it be far more believable this be maybe the most unbeliveble way to explain heist ever heard of there be not singel interesting or plausible event in the whole film everything be just random the fbi guy do he base his whole career on this single moment that be determenation and plan out of this world but guess its whole lot easy to say its just distraction and magic that do it all would say that convince people to pay for this crap be far great con than any of the one present in the movie have see allot of bad movie but they all have something if find interesting or good in them except this one cant find any thing positive to say stay clear
bloody excite and amaze on all account steve mcqueen the number one bad as of his time aside from clint eastwood of course so what wrong with root for the bad guy this movie seem almost flawless with its excellently execute car chase it suspenseful and exciting shoot out and its riveting emotional sequence both mcgraw and mcqueen make this movie well worth the experience while it be violent movie especially for the year it be release its moment of comic relief and even serenity make this movie worthy of any moral person eye without spoil the movie just imagine bonnie and clyde with the great action adventure experience ever and to think it be over measley 500 000 of course they be be chase for 750 000 9 10 for an adventure close to perfection
good movie until the final few scene goreng awakes as prisoner in the hole vertical prison with two inmate per floor the inmate be feed by platform that travel from the top floor to the bottom the survival of the people on the low level be thus dependent on how much the people above them eat this be not ideal and result in prisoner on the low level starve to death killing and eat each other or commit suicide goreng decides to change thing for the good novel plot that take while to gain momentum the first 30 minute or so just seem like gross out horror movie be start to lose interest when twist massively change the direction the movie be take from then on it become very intrigue it also develop into decent social commentary not perfect one some of the aspect of the hole can be link to everyday society still enough to make it interesting and think provoke though the plot develop in very exciting fashion from this point the middle third or so be rivet action pack roller coaster ride still not perfect hat gorengs hallucination feel they be just pad they add nothing to the movie everything be set up for profound or at least satisfy end when the plot take an obscure turn that derail everything the end be pointless massive damp squib that ruin the movie ultimately very disappointing as this could have be great

love and duplicity robert zemeckis have mostly make audience please movie wan na hold your hand back to the future who frame roger rabbit forrest gump cast away he occasionally opt for more mature content such as 2012 flight ally be of the latter nature although like the former group it look to the past for inspiration brad pitt play canadian intelligence officer during wwii who go to casablanca where else to kill the german ambassador while there he hook up with marion cotillard resistance fighter and they eventually get marry but once they move to england he learn that there something that he didn know about her the movie make sure to set the stage with the era music and costume but the most important part remain the moral dilemma that pitt character face it not any sort of masterpiece but the acting make up for the movie flaws much of the camera work help tell the story notice the scene where pitt look at cotillard in the mirror overall recommend it

it like black comedy but without too many punchlines it be kind of funny not creepy or scary the whole premise isn deep to me at all but understand some people get kick out of find meaning in artsy movie so power to them also don think m dumb for think the concept be bad but digress would recommend watch if you like little silly movie that mildly entertaining and might make you go wtf lol at some part other than the plot the cinematography be nice
i just love this movie just love this movie great beatles score wonderful surreal colourful animation the story about beatles try to save pepperland from the blue meany be complete nonsense but who care it a film that make you happy and remember all you need be love
have some adorable and eccentric cat which can be an enjoyable watch for feline lover but look like experimental cartoon from decade ago which it not the cat return 2002 can be adorable but to me it be huge disappointment the concept be precious and amuse but the overall quality of the film make me think be this really studio ghibli production the ridiculous and amateurish visuals make it look like experimental cartoon from decade ago which it not it be too far from what expect least from spin off of one of my favorite animated feature and from one of the world most renowned studio however this film do have some adorable and eccentric cat which can be an enjoyable watch for feline lover like me but still can say that truly enjoy or even like this film in fact be appal to watch this most of the time everything seem to be unpleasant perhaps the art be not as beautiful or the storyline be not meaningful as the other film thankfully it a pretty short film with sweet end
this be good movie but it be not pride and prejudice any version of pride and prejudice get nod from me because the book be so dear to me but this be not pride and prejudice as jane austen write it it a good short story version of the book but the character be not develop at all which be the cornerstone of jane austen write it be hard to follow give the length of the movie and the character do not say what be write in the book also miss be the two bingley sister which be capital to the book the character sometime speak the english of the day and sometimes not it be fast and furious at first with mr bennett be so bold as to go up to mr darcy and introduce herself and her daughter in that time she would never do that then it slow way down when elizabeth visit pemberly and m not sure why and let not forget the pond scene which be totally miss from this version the pond scene and they way elizabeth and mr darcy make love just by their eye after she perform at pemberly be well worth watch the 1996 version if you want to see pride and prejudice as movie do yourself and jane favor and watch the bbc 1996 version with colin firth as mr darcy and jennifer ehle as elizabeth not to mention mrs bennett be definitely good hand down now that be pride and prejudice as write by jane austen this version be not true to the spoken english as jane write it it go in and out of the english spoken as in the book it be not true to the story which be no fault of the movie because movie need to be 1 1 2 hour long which can not do jane austen book justice please take the time and let yourself get sweep away by colin firth and jennifer ehles portrayal of elizabeth and darcy you will be glad that you do
a largely entertaining but deeply flawed action thriller ben affleck act resurgence of the last few year argo go girl his take on batman notch up another tick in the box this time with an introspective and multi layered turn as the titular black market bookkeeper who battle autism assassin and federal agent an intricately woven thriller boast multiple twist and turn of vary predictability there enough meat on the narrative bone to compensate for the over utilisation of rote flashback and the occasional slip into genre cliché the autism angle certainly lend fresh viewpoint on old trope but the film never feel completely confident to commit become selective about when it depict the mental condition wart and all and when it tame it down to suit the scene that possibly an unfair criticism though as this movie be an action thriller first and foremost and damn good one at that the set piece be mix of scrappy hand to hand fight à la the bourne series and gunplay that emphasise practicality similar to that display in john wick combine to create sequence that be both brutal and stylish thankfully the edit isn as impatient as it can be in lot of action flick with shot hold on the recognisable actor just long enough to convince you they re do their own stunt whilst the booming sound design give the sniper scenes an extra bit of chest pummel oomph it a shame the otherwise exciting finale be at time light so dimly it like you re view it with sunglass on as it detract slightly from what could have be an epic climax but hey that a minor quibble share the screen with affleck jon bernthal wild streak come out to play in another menacing badass role and k simmons be dependably magnetic as lead agent with secret past however anna kendrick kooky number cruncher seem to have walk in from completely different movie pitch perfect 3 perhaps it by no mean flawless yet the high calibre action grip central performance and few plot base surprise make the accountant largely satisfying cinematic outing
notably awful wow be truly the only word to describe this movie and not in good way first the animation be clearly cheaply do and look more like fifteen minute show on cartoon network than film leonard nemoy do give his voice talent however mountrouds voice be horribly annoy especially after about an hour of watch the film the story be bad and extremely confuse especially for youngster also the educational trip through time fails to mention all hallows eve the real history of halloween oh yeah and forget about the redeeming message in this film m still try to figure that out friendship maybe hmm all together terrible movie for adult and child alike do yourself favor and rent out disney film 2 10

disappoint from start to finish bohemian rhapsody have everything to be great biopic the story of singer freddie mercury be rich and different from many who live in show business and at the time of the emergence of stadium mega band in the twentieth century by itself be exotic guy who be bear in zanzibar africa spend his childhood in india and then be force to immigrate to england because of revolution in his country begin to study design and suddenly join with quasi dentist quasi physicist and an almost mechanical engineer to set up band that would be hit maker in the 70s and 80s but bohemian rhapsody be lazy film that do not deliver even the basic which would be facetious linear biopic base on historical moment of the band and its vocalist it be superficial erratic work that add nothing new or relevant to the biography of queen or freddie himself one of the great voice in rock history the film for example touch on important issue that deserve to be far explore ready few why be freddie relationship with the family so cold and fill gap how be your childhood in zanzibar and india where by the way do he start play piano what kind of influence could he have suffer from this life in these two place in what family immigration influence him or not to be what he become why deny the name and origins these be question that could have be ask and be not answer in the film his family be almost tip in history freddie own relationship with his homosexuality as well as his internal conflict lack and solitude be not properly treat harness to try to understand who freddie be in short it a very little delivered movie of course the production suffer several problem initially freddie would be play by sacha baron cohen but divergence with guitarist brian may and drummer roger taylor end up dynamite their participation the place end up be occupy by ramus malek know for his participation in the tv series mr robot but deliver freddie just acceptable and nothing remarkable after that bryan singer himself be fire from production with two week to go direction this one that fell in the lap of dexter fletcher but the film end up have the same face of singer late work with little depth in approach character and work short of expectation men apocalypse 2016 be an example in fact bohemian rhapsody only lend itself to queen good song especially those that represent turn point in the band career bohemian rhapsody love of my life we will rock you want to break free we be the champion another one bite the dust to bring comfort to the heart of the viewer it would have be more fruitful and cheap though to listen to queen great hit on spotify the screenplay by anthony mccarten and peter morgan who be responsible for such good film as the last king of scotland 2005 the queen 2006 frost nixon 2008 and rush 2013 also sin by not provide basic information put rock in rio in random time and space between 1975 and 1985 and create bad dialogue nor do it seem that there be band there create great hit and even these moment of creation of the musician sound fake and soulless if malek be far from strike but do not compromise gear that be flaw from begin to end the actor who make the other member of the band always see through the narrative with extreme generosity be weak gwilym lee brian may ben hardy roger taylor joseph mazzello john deacon be there to not compromise and be the sober piece of freddie mercury egotrip meanwhile entrepreneur paul prenter allen leech be depict as the villain in the film responsible for the friction between freddie and the rest of the band and even for his temporary separation so bohemian rhapsody go through its 2h15min owing lot his most memorable moment turn out to be malek scene in the rain when freddie decide to leave the bottom of the pit to resume his career with queen and the historical presentation in 1985 live aid key point for the band and freddie in context where the singer have just learn that he have aid disease that would eventually contribute to his death six year later but unfortunately all of queen timeline in the movie do not even hit 70 of what actually happen just as the viewer leave the cinema without even know the name of disc of the band singer by the way choose to put fake queen pocket show inside the film to portray the performance at live aid do not know if that be the best option it seem like lazy option to me for it be not movie or real queen show bring noise everywhere so bohemian rhapsody end with the false feeling of come out on top when in fact it leave more hole and bit of entertainment in an absolutely expendable movie
very boring disappointing oh my god the avenger be big disappointment to me can believe how doll and bore be during the 2 hour and 20 minute playtime of the movie the directing be so bad and think the director think the audience be so stupid or retard to believe those cheap story line or cheap joke or even cheap plot the script be so cheap and boring and the character didn blend with each other at all m not even impress by the special effect of the movie think men 3 or spider man show lot more special effect than this one nearly enjoy the last scene of the entire movie but this be not enough for such movie who earn unbelievable high rating finally when knew that the director have never direct such super hero movie and he have only direct for the tv like buffy series know why this movie suck still can believe how it get 8 6 really
it do not work well be sure surprised watchman be not your average superhero movie but it try to be more only fall short or actually long watchman be still superhero movie and it be still an adaptation an adaptation that make it look like the director be pull his hair with every turn of the page that be the impression have all along this overlong feature forget about transition in this movie it do not exist snyder look like he glue scene together at one point but my issue be not even that the story have too much low compare to high with an overdose of lesson be learn by our superheroes from begin to end too preachy for my taste on the positive side it keep you wonder when will it all stick and it do at the end in term of fantasy can say m amaze but it o spoiler people be say it complex have to differ as complexity without substance be just complication dr manhattan on the brink of nuclear war go into mid life crisis his gf dump him and guilt eats him up inside so he forget about earth an peace and fly to mar so in order to have an end the doctor have to fall into depression hmmmm so overall watchman be miss for curiosity purpose may be worth watch

there be no excuse good kid movie should have the ability to not only capture the child interest but also the parent look at movie like the incredibles madagascar shrek and up they all have comedy that suit both child and adult they be fun to watch for people of any age the argument that this be just kid movie be not valid child deserve smart movie than this this movie be just collection of horrible one liner and the top 40 pop music chart songs that make up its soundtrack there be nothing in this movie that have any sort of value watch it if you like animal guess or maybe not cause after this movie don think like guinea pig very much
consistently slow and rather unentertaining for what it offer jason statham and robert de niro both have their respective fan base they both have make film that have define their career do anyone ever expect to see these two pair up in an action spy thriller mmmmm hard to say it also hard to say what convince both of these actor to even consider play role in this story it questionable to what really work in this film there be plus but in the end it doesn satisfy like the trailer originally promote the story be base off of book write by ranulph fiennes claim about secret agency of highly trained killer set out to right the wrong of someone else trouble at least that what could be understood and this be where the movie just doesn work the story be very messy convolute and long both writing and direct position be give to first timer matt sherring screenplay of the book be very disorient for the first quarter of the film the set consistently change from country to country no more than minute each the audience will feel like there isn a real footing in where the story take place add to that be gary mckendry direction which follow sherring hopscotch write along with that come some weak character development stathom and de niro play duo who have history together in the business of kill others but not enough information be truly give on either character de niro character state he have family and child but be never explain to how his family deal with what he do same go for statham his wife girlfriend she be never label originally there be friction between them about not be fully open about one life but then by the 3 4 mark the topic be just drop ummm ok also there really wasn much chemistry between the actor big reason for this be that de niro be barely on screen his presence be only about fifth of the running time also statham character have other connection that he use throughout the plot which aren give much of background either it kind of strange that advertise it as de niro and statham film you expect to see them quite frequently but no what be interest to watch in this film be the overall area that the story finally take place in as the plot finally settle this movie come off more as british make film than american kind of like stand off 2013 where the majority of actor be irish for here the majority of actor be british it a different listen experience especially when various american word be replace with british jargon it give the audience something to pay attention too along with that lead to clive owen who isn anymore define as character as to statham or de niro yet owen character be perhaps more fun to watch because of his stiff upper lip discolor eye bushy mustache and british accent owen also get into multiple scuffle with statham because well that the action orient part of the movie to say the action be bad wouldn be appropriate the action scene be well execute and somewhat inventive but since the character aren define well enough it can be hard for viewer to really appreciate who the protagonist be fight attempt to help elevate the entertainment be reinhold heil and johnny klimek score to the film their music do contain some piece that be relative to the scene at hand but also contain frequent screeching violin and that may annoy listener it not poorly make but it could use improvement all of it be just average the entire crew to this film try from the actor to music department but the inconsistent plot lack control and focus to what little it have to begin with make just an average action film

heat not so hot hollywood have new genre of film comedy that don have any laugh in them actually this genre have be around for while and this simply the late in long line sandra bullock use to be good actress but nowadays she be just another journeyman woman make movie for paycheck the heat be basically just series of scene from other good movie we have the at odds with the bos scene the scene that identify our two heroine as be misunderstand by all their colleague the get drunk together bond scene the silly dance scene the stepping on the toe of another law enforcement agency scene the turning from shrew into mean mother scene the capture by the bad guy scene the escape from the bad guy scene the capture the bad guy in the nick of time and save someone scene and finally the former screw up get medal scene collection of movie clichés without any empathy at all with the audience do we care about any of the heroine know didn one cop who swear all the time and treat her bos like dirt and the other the polar opposite oh how we laugh as these two find common ground and begin to work together for the good of the community no wait minute we didn laugh as there be not one remotely funny scene in the whole movie what rubbish film
fun m shock by these lousy review what be people expectation this be not casablanca far good than the last two in the series in line with the fun of the first one it a fun movie fun movie do mention that it a fun movie so for anyone look for some fun this one for you for anyone who be interested in celebrity excess and know what the met gala be absolutely do not miss this don take it seriously but have fun
have have worse personally find this movie wrong and stupid from every possible angle though it wasn the excitement nor the interest have pull through til the end be heroic task to be honest the idea and the basic plot be promise one too bad they have to screw up at every key point the actor and actress have no chemistry and the lead character be downright annoy irrelevant side plot like why be it important to share the info on the debt of the father why be uncle matt force into the movie with cheesy exuse just to be kill 5 and 35 minute later not to mention the boyfirend stupidity all over the place and both our hero and the attacker fell into this hole every single time mean mon be not even go into the typical mistake and stupidity happen in most of the horror movie but why be force to accept that the tragic hero ine in this movie should be the whiny little brat who have absolutely no interpersonal skill make no sense in any conversation whine and cry through 90 minute of the movie and do absolutely no contribution towards escape or in any way improve their situaition she then explore the fact that the bad guy target her and want her to rise from her prison to be much more to release her true power yep like that gon na happen with pregnant minor and even after this point she fail to contribute to their situation in any way her brother on the other hand be the only one be able to kill one of the attacker despite the fact he didn even wash his hand after pee and also there the camera question mean how many camera be instal about hundred and yet you can notice one single camera but you can notice patch of paint still fail to comprehend you ve get ta be super stupid guy sorry to have to hear this from me lack of violence blood suspense and any horror element okay there be like 2 jumpscare scene but literally that all the movie be unfold so slow and use so cliché element so that actually all the suspense and fear be kill off the way of kill people be not creative at all except may be one but be still not convinced if that be proper way of kill someone all in all the movie itsel be like horror make for kid under the age of 12 the 3 star be for try only but the fun stop there the result do not worth your time well go and watch saw episode 156
good than be expect so be huge horror fan be try to find one haven watch don usually give these kind of horror chance so glad do on this one wasn expect it to be any good at first be think oh here we go another crap horror with bunch of unheard of actor stick with it absolutely love this movie there few bad point but overall really entertaining horror and you re really root for the main character all the way through the end be good than expect too glad they didn ruin it
first minute ruin it only watch one minute but couldn continue past it it be awful terrible music right off the bat plus terrible animation wish could watch more but why would want to this movie make me want to quit watch instantly can give it chance if they don even try at the beginning
unbelievably overrate saw this movie when it first come out in 1982 be in my early twenty at the time so could understand the thing in this film basically stereotype didn like the film then and the only reason would suggest that anyone see it now be for 80 nostalgia always think that this be an empty film pretend to be funny which it isn and try to have some kind of message it nothing but cheap trashy bad bad taste as oppose to good bad taste which like teen exploitation movie masquerade as something special from it reputation one would think this be some work of brilliance the character be shallow and dull and could never figure out how people love the ridiculous stone out surfer character so much now if this film have not take itself seriously or perhaps be write as put on or satire of high school or even teen movie and teen pop culture in general circa 1982 such as the brilliant lord love duck do back in 1966 it very likely would have be something much well or even truly great in my opinion if you want to see something teen orient which be far superior see heather or definitely rock roll high school or even ferris bueller day off
sorry to be downer but here what think of casablanca do not like casablanca wait before m burn at the stake hear me out one of the problem have with casablanca be that it try to exist on two different plain it expect us be draw into the emotional struggle that rick undergoes throughout the movie but no matter how hard try and believe me want to love this movie the film fail on the emotional level rick as play by humphrey bogart seem horrifically ingenuine he continually spew out dialogue which pander even insult the audience stick my neck out for no one rick never drink with anyone etc etc these line be definitely memorable but capable actor could have communicate rick veneer of cynicism without word and trust the audience intelligence to figure it out indeed it be this constantly simplistic dialogue as well as the cardboard performance by bogart that continually hold me back couldn plunge into the emotional power of the film as want to and indeed begin to grow annoy by the film because it seem as if it didn believe its own conviction it seem as if it would rather be hip than genuine the film be not without its strong point definitely the great performance by bergman rain and wilson the surehanded direction of curtiz and the memorable song as time go by but casablanca fail to draw me in emotionally and also fail to invoke the feeling of casablanca at that time compare to great film like the third man which invoke the paranoia of cold war vienna schindler list the closing wall of the holocaust and save private ryan the chaos of war casablanca fail miserably in comparison whenever see casablanca be always little sadden it could have be great and profound film instead it be mediocre escapist entertainment
entertain but stupid like the idea when be kid like this series but now find it stupid not the idea of the smart car but more about the story but then there be lot of stupid tv series that be great in those time but become stupid right now usually they re still enjoyable at the beginning and start get stupid in the middle
very enjoyable guilty pleasure far from perfect with its simplistic script cheap concert recreation rush third act it still very enjoyable guilty pleasure iwon rheon douglas booth be both very good might ve worked good as limited series
matrix but in dreamworld nah d like to keep my review rather to the point pros 1 its theme dream be fascinate topic to say the least there be lot of unknown in dreamworld 2 its plot there be several sweet twist and unpredictable turn 3 its edgy drive although you know what come next still you feel jumpy about it when it do 4 its rapid storyline the story move fast from one scene to another make the viewer feel like on roller coaster ride at time it hard to keep up even after watch it several time 5 its sophistication there be lot of information to remember and digest this be the very thing the modern moviegoer be after believe 6 its realism okay pun intend the movie explain or at least try to the in and out of what dream be about and how it function some of which be very familiar with and dear to us con 1 its poor character development although the acting be convince enough there be not enough of character development wonder how many people really felt connect to the main character after watch the movie yes the movie talk about emotional struggle but it be more of an action film than anything else if you ask me 2 too many distraction find that the movie have more character than necessary they may play certain role in the plot but they seem more of distraction than anything else wish the movie be more focused 3 bit preachy notice that the character would explain thing about dreamworld and then the exact thing happen later in the movie m afraid inception overuse this trick in conclusion its theme be fascinate but its delivery be not without room for improvement highly recommend you to go and read somewhere carnal over 40 wink if you dig this kind of flick cheer
a tad bore unfortunately his life be not necessarily biopic worthy not much go on good to watch documentary it more gay love story without depth the cinematography be beautiful but not mindblowing
awful omg didnt think would make it till the end but somehow survive the fighting scene be horrendous you could tell there be lot of edit in the fighting scene this be movie for ppl who already know about the bird of prey bore would not watxh again
irritating and unfinished plot if somebody read the book he might understand more and even like the film but if you never read the book or if you even do not see any trailer you will be upset or bore at least massively irritated johansson do nearly not talk have nearly always the same face it do not come out what and why she be do what she do and what do the motorcycle guy have to do with it why be it show how he cross scene in no moment it will be clear what be happen why the actor act how he act neither it will be clear after the film find its sudden end want my money back film save the money
surface be great but this film could easily have fill 2 5 hour of content why do it only last 1 5 want more back story want more character development especially toward the end want to know more about what happen and how will smith character be deal with it in short just want more all in all this film leave me feel lot like do in spider man 3 lot happen but none of it be really explain it a shame really because the concept be golden and will smith film usually feel quite epic and full ll definitely pick up the novel hopefully it will give me the depth that want

there be good reason they call the novel unfilmable watchman my favorite book of all time one of the most famous graphic novel ever write its depth and meaningfulness almost unbearably grand and who be choose to direct the film adaptation zack snyder the guy who become famous for remake dawn of the dead and direct 300 now don get me wrong quite enjoyed both these film but couldn anybody see who unsuitable he be to make watchman his film be visually outstanding but none of them have the plot and character depth that watchman require first saw the trailer the second it emerge on the internet the shot be promise but nothing be really revealed smart trick that make me pay 8 to watch it but from the first scene realize be in for very disappointing treat first want to point out that snyder do get some thing right the detailed set that portray alan moore alternate 1980 be really well make and so be the character costume but it seem that after the director take care of these two start derail from the graphic novel really do not know where to start with what be wrong the character although recite extract from the novel have lose their depth and become marionette travel from one visually majestic shot to the other the film become really violent and gory and really don mind that ve see much bad but the violence simply didn seem to fit it be pointless and graphically shoot in similar way to zack snyder previous film without though serve any cause many important scene be savagely shorten in order to make the fighting scene longer rorschach narration although extract from the book be turn into another cliché low voice tough guy narration that remind me of so many other film like sin city and the spirit the plot be also inexplicably change in so many way that distort almost every single one of the book message zack snyder do not shoot the novel adaptation he just use the atmosphere and alternate reality create by the genius of alan moore to create his own piece of visual extravaganza and use its background to promote it and just to make thing clear this film be not just bad adaptation of the novel it be really disappointing film in general and my friend who have not read the book agree with me his three hour epic be visually amazing just like 300 be but simply do not work with the plot this story deserve well film but hope nobody attempt to make it again
overall boring unfunny and plain unintelligent cant believe this movie this be what you get when you mix lazy unoriginal idea with overall boring plot im not go to say anything for you but nearly every joke in the movie you probably have hear million time this make you not even smile the movie be very immature crack body joke every other minute and have very lame plot which we have see million time where they be try to save the forest blah blah the mix of animation and real life character just make it embarrass to look at also the 3d be crude and doesn have any interesting moment grant the actor be talented but this movie be piece of filth save yourself the trouble and pick another movie even kid wont find this poor movie amusing
every cliché in the book read the hobbit in school even as twelve year old think it be childish obviously never read lord of the ring have no problem with fantasy as other post of mine on this site show the problem with this book or film however be that it be accord such status as implies it to be worthy of regard as in some sense serious work of art concentrate here on the film find the whole enterprise grindingly tedious and even quite objectionable from the unending detailed narration at the start onwards as we jump to hobbiton we be accost by the jeepy jerky lilt of the cliché movie land oirish folk music every moment of this struck me as dreadful lie may not have read lotr but know some thing about it background tolkien use as his source paradigm for the shire reference to the culture of south west england particularly around somerset that be why it be call the flaming shire like wilt shire hamp shire gloucester shire for pete sake where the hell do all this yip pity yo line dance soundtrack come from not to mention the smattering of character with ginger hair and american irish accent it be as though the need be felt to accommodate the kind of american audience for whom bucolic innocence be only conceivable in term of the hollywood old country of the quiet man these people be anyway nothing like hobbit they resemble regular caucasian with pointy ear and bit of hair on their nearly normal size foot they be too clean hobbiton here positively gleams with newness clean than any place have be to in the real world as have not visit switzerland bilbo palatial warren have the gleam un lived look of scene in furniture catalogue no dust no dirt and no wear or tear in sight this be more the subterranean show home of an environmentalist billionaire than the modest under hill burrow of an impecunious hominid ground hog that it be suppose to be the music get even bad for one thing the repeat cheaply manipulative interjection of few sentimental bar of sibelius for another the kind of dreadful fake liturgical choristing that we associate with film such as the omen this even employ an old oh so very old movie technique of pattern line of music to sound like line of text most famously evident in lon chaney werewolf in which the orchestra sound like it be say the be wolf the be wolf the be wolf here it come up to grate effect when the black rider appear and the fake latin choir seem to sound like the evil it here the evil it here the evil it here clichés clichés everywhere take the design of thing resemble as it do the kind of celtic and gothic clichés one see in the work of tattoo parlour these past twenty tear liv tyler pendant that she waffle on about at length in awed term look like something you would buy for fiver in the high street comic shop the architecture festoon with ridiculously useless point and wing seem to come straight from the doodlings make by bored schoolboy during friday afternoon chemistry class then the over blown battle scene if there be that many creature willing to go to their death in middle earth where the hell be they the rest of the time the place seem to be empty until war start when fifty million cgi battle fodder suddenly show up to do service from nowhere as if by magic more grating irritating feature elisha wood perpetually perplexed look after while really begin to irritate part of my anatomy begin with t the action be mostly talk the story positively rrrr aa g sss along when something happen it be usually more talk however the film be not simply tedious boring and unimaginative find that it be positively distasteful the story be present as some kind of vehicle of wisdom and morality but it be precisely there that it be at it weak the world we be show revolves around magic but contain no religion the creature fret continually about spell and invisible force yet they appear to have no moral framework no compass of ethic no church and no worship good and evil be present as self evident like day and night the evil be ugly ugly people be evil be that wisdom question of practise be reduce to argument about tactic obviously the convention of white hat black hat be customary in the cinema but usually present only as escapist entertainment here it be imply that we should attach some significance to proceeding such significance be the very attitude that plague politics in the s and western europe where follower of one ideological camp see anyone who disagree with them as self evidently stupid misguide even evil and worthy of death threat lotr hit the big time in the sixty as an unofficial green book of hippiedom this be at the heart of it vision as here find in the film in this story only the bad guy the evil one use technology we see this assert in the patently industrious mien of their kingdom all forge and furnace and cauldron brim with production contrast to the bucolic literally airy fairy aspect of the land of the good in fact that world of industry have forge the ring be implicitly assert to be the very source of all that be evil in the world this film proselytise for rousseaesque fantasy of pre lapsarian innocence and moral virtue an attitude that refuse to accept the harsh truth of nature renounces humanity tool of advancement and abrogate the harsh responsibility that be necessary for survival this be the very mind set that be today in the real world threaten the survival of western industrialise civilisation the only civilisation with the leisure and free resource to indulge in such fantasy
disappointment even for the mild f fan this movie start off really well however it be set off course after the action start have to warn those that watch the trailer on television because they spoil every excite scene from the movie would not consider myself an avid fan but have follow the series ever since the first movie and would be the first one to tell you that this movie be major disappointment after tokyo drift the director rely heavily on action and random filler to please the audience while leave the fan frustrate and confuse and since when do the acronym f turn from fast and furious to fast and fight this series have start it root from race and form into another predictable action movie now to the ridiculous part of the review the last scene with the cargo jet be beyond unrealistic this scene be around 15 minute long and would like to point out that the take off speed of vast jet like that be around 150 200 mph not to mention they have to increase speed in order to take off due to the added weight the runway must be around 50 mile long because they be on there for literally 15 minute travel at an average speed of 150mph and don even get me start with the whole gisele die scene the director get rid of her fast than all those 8 powered engine put together point out bit of information what the reviewer carl walster miss he do an amazing job to point out how really ridiculous the movie really be have great imagination but this movie be too difficult to comprehend and how could some of these other reviewer say this be the best of fast and furious that blasphemous
many will not want some of this in my opinion if you re over 25 there be good chance you will not enjoy this movie when we saw the preview in the theater my wife and think this movie would need good review if we be ever go to see it it look like complete loser but how could it be that bad if it be make by richard linklater who make boyhood that we love when the critic review come out they be almost universally positive with metascore of 84 and the imdb user score be around 8 0 the time be convenient the theater arclight in bethesda be our favorite the washington post critic ann hornaday who have lose lot of my trust give it three star and good writeup how could it be that bad maybe should have notice that nearly 10 of the raters on imdb give it 1 the actor in the film most of whom be unknowns do good job the filming be very good but the story what little there be of one be real loose it center on the male bonding of group of baseball scholarship athlete at college in texas it take place during three day before the start of the fall semester in 1980 the first 75 of the film consist primarily of party drink try to hookup more partying more drinking etc the last 25 where real story begin to develop be good rate movie on enjoyment for instance horrible boss which get mixed review give 9 it be very enjoyable and get lot of laugh from it hat birdman which have high rating similar to everybody want some ve come to the conclusion that you can trust the professional critic and you can always trust user on imdb the question be can you trust my wife and me who see about 100 movie year in the theater you decide

lame movie don get teaser so spoiler intend watch shaun of the dead or shawn always confuse the spelling while back people after watch the movie start say it be refresh comedy and very very funny well take look and it be mildly amuse but most of the advertisement my buddy should probably work for medium marketing by mu friend fell short this movie however the trailer do not grab me but be willing to watch as the previous movie make be decent movie should have realize that the trailer and the preview for this movie be somewhat desperate as many movie get mr deed for eg and decide to watch it be glad wasn pay for this flick but can tell you that this movie be more chaotic and very plaid how the hell do you get distract for an hour and half with popcorn that be the first for me the joke be too mild and there be nothing good about the story either mean if no one can see that the main chief of the the hq along with some other key ppl be the villain in the movie it ok if you don guess the few of the townsfolk as conspirator then you need to put the crack pipe down this movie be very disappointing and just go down the hole far the only funny part saw be be towards the end where he kick an old lady in the face hence my score for this movie be 4 but after proof read my comment the movie deserve to have two more point take off so hence it be 2 star movie which most likely should be watch free no offense to anyone who like the movie but still think its not worth put your pop corn down and watch at the movie until it end
overhype much this be emotional manipulation at its core and the problem be that it terribly execute withou any sort of originality or respect for the audience there be creative way to get an emotional response from viewer besides slow motion and sad sountrack in key moment the movie be competently shot and can complain about the performance of the main character on the other hand the little girl be terrible and the furthest from fluid and believable even in child acting standard if you can see through the emotion the filmmaker be shove down your throat this be pretty underwhelming experience
doesn live up to potential felt obligate to write review because felt all of the negative review focus on the wrong aspect of the movie first want to take step back and state that base on the trailer any viewer of the film should have be aware that they be go to be deal with psychopath as the main character think jake gyllenhaal performance of this character be extremely well do no one should have problem with this furthermore throw realism out of the window the amount of obviously illegal thing lou bloom do without get caught be nearly insulting so the end didn surprise me whatsoever on the other hand m get frustrate by the amount of people label this as brilliant satire if anything suppose it could be very poorly write satire would say that there be indeed satirical moment in the film but think it be more appropriately label as thriller infuse with dark comedy since the entire piece simply doesn function as complete satire have another huge qualm with the score don know how everyone isn comment on the corny score of the movie film such as this need powerfully ominous score and while you could cite the score as be catalyst for the satirical model of the film for example when the triumphant music play while bloom move the body could counter with the fact that this film be not wholeheartedly satirical m fan of satire but feel that if the film present itself as dark expose of what lou bloom do for work with the satire be completely drive by the script itself then it would ve function quite well otherwise it be underwhelming but worth give look for the sake of gyllenhaal performance and very gripping cinematography
start to get boring like very bore first 3 season of the show be great but now it start to get boring and unbearable to watch with iris call herself the leader of team flash caitlin would make good leader if they really want one the show lose it after season 3
harmful fun have see this film umpteen time and see the very polarized opinion it generate here be the fact as see them it be an entertaining film whilst gibson be as wooden as usual other member of the cast be good particularly the under rat mcgoohan the battle sequence whilst inaccurate be carry off well and visually it all look great so it be pity that an otherwise good film be spoil by it sadly one side view of history firstly edward behave no differently to any other monarch of the time in protect his interest he be arguably the most effective ruler during turbulent period of civil war in england itself his son the unfortunate edward ii be lucky to have outived his father at all the crown have to be protect at all cost the scot as well as the english perpetrate some terrible deed but this be typical of the time and practice such as break on the wheel continue in france into the 18th century as in most conflict no party have moral high ground it be inevitable that scotland would become vassal of england in the same way that france be eventually enlarge at the time wallace may have represent an ideal of clan freedom and independence but the nation state be already become the currency of power within europe more balanced and investigative approach would have yield more satisfying result and leave less bitter aftertaste for viewer of an english disposition i
grosser than its predecessor and unfortunately short on laugh hot tub time machine be one of my favorite stoner comedy know it doesn technically fall under that category but the style of humor be similar to movie like harold kumar in that it dumb humor gross out gag and just unbridled ridiculousness and that fun to me hot tub time machine 2 keep that same formula but unfortunately it miss few key thing that make the first one so great first be the novelty factor we ve see these guy time travel before so the whole explaining time aspect isn all that interest second there no consistency the first movie have plot it be an adventure from start to finish and you be with these character the whole way it be straightforward and it work here they try to save lou from be kill by go back in time to stop the killer but instead they go forward in time and apparently the killer be from that time and end up go back in time to kill lou or something it just dumb convolute plot not that plot be important in comedy it just help to have some sort of narrative to follow instead of scene after scene of ridiculousness and third and most importantly hot tub time machine 2 be miss john cusack he hold the first movie together like glue he play adam likable everyman that the audience could relate to and it help that he have some of the funny line in the movie this movie be all over the place without him lou be now the main character and as much as love rob corddry his character get really old really fast his entire character revolves around gross out humor and shock value and it work wonder in the first httm because adam sense of reason help balance it out jacob be now the only voice of reason but he lou son and serve as the punch line to lot of joke in the movie sometimes it work sometimes it doesn adam scott be the newcomer playing adam jr the son of john cusack character the gang meet adam jr in the future and he end up go on the adventure to find lou killer with them love adam scott and he be fine in this movie but he didn really add anything noteworthy to the group dynamic he play geeky character who about to get married then on their adventure as you can imagine drug get consume and mistake be make he definitely provide some laugh and the group be still enjoyable to watch for the most part but you can definitely feel void in the character department the most important thing about comedy be obviously the laugh and this movie have few much of the dialogue feel like shock value for the sake of be crude again it work sometimes other time not so much everything be do well in the first film this definitely feel like cash grab movie especially since they didn even bother ask john cusack to return because they know they have to pay him sh tload of money although he do have nice little cameo in the unrated version but all in all it not terrible it a run of the mill raunchy comedy with some funny moment and lot of disgust one it worth maybe one time watch if you be fan of the first one you ll find some good chuckle here and there and if you haven see the first one then you might enjoy this even more because you have nothing to compare it to as far as sequel go it could have be lot bad the fact remain though that hot tub time machine 2 be simply unnecessary

the definition of masterpiece don know how to start movie review off see as ve never write one feel my meager rating out of ten be enough information to tell those interested what think of particular movie birdman however be the exception understand m an absolute stranger who give damn about what have to think my only hope be that after read one fan fanatic praise for birdman you will go and see it in the interest of not over hype this movie which many will feel m about to do will say it nothing short of utterly amazing every aspect of the film be masterfully craft and execute emmanuel lubezki cinematography only exemplify this the brilliant choice of always have the camera roll let the viewer see what happen before and after any give event this add information create realism unknown to nearly every other movie ever make what good way to capture the raw emotion and awkward stumbling of an angry outburst at your father than to show the immediate reaction of the ranter follow her outburst you get to see the anger slowly fade from her face as the reality of what she say set in detail like this be so often lose and these often lose immersive subtlety be what make birdman the gargantuan triumph it be not to mention some of the transition and dolly shot be just damn impressive even though many movie be yet to come out this pre oscar season feel it be safe to say no other cast ensemble will come close to the performance give in birdman michael keaton zach galifianakis emma stone ed norton amy ryan and every single other actor in the production execute their role with professionalism that most movie be lucky to see in just one of their actor each actor didn wait for their time to shine to pull out the big gun every moment of screen time be utilize to its full potential there isn a second where the audience immersion be break by an awkwardly delivered line or slightly out of place facial expression or emotion the only criticism have about the film be that more aren like it smart satirical movie that be capable of criticize without be hypocritical be unfortunately rare however it rather nice to have movie like this stand out from the crowd instead of be the norm because the relative quality only make them that much good so in short implore you beg you if you step into movie theater once this year let it be to watch this film it deserve your attention
fantastic direction in this indie gem have the great fortune of see yes god yes in the emerge director section of the st louis international film festival the film be pitch perfect and lead actress natalia dyer stranger thing carry the film with tension and humor will watch this film again and certainly recommend it as often as possible director karen maine mastery keep this film move forward with precision and never miss beat
people don know what to make of this film like many other people the reason come to watch wednesday be because it feature in the current imdb top 250 list the film be also necessary view for the top 250 list of 2016 and 2017 previously be quite confused and immediately sceptical as to why this 2008 indian film be only recently come into the spotlight for most other movie this usually indicate film of high quality however as my 5 10 average rating suggest wednesday be film far remove from the quality require to merit such position it be notable to say that of the 198 film have see of the current top 250 this film have receive the low rating from myself with that context in mind shall now talk about my assessment of the film the most egregious aspect of wednesday be definitely in the action set piece the physical confrontation one interrogation scene and another chase scene be woefully uncoordinated to the point of parody the acting in these scene fall under heavy scrutiny unfortunately as direct result of this and be entirely unconvincing the sound editing be perhaps the bad part of these scene it sound like it come directly from child toy soundboard it be so jarring that it would have undermine the action scene even if they have be well choreograph the special effect be also unconvincing but since it have minute presence it doesn hinder the film too greatly be also unaware if there be budgetary limitation the film have in its making so don think it would be entirely fair for me to condemn it for that luckily there be little action to corrupt the entire film but this have lead to some reviewer state that the film be boring office set piece as result d be incline to disagree as the film premise out with the action offer the great potential that the film ultimately fail to fully fulfil far but more pervasive flaw be in the film edit there be an overabundance of slow motion footage and abrupt cut however would say that although the film edit will come across as bit cheesy it be still of an adequate quality this could be as much case of time work against the film if anything although doubt that be the case will now address the more positive aspect that the film have to offer the acting from the main cast be decent for the most part anupam kher and naseeruddin shah play the police commissioner prakash rathod and the terrorist know only as the common man play off of each other well the script be decent and have some interesting dialogue one scene come to mind be rathod test his officer commitment to find the bomb be highlight but felt that the concept have lot more potential than its final product the villain motivation be interesting and certainly more 3 dimensional than your typical action movie however again felt that they could have go into more depth into his character the conclusion seem to inspire profound sense of patriotism in the indian people hence its high rating when the two star finally come together whilst understandable be bit disappointed that they didn go far with the moral conflict here and didn attempt to provide more nuanced argument the film remind me of the anime death note to some degree and be hop to see high stake battle of wit unfold similar to the like of and light yagami or between sherlock holmes and moriarty the secondary villain group of terrorist be play well enough but felt that they be more 1 dimensional in presentation d also finish by say that the cinematography for the film be suitably engage and the camera be dynamic enough to keep your concentration during the film slow segment d like to finish on more positive note as attempt to lend some support to this film notice that wednesday have 5 4 rating from the top 1000 voter on imdb with the high percentage 22 5 of those give the film rating of 1 10 in the same way that have criticise people who have overrate this film result in its unjust placement in the top 250 feel that also need to criticise those who be be equally unreasonable in their negativity objectively speak this film do lot of thing fairly well and others poorly thus warrant its 5 10 average rating from myself wednesday be competently enough make film with coherent story decent acting and cinematography etc so it could definitely be lot bad wonder how many top 1000 voter have see the imdb bottom 100 movie as frame of reference ve even see top 1000 voter give the like of jaw and the lord of the ring return of the king 1 10 rating to summarise this film be highly overrate on imdb and shouldn be on the top 250 at the same time it be decent enough movie which work well enough within its limitation doubt wednesday be make with the intent of become an all time great film just simple honest thriller find it moderately enjoyable if forgettable and think it should be recognise as such ask south asian reviewer to seriously reconsider the film that they be try to promote as the best of bollywood cinema film like this and andaz apna apna be really overrate and annoy and scare off westerner from watch your other film and that a massive shame there be good bollywood film out there like 3 idiot so try and promote these film instead please try and consider how your film will resonate with global audience know westerner should do the same but the sad fact be we can afford to do so because of the more global reach of hollywood to address westerner don take out your anger out on the film for its high rating it not its fault so just ask reviewer to be fair in their assessment if you re the kind of person to give this film 1 10 rating just to take it off of the top 250 then you re just be hypocritical be consistent and objective in your criticism and hopefully this will encourage others to do the same
just garbage moral of the story junk food and fast food be evil this be new no one have ever do this moral before ever just didn see that one come that message just punch me right in the face especially with tag line as clever and catchy as would you like lie with that get it instead of fry hahaha hilarity and yet clever and subtle and just smart or or the truth be hard to swallow that a clear warning sign that you re in for festival of condescend know it all message when they declare their own message truth or revelation of some sort how cocky and pretentious eh as far as the movie go from purely political or moral perspective it crap first of all it isn controversial at all despite the fact that they insist on try to make it seem as if it be it be controversial 30 year ago stop act like this be some spark to revolution or something for christ sake there isn really anything you didn know if you watch supersize me and read the book and have just in general not be lock in closet for the last 20 year without tv the message be old stale and uninteresting and because it a work of fiction anything bad that could happen do happen and then it get the ball sensationalized out of it to use this movie as piece of education would be like use terminator to ban research on robotics and ai so weak and stale point sensationalized argument and an arrogant and condescend tone oh you think this be why declare this movie garbage the story whoa nelly the story poor mexican border crossers get treat badly and butcher elite corporate guy sell crap to people and doesn care because he a corporate guy and that what corporate guy do because corporate evil and the teenager feel rebellious the acting be good but it can only mask the absolute shoddiness of the story to certain degree character be all on side the story be so obviously politically motivated and without emotion and the character barely if at all tie in to each other it just bad the only reason anyone be give this movie good review be because they agree with the moral before they even saw it they like that it smash at fast food just as much as they like to smash at it morally incline bias to the actual review of the movie that all it be this movie be indeed just plain fart smelly garbage
great movie for young viewer earth to echo in my opinion be the best movie ve ever see now be that m only 14 could mean huge difference for the old age group honestly think the movie be mean to lean toward young people but old age grouping might enjoy the movie still wrap myself around the main point of the movie don want to say anything because it would give it away but find it to be very inspirational film think anyone who be 12 30 would highly enjoy this movie the movie will really impact someone who think that long distance friendship relationship can happen give it 10 10 just because it be just that good
wahlberg the angry cop ok first off will say that the story be just ok but that usually happen in comedy so you have to rely more on the film try to make the viewer laugh if you be fan of will ferrell comedy and mark wahlberg then you will pretty much laugh throughout the film ferrell really get to act like himself in this film mean he be play character but he get to use his typical humor wahlberg play really angry cop and some of the thing that come out of his mouth will really get you laugh actually laugh more at wahlberg than ferrell samuel jackson and dwayne johnson be in the film bit as the head cop like new starsky and hutch they be entertain eva mendes play ferrell wife and she be actually entertaining then the chief of the police station be play by michael keaton throughout the movie he keep quote from the group tlc he be actually also pretty funny you will find yourself laugh lot throughout the film but there be some part where they do try to be serious and most of the time it can be turn off in good comedy there be some great one liner and scene that will stick in your mind so pretty good comedy and will end by say want to see mark mahlberg do more comedic role because he be pretty good in them
meh overrate think this be poor facsimile of the film noir genre with main character that have no rapore whatsoever and why danny devito be in this movie be beyond me he be so mis cast just like all the main star the writing be poor and the acting be stiff and as ve say about the direct it a poor facsimile of film noir or neo noir

1 out of 10 that say it all remember wait for this show weekly segment with such anticipation as child in the early 1980 to watch michael knight and his partner and friend kitt the car battle criminal for the foundation be such thrill today look at this show and recollect with embarrassment the reason why watch it the reason as child as to why watch this show be simple it be fast paced adventurous suspenseful but to top it all off it have one of the cool car know to man car that not only protect michael knight but engage in full conversation with him conversation such as michael masculine pursuit be hold up to scrutiny in the conversation and if my memory serve me correctly most of these chat be about michael roam eye and how every damsel would fall for him in each episode the adventure be many and the explosion and fistfight be plenty at the end of each episode we be all grateful that the west coast of america be safe thanks to one car and its occupant today however can see the child even be remotely interested in talk car or for that matter the occupant of these car maybe this be because the technology that be our imagination have become reality today and there be now no need for these date action show the imagination of today be now enthral by what could be the technology of tomorrow or be it that child and adult alike have have enough of the rubbish and unrealistic story line we don care about car that could never exist and if it do we would be able to afford it or worse it could become like the next delorien car have we have now have enough of the like of michael knight man whose stylish leather jacket and sun tan of the early 1980 would now be the object of scorn and pity today poser like michael knight would be bottle and beat and not tolerate and that be just what the feminist would do in this reviewer opinion yes knight rider be very much product of 1980 kitsch to watch re run like have today mean blush with embarrassment at the though that once find the dialog funny and cool the story line be wholly unbelievable and the method of prevent crime be totally ludicrous what worse be the fact that this show have have stigma far bad than the dodgy fashion and plot line this be david hasselhof person that be still on the v despite the fact he can not act and when he try it be just very embarrass to watch grant will admit it be very hard to upstage talk car even marlon brando would have great difficulty in that maybe be have become too cynical and not be fair to the show but be justify in my criticism in this review if you want to reminisce about television show from your childhood and have warm love tone when you do so then you can definitely find good one than this load of rubbish find that when me and my mate will discuss these show the team will always be refer to as our favorite where we will mimic character and talk about particular show whenever knight rider be mention we will stare at our drink vacantly in the hope that someone will change the subject quickly 1 out of 10

derivative and boring ve never read the book but go to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss be about the hunger game felt be complete bore the story unwind in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the character the plot line itself people of dystopian future be make to fight to the death on tv have be do to death no pun and do with more wit an imagination in the running man for instance the gladiator story be tell much well in real gladiator movie like gladiator and spartacus which be both hugely good than the hunger game for an action movie it feel like day go by before there be any real action the name actor like stanley tucci wes bentley and donald sutherland seem to be as bore as the viewer be with this material the unknown actor play the competitor be wooden when there be action it be usually with such herky jerky camera work that you can barely follow what be happen and there be some gaping plot hole spoiler alert the heroine be tree by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down and of course they snooze instead the simulated monster animal that can actually devour people most of the competitor be kill off camera come on
postmodern take on the story of mary be surprisingly more relevant today than when it be release this be fascinate film the story of modern day virgin mary deal with issue like human sexuality and the divinity as well as theme of intelligent design creationism be challenge for the viewer to say the least godard have always be way ahead of his time in term of formal aspect of film as well as socio political point of view this film be shoot in 1984 85 and he address issue that be very relevant to the contemporary resurgence of faith especially in american society today the fact that the professor teaching be thinly veiled creationism as science be very reveal it provide background and encourage the viewer question what be really go on with mary and the idea of the creator divine affect her body and her life the nudity be not exploitative feminist reading of the film would probably be positive since the character of mary be show as intensely self aware and strong rather than victimize or exploit the cinematography of menoud and firmann be excellent throughout this applies to both the nature photography as well as the narrative composed shot think lot of the shot be compose with the idea of replicate some classical painting giotto fra angelico with severe fore shorten the sound track be multiple layered mix of music from bach st matthew passion concerto and dvorak dialog and sound of natural environment and wildlife it a relatively short film 78 minute but it amaze to see and hear how densely compact it be with very complex relationship of sound and image the way this film tackle the concept of divinity as it pertain to modern life be bind to cause controversy amongst conservative follower of organize religion precisely because it force you to question what be take as absolute whether you find it blasphemous or reverent be beside the point that the difference between spoonfed mainstream movie like potc and the engage cinema of godard you will find no moralistic pandering here if you be close mind or easily upset about nudity then this film be not for you if you have an open mind and be just curious to see what one of the true master of cinema be capable of 20 year ago then you should see this interesting film if you be willing to question the story of mary not only from theological perspective but from post modern point of view then it be essential view
four average episode stretch into eight if the flight attendant tfa be to be the premiere original content from the phone company mean hbo max they have long way to go no one could ever blame kaley cuoco for want to shed her bbt image but this limited series be well limit to be fair there be couple of good thing if you want to hear cuoco drop the bomb this be your show and you get to see some of her tattoos hidden on bbt but tfa be also fill with cliche and annoy feature first do every villain have to have british accent and one with sort of scottish accent victor miranda and felix be all serious villain because of their accent of course tfa be not the only show movie to fall back on this tired trope but it seem cliche and lazy in 2020 so if you have british type villain you must have incompetent us law enforcement especially police and fbi at least the white male tfa delivers here too only the grizzled female fbi agent and the unknown gay black cia agent seem to be on the ball these unnecessary stereotype detract from the plot third m sorry but just didn buy cuoco as function alcoholic and how could anyone still earn live be that drunk on daily basis yes there be always certain amount of suspension of disbelief but tfa push the envelope beyond reason what airline would employ such an irresponsible person fourth the pacing of the entire run seem pad like they have 4 ok episode but have to fill 8 show so there be lot of mental flashback many of which seem meaningless also at least from my perspective tfa contain couple of production choice that be particularly annoy this include the overuse of split screen la 1960s as annoying as jj abrams penchant for lens flare and the unison soundtrack by producer greg berlanti favorite composer blake neely neely work on tfa sound more like john william soundtrack for catch me if you can neely have do well work before but it wasn on display here fifth the deus ex machina in episode 8 introduce the unknown character cia which be present almost amateurishly yes he have be peripheral character and go with cassie to alex funeral and hook up with male cater staffer and he conveniently show up at the end to battle the villain and save the girl this be lazy story tell there be some lost opportunity too be tfa really film in rome bangkok and other exotic locale maybe not since we mostly only saw airport and hotel interior there be some street scene which could have be shoot in some area in north america along with some stock footage now if tfa be really shot in those far off locale what miss opportunity for some interesting scene another lose opportunity be the failure to involve more of the male lead family the confrontation scene at the funeral be good and tfa need more of that tension except for the sort of cliffhanger end with the megan character there really be no reason for season 2 of tfa unless it be treat more like true detective where subsequent season introduce new lead character and story line star and producer cuoco successfully shed her penny character which will live for decade in syndication but she need to make good choice for subsequent material

cringeworthy at best plotline spoiler quote ray have always be somewhat of an odd character in my book and here he be again do something quite profound try to spread tired old ideology gay can choose to change their sexual orientation all they need be little bit of good ol jesus the script be tire and the character be one dimensional the film cinematography be not good at all ray doesn mind cut the 5 minute conversation he have with randos into 1000 piece but guess he and his director don mind wait ten second while their protagonist be pat his backpack on chair just sloppy there be some fact strew about this 50 ish minute preach session and lot of them be well blatantly false 10 minute on google would have solve lot of ray problem here but win spoil them for anyone ve always be disappoint with ray and associate medium because it all so simple mind what they don realize be that the christianity they practice have only be around 100 year there be much more to christianity than what be show here and it a shame they don portray more sophisticated version of it we already know the convert or burn but love you story give us something ground in reality do not buy this movie it be not worth 20 must also say that be lot of money to ask for when you re sell not for profit crowdfunded short film almost unheard of for person to pay that much for movie online it not hard to know who or what ray serve one line that sum this movie up be when the protagonist ask colleague what they think of gay marriage they say it all well and good what do you think and the protagonist say think it a bit more complicated than that or translate from love christian to reality some people don deserve right

good actor attemptingto overcome substandard script 1 march 2011 reminiscent of the teen classic ferris bueller day off 1986 in attitude character and voice over this teen comedy add creative credit design with little of cinematic side trip of 500 day of summer 2009 but in this version the audience get to see how ferris might have be create from the lie of an emma stone the script however seem to desperately focus on get its laugh from exaggerated opposite school mascot and other over the top attempt for laugh that seem to break from the more fascinating authentic fantasy as if more make for be well in some way it would have be intrigue if this movie have try for serious teen drama instead in capture the teen audience instead of skirt around the issue use comedy and exaggerate humor almost make light of real bully issue by 12 minute into the movie the one liner be come quick and fast almost at an nauseate unbelievable pace even the public school principal malcolm mcdowell be give dialogue most stuffily unreal and almost like throwback to the 50s the use of the word later be also overdone and the word twit doesn seem to even be problem what be even more scary though be the possibility that the dialogue at least for the student might actually resonant with the audience presumably of roughly the same chronologically the same age may truly think and speak constantly this way in high school it be that long in which case this movie might be more in tune and good than can give it credit for could it be hopefully not an even more challenging and pertinent question be whether the movie industry create the culture of teen dialogue or only reflect it be the dialogue and speech be depict in this movie portray what teens really get into or be it get teen into the depict really bad language and speech pattern boy in the room parent scene continue the overly exaggerated and over the top unreal dialogue that supposedly capture and identifies with the young generation but that really diminish the more serious and believable aspect of this movie focus on some real teen issue take the easy way out of have to develop script that be finely nuanced with both appeal humor and drama shortly afterwards in one of the movie strong scene that start out pretty lame but then brandon plea becomes rather emotionally captivate speech that connect to the real human condition even though the somewhat forced script device of use lie continue to teeter on unbelievability the fakeness of this movie be increase by the obviously impossible swim pool scene in house and teen partiers that could only be achieve in large more urban suburb upperclass venue of movie not the small town depict in this movie the bed room scene be also riddle with clichés and overtly ridiculous phase almost pander to the audience descend almost to raunchy humor more sophisticated sex scene that have nice undertone of humor occurs in the cooler with william macy and maria bello have loud romp towards the middle of the movie the more serious element of the teen condition come into good clarity balance the more ridiculous performance to date as our prima dona become more aware of others than herself the accompany scene though really maintain though with less frantic effort the pace of tolerable humor while only briefly skirt the ridiculous tap into contemporary john hughe wannabee the counselor scene while perhaps intellectually reveal also be very suspect for its portrayal of guidance counselor especially just the immediately proceeding scene its very clear that the counselor be inform of that be really go on just add inconsistency the weakness of the script even when there a great opportunity such as the post counselor scene to really rise above the fluffy pretentious pseudo teen humor the script writer blow it and miss truly bonding relational meaningful moment of opposite contentious bonding in human way past the midway point the real conflict and sexual lie that create real tension finally come out and make for much more revealing valuable and worthwhile meaningful movie experience then with our heroine real date there be severe underdevelopment of her date character to this point so that the inter character dynamic of almost every other similar movie genre be miss unfortunately for the tone of this movie the big dramatic moment be so disrupting to the overall movie background mood that it too radical departure from unreal fantasy to harsh dramatic movie drama while the movie seem to settle down the movie never really get to go to the depth and intensity that the social issue that the movie raise because the movie never really take its subject seriously enough but only use it as vehicle to appear sophisticated and cool what be remarkable about this movie be that it not exactly obvious that the problem with this movie be the actor it remarkable perhaps be that this be movie about script that really doesn do justice to the great actor in the movie because despite the script there be sincere effort to make the best of it and sometimes it show through
you could have it so much good with alan moore for vendetta be well intend film for today audience as many other science fiction movie like matrix or blade runner it present could be world in which freedom be an underrated right and character who be willing to put thing upside down so as every dystopia attempt it make you think it be interest in that the film be absolutely not follow up to neo special effect nightmare in fact there only one sequence that will satisfy the people of that like but regrettably neither the film be well direct nor do the wachowskis write screenplay that raise question in depth the filming language be extremely poor in some sequence like those of the burn birth of at larkhill or the one about the lesbian couple somewhat shallow film though the strength of the comic book remain in the character of besides it always pleasure to see ms portman and hear julie london cry me river

entertain but forgettable this film be comedy about 4 gay youngster make pact to lose their virginity before the summer end it clearly be gay version of american pie with many reference such as the webcam the quiche the parent waltz into the room just to name few the plot be rather mediocre it do not feel original enough to the point where it feel like as if be watch american pie the film try to send message that men should be comfortable about their body but the message do not get across well the film have many gross scene as well such as have extensive fart there be plenty of sex scene and even masturbation scene which qualify it to be porn movie though they be great eye candy feel that there be too much emphasis on sex in this film which may bring the wrong message to young people that sex be everything the end result be that the film be entertain but only on very superficial level it be forgettable film

kid and kid at heart will surely enjoy this force be basically kid movie so it should be judge as such the story be about group of specially trained guinea pig who be able to uncover diabolical plan for world domination by the lead home appliance manufacturer not really plot for an oscar bait film but for kid it work be produce by jerry bruckheimer the requisite slam bang action sequence be also there and since the character animate the possibility for these sequence be limitless and only bound by the imagination of the animator the guinea pig be draw to be very cute and lovable and the audience be effectively draw to root for them personally enjoy the voice talent like penelope cruz voicing of the sassy girl guinea pig juarez her delivery of her line be sure and sexy for guinea pig hehe nicholas cage voice work for speckle the genius mole be topnotch and unrecognizable as him for the human character be surprise at the credit that the force trainer ben be actually zach galifianakis he be definitely the polar opposite here of his character in the hangover where first saw him kid and the kid at heart will enjoy the cartoonish action of force hey it be animate after all although with the excellent cg imagery of the animal character be really so realistic the kid and have great time we do not even remember that we do not watch it in 3d the action be very palpable even in regular 2d format
exploitative unfocused it should have be documentary bit traumatise for moment afterward rather exploitative film it in gimmicky 3d it make the cinematography of the mountain even more impressive but during dramatic moment it seem out of place plus it seem distract just to be wear those silly glass during those scene the immense massive scale and impact of the mountain itself clash with what be the small scale horror the hiker be endure wasn expect some generic action movie but it really seem like those two element work against each other effectively horrify scene of the approach storm itself completely envelop the mountain and unfortunate climber and of hiker almost casually tumble over the mountainside good act all around but also an unfocused narrative an all star cast with no central character almost everyone seem to have only an extended cameo appearance but nothing more part of it enjoy probably couldn watch it second time though
hugely overrate in my opinion be overrate vote 1 one for this movie hop to lower bit the 8 something rating didn pay to see it it be almost free on the internet maybe it not as bad as many of the new movie from hollywood but no way this be top 250 movie all the time be expect in many situation that the story will get more complicated but instead it be another dot on the linear path of the story last 20 minute be completely out of fun or suspense so overall not good story no such act or quote to remember many will say it just comedy don look too hard it a movie for watch at home during week end not demand to understand just fun and relaxing will reply to them hate that kind of movie

much good than the review not your usual stale monster film this movie be quite enjoyable m not sure why it get so many bad review the action be fast paced and the acting pretty good plus it avoid most of the major structural pitfall that plague the monster movie genre there be some flaw which will mention later but first the strong point the monster always die one big structural problem with monster movie be the lack of suspense in the end the monster be always vanquish any suspense revolves around the hero discover the monster fatal weakness just in time to save the heroine in some case as with the 1999 mummy remake the resolution be telegraph so early and so strongly that you grow board wait for brendon frasier to wade through all the special effect laden cliff hanger to finally win the day this remake handle the problem in very creative and unexpected way by first make the monster venerable almost from the start and then secondly by introduce another antagonist who turn out to be equally threaten to the hero this build suspense as the protagonist be threaten from multiple side ultimately all this climax in completely unexpected end that honestly do not see come something really unique for monster film it may in fact be this end that contribute to the negative review since strictly speak it violate the hallowed monster flick formula most people have come to expect damsel in distress another tire issue with monster film be the obligation to service the inevitable damsel in distress theme again mummy 2017 take unique approach by make tom cruise and annabelle wallis effectively co equal protagonist sometimes she save him sometimes he save her often with good deal of humor in the role reversal all in all movie worth see but of course there be some flaw character development be keep to minimum only enough to service the plot line this contrast with the 1999 mummy which excel in wonderfully interesting character who unfortunately be deploy in the service of mundane and predictable plot other flaw include under use of jake johnston as the comic relief and serviceable but uninspiring performance by the heroine wallis have she match the charisma bring by cruise performance it would have add whole new dimension to the movie in general though liked it and be interested to see more of the dark universe

lord of the ring the most overrated movie since the beginning of time lazy review some spoiler let get one thing straight m go to be controversial dare notorious m not go to say that this movie be good shock horror be look over the top 250 movie on imdb and there be lord of the ring the fellowship of the ring sitting in fourth place fourth place how can this movie be the fourth great movie to ever be create how especially when you find masterpiece such as schindler list american beauty and das boot prop up the pile it not surprise there no doubt in my mind that the next two film will also grace the top ten all three of them gleam in line but why be the only person in the entire world who doesn think this be one of the great film of all time best ever sensational it amaze but when be ask what do you think of lord of the ring and have the plain audacity to reply with it alright s pose average be greet with an array of shocked face it like the film no one can criticise and if you do you re clearly insane and deserve to be lock up as for what make of the film itself it start off well character develop nicely interest storyline it be once frodo set off with the ring that thing go downhill this probably originate from the book but why be everything hidden in the mountain of doom in the land of evil behind the tree of terror do everything really have to be that over the top even down to the whole black bad white good ve not read the book also never ever intend to m ignorant clueless no chance of ever get it but when come out of the cinema couldn even tell you the name of half the character let alone anything about their personality you form fellowship and you expect one or two alliance disagreement to occur barely anything in fact be surprised any of them even care when gandalf fell over the edge there be just no depth it be all action action action and no relationship or much development of character even in the terminator you at least know one or two thing about the main character what make great masterpiece of film be have action drama strong character etc as far as can tell the only plus side of this film be the special effect few other point to add firstly half way through the film when they arrive at the elvin village it almost felt like the film be over there be all the closure of we re safe now and not even any cross cut back to the black rider when the fellowship finally set off good hour and half into the film it felt like another film be start gollum the most un scary thing ever oh and the scene where the fellowship be hide and one of the hobbit knock something over be that meant to be quite so funny aragorn and boromir look near identical this be most confusing 3 hour be just too long unless the film be worth it and this one isn i dread to think what sit through the director cut must be like if anyone out there agree with me track down the spoof version of this by french and saunders that be sheer brilliance anyway m off to live in cave until 2010 when the lord of the ring hype should ve die down sufficiently unless it anything like star war in which case ll see you 30 year can help but wonder wonder if this film would ve be successful if not for the huge amount of propaganda and anticipation which just wasn deserve but then again if this film hadn be so successful would have be so critical it be probably worth 7 out of 10 however it paint itself as an off the scale 10 so ll give it 1 instead ha

why spike lee do this really like spike lee with do the right thing but even more jungle fever and think malcom be ok but not extraordinary after that saw few others like and others not so much but never really disappointed until this mess oldboy the korean original be quite complex tale that could only be believable because of certain small detail and really twisted end lee version change many of those detail make the event more far more difficult to accept and force politically correct end on an absolutely sick story even worse be the act josh brolin lack any expression or charisma or anything that can make you root for him sharlto copley be little well but her character be change to clown in fact be little difficult to find it threaten elizabeth olsen be the only exception he give an great sweetness to her character that become quite sensual in his sex scene with brolin it be pity the change from the original leave her character loss on the end the problem here be not the comparison with the original which be masterpiece but that whatever they try to do here be misstep in brief do not lose any time with this couple of good scene do not make movie
terrible script outstanding action scenes the screenplay of this movie be really bad know this be base on true story but have real story to tell seem to turn into an excuse to freely describe the event in non realistic and non interesting way so this story could be very true but for the way it tell it really doesn make any sense one new scene every 2 or 3 minute 1 minute conversation in which the character meet describe the situation and decide what to do unknown character pop up in the middle of the story without explanation there huge lack of elaboration on everything but on the action scene cause the director seem to take those shot seriously and dedicate the time be need to make them outstanding really when the action be there this movie rock this be true story in which action be crucial but occupy probably only between 25 and 30 of the playing time the other 70 be extremely flaw by watch it you can tell the director disregard everything but the action here and the truth be that when there no action this movie doesn make any sense and that something you don fix neither by have true event nor have deniro in the credit you have to take time to describe the event to the audience the excellent action part be not enough to save this one
scale of 1 to ten 3 8 quite shame too well have quite some low expectation from this one but after about 10 minute they raise actually start to enjoy it want more it seem good than average sadly after 40 minute it all roll down the hill deep down probably it when they stop try ok zombex the effect be really cheap mean all the head shot and gun fire cgi weak one too the dialogue be acceptable in the first half quite natural might say the story absolutely nothing new but then again it be zombie movie and some half decent character quite contrast here cause again the first 40 minute pretty much everyone embrace logic and take normal decision after that they all act like they be indeed part of zombie movie dumb dumb and dumb the end didn do much either quite sad quite pointless like journey that start promise and end just because it be time bring nothing new whatsoever therefore rat it 4 almost average zombiefest but not quite there would recommend such thing nope not even the cast can save this one but then again if you be zombie maniac you might enjoy it still almost average zombex cheer

awful awful and awful wow rarely do movie come out that be so terrible that it deserve to be file in the awful category oldboy nail it never saw the original but if it anything like the deplorable and disgust plot of this one then m glad haven see it what ever happen to have at least little integrity and moral standard in our entertainment this movie twist in the end be so reprehensible disgusting and absolutely unnecessary up until the twist would ve give this film 4 5 for its silliness how can one become martial art master by watch cheesy kung fu movie for twenty year my recommendation not even worth the 1 30 at the redbox certainly not worth your time
not that entertain eh there a lot good option to watch for sure it seem like cbs can make new good quality show stop with the revival and reboots and make something original please
an incendiary hilarious and ultimately anticlimactic ride for all the creativity cram into one half hour episode of the simpson be probably not alone in say that the show creative apex bottom out when it stop be funny sitcom and become cultural phenomenon it be year since ve sat in front of the tv on sunday night with the primary interest of be wow by matt groening brainchild when the show first begin in 1989 the bart friendly shirt and pin seem borne out of uncertainty over the show stay power these day with the show position in the tv canon firmly establish your xbox game be design for little more than feed the simpson cash cow that be say revisit the show every once in while via taped weekday afternoon rerun of early season and very much appreciate it the sense of satire be sly incendiary and often very funny some critic cite horror film as be able to express social concern that would be difficult to convey in other genre the simpson would be another arena and easily the more critically acclaim so after year of hype this cultural phenomenon have spawn film aptly title the simpson movie that most fan will no doubt consider belated as laid back viewer with an appreciation of the show the end result be frequently lol hilarious but not very endear honestly have forget most of the gag by the time be out of the theater and walking to my car the best can say be it like really good episode of the tv show rather than great film though guess that complimentary enough will pick up the dvd once it release and be remind all over of why the film succeed in its primary goal of clever laugh it begin with an excellent jab at the film own existence courtesy of homer why pay for something we can watch on tv for free indeed then delve into plot that be as incendiary as anything the yellow ting family have tackle an environmental crisis strike springfield when homer dump silo pig feces in lake that be recently de contaminate inspiring outrage from the citizen and the government head by president schwarzenegger though kept think president mcbain whose epa liaison voice by albert brook who also guest voice the similar hal scorpio year ago cover the contaminated city in huge plexiglas dome before you can say al gore eats yellow snow the simpson escape through literal sinkhole and make track for alaska as renegade from the law only to find themselves return to rescue their idyllic american home which ultimately isn much different than what you would find in an average episode of the simpson this be film that know its audience but also successfully provide an initiation for those who for some strange reason have never see the show the animation be fluid colorful and uber glossy and the writing be on par with the good episodes the mantra remain anything go in simpson world some intriguing character twist aside the film overall neither exceeds nor diminish the expectation of those who expect everything and those who expect nothing it a fun summer film but not an outstanding blockbuster of endear quality you ll laugh heartily and maybe feel move but the relatively short running time be both bless and curse while you will be sufficiently guffaw out by the end credit the simpson movie leave viewer yearn for more suppose that as good an indication as any to go back to the tape
we have grow up indy stay the same sorry but after read all this negative comment like to give you my thought on this when walk out of the movie be not really satisfy because some thing bother me like the monkey rope scene and some other ridiculous and illogical thing but then remember scene from the first three movie like jump out of plane with rubber boat and then bob run with it down the himalaya or indy hang on top of submarine and then swim with it through half of the ocean isn such thing go underwater sometimes well what want to say be that in the old indy film there where ton of ridiculous stunt and it always be very cartoonish and yes often cheesy but as child like those movie for that they be just adventure with lot of action mystic and fun not more we have all grow up with all that logic and reason and we want the movie to fascinate us again like the first three do as we be child the disappointment be program the movie be still an indiana jones movie it have so many run gag and link to the first three one it truly tribute to the fan even that indy start mutt to call junior be nice one maybe this one be too much of an indiana jones movie because it just deliver element that can be find in the first three movie too the car chase insects fall down of waterfall g but what else do we want also didn think the cgi be too much even find it be decent and yes this one be make to make money the first three be also make to make money film be suppose to make money so what so maybe just watch the first three again then relax and just sit back and enjoy this one it not suppose to be drop dead serious and realistic and when look back wasn bore throughout the whole movie it be very entertain it maybe just the long time between this and the last one some thing have change if we like it or not but be thankful that this movie be make the only thing be miss be the whip it have one scene in the beginning and then indi us it never again in this movie always like the whip because it not normal weapon for hero and make indi little more special

great movie have ending this movie have great potential as be one of the great classic movie of all time we be wrap up in it from the beginning to the credit but it do not end m try to figure out why there be sheriff bell character as he didn add anything to the story except one liner don get me wrong tommy lee jones work be simply great as be brolin bardem and all the others believe the character but in the end the sheriff have no affect on the storyline at all and woody harrelson character didn add much his purpose must have be to give chigurh reason to kill stephen root character which make you think so what we already know this guy be nuts the time allot to that kill harrelson and root could have be use to end the movie when the credit start scroll say what it just leave ya hanging after few moment lamely justify it in my mind by speculate that there must be part 2 sequel where sheriff well bring fit end to the movie
not quite as good as have hop this be fairly enjoyable animate film from disney pixar there some funny moment here and there it touch without be too maudlin or sentimental there certainly be fair amount of action as well the story be also good there few scene of minor peril which might be bit too much for young child and the movie fleetingly touch upon sad topic for the most part enjoy the movie do think however there be few scene that be probably intend to be funny but come across flat and pointless in my mind all in all pretty good effort just not as good as hoped or think it would be for me up be 6 10
deceptively good bad film the thing about oblivion be that it come 80 of be decent movie and ruin it in its last 20 now don get me wrong the film be entertain it have almost no boring moment and the action be top notch as usual from tom cruise movie the narrative at least in the beginning be also enough to drive the story and keep the viewer glue to the screen however in the last 20 of the film where they have chance to accelerate the plot and make it into very good film fall back on itself by create more loophole with very lazy dialogue have low expectation of oblivion due to have read the mediocre review online but surprisingly find it good than expect would write off movie like this as just as an entertaining action flick but oblivion take itself so seriously that have to wonder what it could have be if they put little more effort near the end
movie suck big time this movie be for sure inspire by the 1984 george orwell book and zorro but it be neither political thriller nor and action movie it be just waste of time it could be great action movie but they waste too much time be documentary who care people keep talk and talk and talk about bullshit have see thousand of time before they should have concentrate on the action and less on these speech this talkathon would have be great movie be it not so preachy how about the main character where do he get all his shakespearean knowledge they never explain stupid movie always try to throw shakespeare at you think that maybe that will save it why would zoro like figure keep spout these endless diatribe this movie want to be this and that and it end up just suck big time
entertain enough to consider this watchable movie of course this be not great movie but don mind this sort of movie be make the sort of movie with big budget and star cast behind it that be purely be make to entertain for the studio it a good and safe way to make some big cash and for its audience it can be often pleasant view experience typical popcorn flick and yes you can say lot about this movie but it at least be an entertain one to watch just sit back and enjoy perfect movie to kill some time with when you don want to watch anything too heavy but by say all this m not claim that this be great movie on the contrary really it flaw in more than couple of way and most notably with its story the movie be such nonsense and the story be highly unlikely and too often just doesn make any sense it just isn the most clever spy comedy around and it even get quite tiresome after while it definitely movie that feel long than it truly be and it could and also probably should all have end way sooner so no won watch this movie any time soon again but still don regret ever watch it it really be its high budget and star power behind it that make this movie such watchable one its high budget provide the movie with plenty of big action moments the one more realistic and well look than the other but the movie get still mostly drive by its actor tom cruise and cameron diaz play the lead role in this movie and you just can really go wrong with those two have always like tom cruise especially in action movie he can be true action star that on top of thing also can really act unlike most other action star and even though he close to be 50 he still have the right look for the part and can still play it convincingly watch him in this movie you would never guess how old he truly be at the time same can be say for cameron diaz who be also still great look for her age and actually only seem to get pretty never care much about cameron diaz look back in the day when she be the new hot star in hollywood around the time she do the mask and there something about mary but suddenly m now way more able to appreciate her look and m even start to like her better as an actress as well it still kind of odd as to why all these big name both in front and behind the camera decide to sign on to this movie guess that thing look great and promise on paper while the execution of it be bit lacking and also sort of disappointment and can really see this movie work out as way well and also more fun one instead of the movie that it now but at least it also isn the horrible movie lot of other people be claim it to be good movie to kill some time with
a nostalgic masterpiece for others waste of time for some people include myself you tend to be able to relate to lot of the event in mason life as he continue to age the nostalgia that these relation create can bring both good and bad memory up and impact like no other film can have to say lot of the tough situation mason have to endure drunk stepfather can really relate to and could feel the strong intensity in some of those moment however not everyone have these same experience and thus not have that nostalgic effect so basically your enjoyment of the film be really all matter of how much you can relate to it heck at one point in the film mason journey take different turn than what mine do thus end the ability to relate and from there could see why some people hat it but the way look at it to enjoy it be that either way be watch the life of this person and be give the opportunity to see this new perspective when lose the ability to relate with mason on his journey start to almost dislike him for certain thing for some reason when watch this film didn feel like be watch movie felt like be go through life with mason others may not be able to do that but be fortunate enough to experience it like this in conclusion this be really love it or hate it type movie if you can relate to some experience it can be very enjoyable but for others it can seem very boring and pointless can really see both side but definitely enjoy the film and in those final credit nearly tear up because just realize what have experience this be hard to explain but if you understand then you obviously get what m say hope you don waste 165 minute of your life hope you experience this film the same way do if not more so hope what say be helpful thanks for read my review

an overall excellent action pack movie read the review for this movie before watch it and even though most of the review that read say that this be bad movie because it be over the top and have cut out stereotypical character still think it be great action pack movie and be on par with the die hard series or even the expendables to say that this be bad movie because it unrealistic be to say that the action genre as whole be terrible because most action movie be unrealistic but they re still fun to watch for the people that give this movie bad rating you may as well give movie like i joe men and transformer bad rating as well that just my opinion and welcome yours if you re look for good time and enjoy action spend the 1 50 and get this at red box don think you ll be disappoint
not kind of film you should want to watch room br br gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film along with support production crew and cast the story glamorize the process of be hold hostage use young woman and her child be afraid why story teller would choose such topic and why would he be so consumed as to make message of this to the general population although it may seem cute at first see how boy sense the room and world around him be leave with the taste that it only desensitize others this be not story we should expose ourselves to like this as human race we might be tempt to play it down if it happen to others in real life or make it seem to others it be not so bad to commit such an act to others br br there be responsibility here when you interact with the public realize art be base on try to work through what happen to you or what you have experience the art part be you be try to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you be experience but if that be the case here then more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have be movie portray the horror of be hold captive and good yet maybe even realize this be too hard topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume br br give this film rating of zero and suggest this film maker and crew take different occupation to make money don 39 want to be part of any of it anymore and yes there be many movie which could be label as do with this one but someone should write an honest review responsible review
good story but clunky adaptation about midway through this the movie silent hill come to mind not in relation to the story but in the execution silent hill be adapt from an incredibly scary videogame they essentially take all the spooky bit and mash them together on screen keep feel like this look well on paper sure enough in the credit its mention this be base on novel of the same name by daniel kehlmann kevin bacon and amanda seyfried play married couple who along with their daughter take vacation to remote mansion in wale only to find there something wrong and spooky about the house off the bat amanda and kevin have zero chemistry they just aren believable as couple and it doesn help that shes clearly young enough to be his daughter grand daughter even they try to play to it but theres just no warmth between them so it just come off as fake and cringy everything else in the film be equally clunky his interaction with the townfolk be silly and kill the immersion bizarre and pointless casting choice for the villain be so ridiculous some audience will laugh unintentionally the spooky bit be neat but not frighten its all just too goofy its shame because now just want to go read the book and forget watch this pretty disappointing especially consider this be write and direct by the stir of echo guy actually if youre still read this go watch that instead much good film all around
no this be literally the bad movie ever m genuinely mad it be good only because you think it be gon na get good but the whole thing be just bed sheet literally so freaking awful don watch it
there be more than one side to the story will not repeat the other very favorable comment with which agree list for this movie however have one observation that believe make it even more interesting movie kubrick be such genius that he realize that there have to be gray area the soldier may have be guilty of the crime they be accuse of when they do not reattempt to take anthill by at least allow this interpretation it make the movie more than just preachy sermon against war it make movie metaphor for other moral decision
and there be really want to like this and all but where the hell be the killing bird there be bird yes but they didn kill anybody argh there be one zombie shuffle around in this film though kill off teenager in some empty house but don ask me why or where that zombie come from because once again there no explanation for any of the event whatsoever so why on earth be rating this fantastic film actually 3 10 hmmm let me think well the opening scene be pretty solid it set certain dreary mood and those teenager haven arrive yet at that point ehrr it get somewhat of an atmosphere to it this movie somehow uhm what else huh oh yes it italian there you go that 3 point yay
follow into the downward spiral of the manga it base on m not gon na sugarcoat it fairy tail be easily the bad example of its genre shonen that there be and it bad from it terrible execution of fight to overuse of fan service from the nonsensical character motivation to the plot induced stupidity and shark jumping from its clichéd and obnoxious character and its overuse of friendship speech that replace meaningful dialogue fairy tail as whole be just garbage only the great numb skull love this train wreck and even then most don even watch it for anything else but the love affair ship that really aren the focus of the series in the first or last place this movie follow right into the shoe of its source material to start off this movie be promise to take place after the event of the manga servicing as climax to the series in the same manner as the last naruto the movie be to the naruto manga this be quickly dash to piece as it apparently take place after the event of the tartaros arc so already we can tell that we re be lie to by the author himself hiro mashima not that be deceive by him isn already common occurrence after the many time we be suckered into his horrible change the plot itself be also basically rehash of the last movie an evil ruler of newly introduce kingdom steal an ancient artifact of great power that he want to use to take over the world introduce king animus as the prince cream and sonya as the éclair of this movie there be like in the manga no originality in the story or character it really by the number fairy tail production with nothing you haven see before the only difference the budget be much large and the animation be nice what waste of time and money the action be as simplistic and typically fairy tail as well give us the exact same formula of good guy get really beat up but then believe in his friend and 1 shoot the much more powerful enemy that the series be infamous about while we do get to see the highly hype up natsu as semi dragon it doesn excuse the sloppy and boring action that ft have to offer on constant basis the big difference fairy tail have with other series of its genre be the overuse of fan service whereas most shonen have fan service but don let it overstay its welcome fairy tail actively try to make itself appear like soft core hentai or unabashed ecchi from lucy use her weak sex appeal to get her wish contradictory to what her claim that she doesn like do this to erza be unfazed of be naked in front of anyone save for jellal to the pathetic pandering of bathroom sauna scene fairy tail have make name for itself as the most depraved shonen there be dragon cry promotional material and trailer all seem to bash this into our head by show it main character lucy heartfilia in seductive belly dancer clothe clothing she wear throughout large portion of the movie all to keep the viewer invest in see her for exactly what she be tool m not go to act like fan service isn allow in shonen but it have to make sense and be but small distraction from serious or during comedic moment not take up over 30 of the material fairy tail big fan only come to see half or fully naked 2d animated character be put in situation of embarrassment only to salivate over it like deprave horny mongrel fairy tail strong point which the manga lack obviously be the anime musical score music have always be thing fairy tail do surprisingly right give us upbeat and sinister orchestral to soft and soothing score so as much as the movie be dull and boring if you close your eye and just listen then you might catch some good music every now and then when the character aren speak if that doesn do it for you refrain from waste money on this movie and just buy download the ost of it and enjoy what little good it have to offer in conclusion not that it come to anyone surprise this movie be purely waste of time effort and money hiro mashima be state to have write the script and story of this movie and it blatantly show it have everything good and bad especially bad that the bad of shonen have to offer would tell its fan to not waste their time watch it but know that would be as much waste of effort as everything else so to them say this be exactly what you re use to only with nice animation and long run time enjoy your garbage to anyone new to the series or movie go waste your money on something else and to those who massively downvote this review the only reason you re do it be because you re too salty to realize m right go to show how much of hypocritical fanbase ft really have if the fan can not even tolerate other people opinion people even write review like youtube comment to respond to other review they dislike truly pathetic but not unexpected for fairy tail fan
kill the legend of queen grow up with queen and be huge fan this movie be an insult to the entire band irritating and disappointing to watch the story line concentrate on freddy and the directing be really really bad the act wasn anything to write home about either spent 2 hour wait for the movie to hit the mark and it never do such tragedy of what could have be brilliant movie about brilliant band complete waste of time and money
extremely disappointing another girl power movie if you want to watch female empowerment take on horror movie then watch this or if you want pg 13 horror movie disguise as an rated movie watch this everything about this movie be disappoint the only upside to this film be the unique camera angle see throughout the movie mostly the beginning and even then the unique angle have bad visual quality this movie be all about some girl who decide to be hero and stand up to the attacker it be heavy handed and very bad overall this be bad movie that should have be pg 13 no blood or actual terror or anything not horror movie
highly overrate be this movie terrible no but for as much praise as it get m astound the plot be ridiculous and unbelievable that isn what kill the movie however it be the act maybe the director want the actor to act that way but every time they do something amazing they barely act surprise it be as if it be all in day work this be the sole reason why can get myself to re watch this movie the visuals be amaze but m more interested in plot line and character development than pretty effect call me old school even though m in my 20 the movie try to be like 2001 space odyssey but fall short 2 month after watch interstellar not much be retain in my memory have to re read the ridiculous plot and re watch trailer to bring my memory back whereas 2001 watch 6 or so month ago and remember most of it it may seem like m call this movie terrible it not it just highly overrate and need to point out the flaw that keep this from be masterpiece maybe ve see too many program about space cosmos the universe 2001 etc that keep this movie from stun me with the visuals but if you re person that have not see too many space program you probably like it and just an fyi this be come from guy that hat gravity and inception if you like those you may like this movie
you could be excuse for like this if your under 14 have to admit be excite to see this film be expect so much from movie rat 8 5 on imdb after see it be confused how this movie could be rat as highly as others like the matrix for instance which be an incredible and original film this film be nothing like it be tout to be its your basic violent revenge story keep hop for the novelty to show up it never do here be the idea in nutshell you have be wrong and have no power to do anything about it but now thanks to hollywood you be invincible and get your revenge use unlimited power and kill without remorse the smart dialog make me groan the predictable storyline bore me eventually to make the film more interesting start make bet with myself could guess the next cute line be in the same room theater with an actor who have cute remark every few second for two hour straight be mind numbing when film be rat you expect it to be target to adults this have it violent content yes but violence and cuteness only go so far eventually you need an interesting story with that rating come an obligation to elevate the material watch this movie be like watch video game and video game be for child

slow slow slow this be not much of horror at all take about an hour for anything to start happen and when it do there nothing scary about it
seriously come on back to the future isn all that great yes it have its moment courtesy of christopher lloyd slightly crazy doc michael fox wide eyed look of confusion and some superb special effect but the pace falter the humour run dry one too many time and because of all the positive buzz constant recommendation and review state it to be one of the best film and stand high in the imdb top 250 can help but feel disappointed and underwhelmed robert zemeckis be good director countless hit film especially flight which be an incredible movie but people hail this as some of his fine work no seriously this be an average film at best
best in it class and much more this be the best superhero movie ever make if you like to watch superhero movie then you should definitely watch this however must say that this movie be much more than just superhero movie if you don like superhero movie but want to watch good drama action movie then this be one of the best
all through the movie keep say be you kid have always be big fan of the indy movie and be scifi nut also read ebert review to understand his criticism and analysis so that set the stage this movie be unfortunately dreck ca ca poo crud call it what you will it be an insult to the intelligence of each and every movie goer and for lucas spielberg movie to be so be quite beyond belief let me highlight the low and then will get into some specific the dialog seem little more than to act as narration to explain what happen what be currently happen and what will happen in the near future it do not develop the character or the plot the plot be crude and unconvincing the character move through their line with little humor and false emotion although don expect academy award rank here do expect for than plan 9 from out space act if you ve see this you know dreck the chase scene be too long and not always relevant there be no suspense anxiety or real fear display by the actor or felt by the audience there be so many time in the movie that indy should have be kill by the russian since he have do his part but he wasn there be none of the excellent humor that set foundation for the tongue in cheek performance in raider and to lesser extent the follow two sequel the improbability factor in much of the movie be astound and the inclusion of useless scene in also excessive will give detail climb into refrigerator will not protect you from be smash and hurl hundred of yard or more and crash to the ground when it crash at 100 mile per hour you crash as though there be no refrigerator around you since the last time check there be no pad in one of these and let not even discuss the heat and radiation of the blast lead will only protect so much ant can not carry whole people away into their nest nor do they possess tablespoon of goo in their body remember those house size rock revolve at great speed around the spaceship as it take off they would not just stop and drop when the magnetic field be go they would fly off and destroy all around them include all the observer who be just yards away what the hell be the purpose of the motorcycle in the airplane how long do that last when mutt be look for indy he seem not to know what he look like wasn it tremendous coincidence that he happen to first choose the right person and that he be on that side of the train and that the train could be stop for him to get off not explain be that after the initial contact with the fbi they disappear from the movie there be more russian than fbi on american soil after that scene be gunpowder magnetic think not if the cadaver in the warehouse be so magnetic that it would attract the gunpowder why wasn all the metal in the warehouse and be carry by the troop attract similarly why be it that only those metal item the camera be focus on where attract in fact later in the movie this magnetic field could be stop by cloth cover as if an amphibious vehicle of the kind the main character be rid in be not inherently float device like most ship if water get inside or they turn over capsize they will sink like stone clearly there be no sailor on board this cast or crew for all the occupant to survive not one but three fall over fall the last of which look like niagara fall be so comical as to be ridiculous btw know overuse that word why not make them bite small and give the cast some trouble with the cascade so that we be anxious for their safety when thing be so absurd the audience must suspend disbelief so greatly that at no time be it fearful for their survival mutt already have the skull why do he risk death by continue to sword fight what with the attack by the native these occur twice and neither be well explain although the fear factor with them be probably the best in the movie at the end the scene with mac go crazy try to gather the gold and then die be so predictable have be play out hundred of time in other movie couldn they have do something bit different could mutt really swing with the monkey so as to catch up with speeding vehicle just where do he learn this skill while look in mirror and comb his hair when indy blow into the wrong end of the blowgun the native shouldn have die since the wrong end pierce him in fact the wrong end isn sharp at all or it would be impossible to discharge would the army place highly secret and very important warehouse in close proximity to nuclear test site not unless they want to destroy everything in that warehouse which be unlikely and while we be at it wouldn these highly trained russian know that nuclear test be be conduct well have ask more question here than can be explain in lifetime of indy movie and haven ask them all all have to add be want my two hour back please
relentless storytelling review this film recently with specific question in mind at this write this film be rank by imdb viewer as the second best film ever make the second best ever make why this be my question the acting be good robbins and freeman be quality craftsman in the caine and hackman tradition but these be not truly great actor and in any case they be only ask to play appeal person deliberately less dimensional than real as oppose to believably hyper real which be much hard the director be first timer and it show there be simple framing and stag here in fact there seem to be deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible and that be the core of where think people find the appeal of this film the story be very tight in the sense of narrative flow all the chunk be the same size with no fancy rhythm there be no distract backstory no element have irony not write act shoot even the score now for me expect and demand art in my film that why register this as plain but think it be well like because it be totally without pretense it be straight and honest people seem hungry for honesty and this have the appearance of what they need at just the right time be film great because it merely fulfill hope many people think not and dream that this film move down the list to be replace with more intelligent effort 7
a regular action movie where the good guy be thieves movie about cop and robber be classic theme of cinema the organize crime in turn be an undesirable reality this film be excellent when try to portray the methodical way in which these thief act even from pure and unpretentious fiction film which doesn want to be an artwork but merely entertain its audience and give us good action moment pursuits that look like street race shooting almost ruthless bandit resolute policeman and good guy try to help his troubled brother oh and angelina jolie play character who take advantage of her physical attribute the script of b halicki and scott rosenberg have nothing extraordinary except the huge amount of car to steal but the script fall into an error of many theft film by make the thief true hero memphis rain nicolas cage be retire thief who be force to steal to save his brother he acknowledge that be wrong and try to prevent his brother from steal but if we exclude this ideas the rest of the film be like glorification of car theft at this point the script need to have be amend think this film could be more interesting with some more profound psychological conflict surround that and that trouble familiar relationship our society be quite degrade today why not explore the conflict good v evil in another way instead of make the street villains the good guy the film have two very good thing first it have star cast lead by nicolas cage angelina jolie robert duvall giovanni ribisi christopher eccleston among others honorable name cast too good for this kind of movie maybe the film would gain if the director and the writer have be more demand with the actor push them to their best and allow them to explore the full potential of each character but this do not happen for example jolie character simply do not make any honor to her talent its just body second the action scenes some of these be classical but be always well and the visual and sound effect make them even well

very move and well direct be really look forward to see be legend from the moment find out earlier this year in preparation to see the movie watch vincent price in the last man on earth and charlton heston in the omega man even though the main idea of the two prior version be the same last man virus night creature etc the delivery vary for their particular time so be intrigue to see how the storyline would be adapt to our time boy the first thing that strike me be the set be bear and grow up in new york city it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that never sleep the street the abandoned car the bridge the n etc it really hit home then we see much slender leaner will smith try to cope with the fact that he be alone his portrayal of robert neville be oscar worthy very move find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it come as side effect for cure for cancer the prior two movie use plague the last man on earth and germ warfare the omega man to explain the virus the use of cure that transform into virus give it an ironic twist the movie run for about an hour and forty minute but be very fast paced and well direct the creature even though they be cgi be creepy and mixed well into the movie m not sure they could have get the same effect from live actor will refrain from give any more detail to avoid spoil the movie very entertaining
if you ve grow up skip this movie this remind me of many of the 1970s sleazy film with ton of unlikeable character with low moral and be portray by the sick scriptwriter as good people this movie be favorite of of many especially teenage girl who saw real poor role model in jennifer grey france baby houseman grey be extremely irritate to watch to listen to big pain in the butt laugh at some of these review that cite her depth and dimension give me break she a slimeball only likewise immature bimbo would enjoy this movie as bad as grey character be in here patrick swayze johnny castle isn a whole lot well he a guy try to seduce teenager via his dance prowess that all we need to see in that age of child sex molester on the web and who know where else at least she be 17 so guess the filmmaker felt that be old enough from the sex obsess lead to abortion to the father change his mind and give approval to this male scum this script offer nothing redeemable baby have no clue about anything and be one of the dumb character ever see on film be not surprised to read about so many reviewer who think this be cool when they be young and stupid but now that they be lot more mature look at this film again almost in shock at how bad it look to them now good for them at least they ve grow up
if it in your heart then it real li gong be just about the best thing ever to come out of china no matter how many film have see feature her be always impress this be difficult film to watch you be never quite sure who you be watch li gong be in relationship with poet tony leung ka fai and the practical vet honglei sun she travel by train between them but be we watch event in real time or narrate it seem that what we be see be in the past that the poet chen qing have current relationship and only have zhou yu in his heart if this be an american film then believe it would probably be relegate to lifetime but with li gong we have more than romance we have poetry

v for very crappy the excessive dialogue and numerous discussion of what happen in the past what will may happen in the future make this movie move at snails pace even when they do finally cut to flashback forward they be slow down by the voice over the very first scene should be an indicator that the movie be go to move too slowly fill with long alliterate dialogue which be suppose to be comical but just end up be annoy the entire movie try to pound it message into people mind people shouldn fear their government government should fear their people but the message be overdone it feel force fed and doesn have any subtlety to it in the movie they talk about how writer use lie to tell the truth writer also use fiction to bring about philosophy hide it like candy coat this movie be all sophism one big rant without enough story wrap it up into swallowable package don get me wrong the message be good one and really wish the movie could have deliver it in blockbuster fashion but they didn and when message be deliver poorly sometimes it would have be good if it weren deliver at all
annoyingly inaccurate as the film announces at the start it base on true story the essential be true and to get so much history into film thing have to be condense unfortunately unnecessarily inaccurate thing be portray which didn save any time for example turing mutter under his breath so most audience will not notice that the pole make the first crucial breakthrough by the start of the war the pole lead by marian rejewski have be break enigma for over six year and build the first machine call bomba in 1938 in july 1939 the pole pass on all the information to the french and british include detail of the bomba and their success at meeting which include denniston the problem start to mount for the pole and later the british when other rotor could be swap in and the indicator method be change by the german the film be correct in show that turing genius be use know word from the coded message to reduce the myriad of possibility this idea happen in 1939 and so he start from the outset to design the british bombes to use this method not after they have be run for month four senior code breaker not just alan turing but also gordon welchman stuart milner barry and hugh alexander write to churchill in 1941 over denniston head about the shortage of staff and praise edward travis in february 1942 denniston be demote and transfer elsewhere his successor edward travis transform the procedure cairncross play by downton ex chauffeur never appear at bletchley until 1942 and the alleged blackmail be an unnecessary red herring the idea that there would be chart on the wall in hut 8 show the late position of all atlantic convoy be laughable this chart be in secure bunker in liverpool that be as closely guard as bletchley park turing team have no input into how the information be to be use but it be true that ultra intelligence have to be support by other information and so patrol be send out to find what be know to be already there lastly turing would never ever have disclose even the existence of bletchley park to detective he have just meet the performance of benedict comberbatch be exceptional and the rest of the cast good keira knightley be pretty enough to have turn even turing but despite the line that tell us she never give the impression she have double first in mathematics from cambridge good film though it could have be close to reality without make it long or more complex
oh my gosh it trash well rent this for one sole reason just to complain about it well there not much to complain about except it be rather pointless here a short review hope my politically correct term do not offend any one have to put this disclaimer because the internet be full of oversensitive people may contain an obvious spoiler beware from the cover think it would be another mindless lesbian flick just like room in rome my god do that movie suck unlike that film this have character and generic love story and of course it not porn so it be an actual film which surprise me but it still be just meh now notice lesbian be always portray as beautiful woman never you know regular human be judging by how many of these film there be my conclusion be that these film be not make for the sake of film make but instead to satisfy people crave how many movie be about homosexual can even think of one no it always woman maybe because men will want to watch it and there for increase profit sex always sell unfortunately talent rarely do anyway back to the film it just generic love story about forbidden love but then there be happy end blah blah blah the film be pointless never believe the character especially during the first love scene they over acted bit too much like the scene from watchman and the tear run down her face come on what bunch of cheese the whole film be just bland and bore the environment be depress it just so awful know no one will take my advice but stay away
a rather good fantasy movie despite the very low rating this movie have receive here on imdb still decide to give it go why well because it be movie with dragon and do like fantasy movie and dragon as well and also because have be play dungeon dragon for some odd 25 year or so by now so anything that just remotely smell like something in that genre do spark an interest in me be puzzle at why the movie have score such low rating find the movie to be rather good it have good story and yeah it be basically just re make of the moby dick story but so what hollywood have pump out re make of old movie by the dozen these last couple of year so why not also another re make of moby dick one that wasn as bad as the 2010 moby dick movie in age of the dragon you just change the white whale out with white dragon and set the story into fantasy medieval set find it interest enough and also there be very great feeling to the environment as they have really manage to capture the essence of what believe fantasy medieval set with dragon would actually be like of course be lean much on my dungeon dragon experience here the effect in age of the dragon be great the dragon look real and believable as do the wyvern however one thing do jab thorn in my side as an avid role player of the dungeon dragon game be accustom to white dragon breathe intense cold not fire so that be sort of something that didn sit well with me but of course be familiar with the stereotypical mythological approach that all dragon breathe fire so it be alright just would have be cool no pun intend have it be breath of deadly cold instead as for the acting in age of the dragon well though people do good job and they have manage to put together rather good ensemble of actor and actress actually the role of ahab be play by danny glover and think he actually pull this off quite nicely but also vinnie jones play stubb corey sevier play ishmael sofia pernas play rachel larry bagby play flask and kepa kruse play queequeg do great job especially enjoy kepa kruse performance and his somewhat odd character that really bring some flavor to the movie age of the dragon be also movie full of visual treat the town be nice to look at and it really have that unique touch to it make it believable as if you be there in fantasy medieval time but the scenery once the group venture out into the wilderness in search of the great white dragon that be just breathtakingly beautiful do love the scenery of snow and snow clad majestic mountain be little bit puzzle by ahab vessel huge metallic boat like vehicle alright sure great enough idea but just how be the vessel propel what force the wheel to go round there be no sign of any type of engine mechanical or alchemical of any sort and also the vessel look rather small when see outside but inside it seem to easily fit the entire crew and then some so in my opinion there be matter of questionable reason in the dimension of this odd vessel but aside from that then find age of the dragon to be rather interesting and entertaining and if you do like fantasy movie then definitely would recommend this movie despite it be re make of moby dick
just suitable for kid think this movie be not logical in many part and just suitable for little kid the sotryline be very simple but the only good thing about it be that you can find any other movie like this
a one of kind mind blow masterpiece my 3rd time watch this movie yet it still stun my mind keep me enjoy its every moment and leave me with many thought afterward for someone like me who ve rarely sleep without dream it so excite watch how christopher nolan have illustrate every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as it be do so sophisticatedly do believe the rumour that nolan have spend 10 year to finish the script of inception in my opinion it be so far the great achievement in his brilliant writer director career jump into this conclusion after make quick benchmark of nolan remarkable work memento as his first signature in the cinema history be tremendous and have stay the most mind bending film ve ever see but overall it doesn reach the same level of inception the prestige be highly impressive but somehow haven be able to find the very particular nolan spirit in it the batman trilogy be the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight be no doubt masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger take all the spotlight with his life time role the unique and only joker then there come inception where nolan truly stand out have every single detail of his work do in the fine way the multi layer storyline despite its complexity remain consistent and originally interest from visual aspect everything be masterly handle an impeccable cross cutting allow the movie to follow nolan nonlinear story tell without be scatter wonderful cinematography work complete with incredibly imaginative visual effect bring into life so many breathtaking scene some of them believe will stay in the audience mind for long time city bending in paris zero gravity fight in limbo dream collapse in addition nolan have also solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his message later we have interstellar though do admire its cinematography and visual effect the film itself be nowhere near the level of inception spoiler ahead for all who haven watch this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraph contain ton of spoiler it be set in the world where there technology that allow people to literally share dream there be in this world new kind of corporate spy extractor who use this technology to infiltrate the target subconscious and extract valuable information through share dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio very well know extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordon levitt be approach by powerful businessman mr saito ken watanabe for nearly impossible mission something no one have ever do before instead of steal he want them to plant an idea in person subconscious which be also call inception in return saito offer something that cobb could never resist ticket to go home with his child by take out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy veteran identity forger yusuf the only one chemist can make such powerful sedative for such complex 3 level dream within dream and ariadne ellen page newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role be critical for the success of the mission the target be robert fischer cillian murphy son and heir of saito big competitor maurice fischer who die the goal be to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father business and the team have to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischer mind we discover gradually the dark of cobb past as well as the 2 big why concern our hero why he have become such an expert of inception and what be his desperate motivation for take that insane mission the movie be not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of find the way in the maze of life in cobb case it the maze of dream build by his memory with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regret so as long as he let himself consume by the past by blame himself for the death of his love wife it will keep come back and haunt his present the deep the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife come out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layer of its story the end scene make perfect sense yes we re now talk about that famous end which have still remain one of the most controversial movie ending in the cinema history do cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his child in the real world or they be still stick in limbo the infinite dream world and the last scene be just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re find the meaning of his life this end do fulfill its job cobb didn even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn care any more what important to him be that he gon na be with his kid he do finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matter and after all dream or reality the importance be to truly live so from this point of view he have solve the maze of his life some short line about the cast leo have do justice to our main character but he do not success to make leap from his previous similar role in shutter island and blood diamond joseph gordon levitt could have be more intense give the fact that he have the most astounding fight scene in the movie zero gravity sequence there be something miss in ken watanabe performance to portray the powerful man who sponsor the crazy mission maybe it be his english tom hardy be ok but forgettable because his character didn have any memorable moment though he have lot of screen time ellen page be really impressive she do fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally do find lot of charm in her acting cillian murphy have also do great job much more emotionally complex than just target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end be not so different than our hero cobb they both be struggle to find way out of their own maze if for cobb it be the painful past with his late wife for fischer it be the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad last but not least the one who impress me the most be marion mal be so beautiful and mysterious in very unique haunt way mostly with her speak eye and for me she be the most remarkable character of the movie

okay but not great effort from richard linklater 1980 jake be about to start his college education he have baseball scholarship and life in commune that consist of the entire college baseball team college start in three day and we see how he adapt and make new friend write and direct by richard linklater who give us boyhood and the before sunset sunrise midnight series this be ostensibly the college version of what be for me his great film daze and confuse call sequel would be push it bit far as there be no link between the character there be some similarity between the two the dawning of the new phase in young people live new experience and fitting in but quality and feeling wise the two be quite far apart daze and confuse be wonderfully engaging and immediately so and have great sense of nostalgia it be also quite profound in the way it deal with grow up everybody want some on the other hand start off rather dully with linklater try too hard to make the character cool and likable and in the process make them irritate and the plot doesn really go anywhere for while the engagement isn there to start off with and it all seem like animal house or porky without the humour it get well though with the character gain some depth thus become more engaging some interesting plot development towards the end and reasonably profound end it just take patience to get there be ready to give up after less than 30 minute
a nutshell review the legend of zorro finally after 7 year since the last hollywood zorro movie hit the big screen director martin campbell be back with his original cast of antonio banderas in the title role and catherine zeta jones as his wife elena de la vega set 10 year after the last movie the legend of zorro waste no time in plunge the audience thick into trademarked action piece that many associate with the spanish fox the acrobatic lunge flip swordfights whip action and horseback rid it all familiar territory with the romanticize old california now at crossroad where the state be in decision to join the rest of america thing have change for the de la vega family too as they have new addition to the family son name joaquin who take on trait of his father but not know his father secret identity naturally family take the central theme in this movie why do vigilante wear mask simply to protect their loved one as they enroll in the crusade for justice this film explore the dilemma of the avenger as he struggle to be there for the general public in their hour of need and the balance of spending enough quality time with his own family relationship aren rosy with husband and wife and it no surprise they bicker again on screen and when this concealment and protection of identity be compromise what could be exploit from it plenty of action in this movie to keep zorro fan happy and it a marked improvement from the predecessor too zorro move with guile and swift agility that will raise your eyebrow at the style of his acrobat befit his name the fox the use of the whip have increase and so be the intensity of the swordfights however the plot might be bit of letdown it the usual james bondish storyline of some euro knight baddie in some highly secret underground organization try to achieve the total destruction of america one forgot to remind him that he ll need lot more smart accomplice in order to fulfill his desire for world domination with 4 writer credit for the story it do seem convolute somewhat to include too many scene which clock the movie slightly long than 2 hour some comedy be inject but those with tornado seem bit contrived horse that smoke and drink come on the pacing too be somewhat erratic drag some scene unnecessarily and introduce subplots that in my opinion go against the motivation of character there a stab at the high handed tactic of certain government agency and it like watch precursor of spy versus spy game the soundtrack seem to rehash the love them from the early movie too play it each time elenor come on screen and the camera still soft focus her lot too but what could have be give longer screen time be the on screen banter between banderas and zeta jones that be what make the first film likable and popular and while this movie have flash and moment of it we could have have more one could have also expect the effect to be seamless give today technology and nothing new present on screen but while the end result be impressive there be certain frame that be obviously blue screen and superimpose despite its drawback this be still worthy zorro movie and with the signature shot of zorro on tornado hoist its leg high in the sky in an all ready posture ready to strike with sword drawn all can be forgive
hypnoticing and thrilling in way watch this movie without know anything about it until the very end wasn sure about the clue but the total experience be extremely reward there a tension that keep me watch and somehow know something be go to happen admit to not understand everything that happen somehow the movie only release subtle clue until the very end love the cinematography and the music fit the threatening dreamy atmosphere really well not much happens in this movie the more impressive that it keep me at the edge of my seat from start to finish the understated acting of han dagelet impressed me deeply and the end explain it all don expect an action movie if you like mystery and psychological thriller think this movie win disappoint
a sequel that shouldn have be make for start the director of american pie should not have be put in charge of this so far so good franchise meet the parent have just finish with this installment ben stiller be back with his ongoing shenanigan with father in law deniro but all to no avail you will see many godfather reference and jaw reference to name few just terrible and all in all rude obscure and down right awful humour if you see this because your jessica alba fan your forgiven but if you expect to see legend harvey keitel barbara streisand or dustin hoffman on screen for more than about 15 minute forget it leave your brain at the door this stupid movie may get more laugh when vacant
american know entertainment but not pleasure as many viewer remark this movie be about the self discovery of very selfish over privileged and shallow woman name liz at the beginning of the movie liz play by robert kneel down and prays god state with great exaggeration that she be in deep trouble this deep trouble turn out to be very banal divorce which in turn and very quickly develop into yet another relationship liz be woman who be define only by her relationship problem common to the vast majority of female humankind however be an upper class female liz can afford to take year off her life and embark in journey of self discovery perhaps to find out if yet another relationship be what she really but really really need so far not so interesting at all there be at least one good thing about this movie the italian part despite some ridiculous anachronism delivers some truth that americans find hard to accept read some review write by us citizen of course where liz be accuse of the sin of gluttony just because she enjoy some spaghetti and fry carciofi never read any american critic complaining because movie be too violent or too many bullet be fire yet for some reason food be sin and even more so enjoy it maybe that be because as one of the character state american know entertainment but not pleasure and entertainment be business and business in money on the other hand rome be depict as it might have be in the 50 which be ridiculous and even offensive contrary to liz experience most italian house do have hot and cold running water thing turn bore in india also due to the nature of the entertainment but pick up again just slightly in bali the third part of the movie be the best for anybody who be fan of javier bardem he be cute sweet and suitably vulnerable in way he be play the girlfriend part to perfection unfortunately liz turn out even more obnoxious when she shout some idiocy like don need to love you to love myself one really feel like strangle her rather than abandon her to the inevitable happy end would not recommend even if saw much bad
a waste of money when watch the trailer think it be crap but then think maybe should it give it shot love xmen and can wait until may to see it so maybe little bit of mutant be not bad idea on saturday night it turn out really bad if xmen be the real project this be where the interns practice and get their coffee money be shock that marvel franchise this movie there be no story line no twist no surprise no think nothing and the casting be lousy as well character be dull and they try too hard to be funny yes speaking of funny don get why people think this movie be funny my conversation with starbucks worker over the counter have more funny line than this movie or the audience these day don even read that they still laugh at the joke we laugh at in the 90s if you wan na laugh during this movie well joint when the trailer be play
ll free you from what from freedom think any viewer buying ticket for this film be aware of what he expect to see on the screen recently the film industry have be criticize for the abundance of project of purely entertaining nature include the avenger however if you look closely it turn out that there be not so much really good and quality entertainment cinema some film be bore some be bluntly stupid and for the most part it turn out that entertainment can be call only few luxuriously shot scene and at other time the viewer be force to entertain himself with popcorn and cold cola so the avenger be completely different case m not fan of comic book and the attitude towards this genre be rather negative because of its total zashtamovannosti and uncompromising pathos however see such spectacle as the avenger it hard not to leave your sarcasm aside and fully enjoy the propose attraction director joss weedon in the beginning cause me to distrust in spite of the mass of laudatory review his mission serenity do not impress me at all however in this case clear and confident direction be felt throughout the film weedon be also responsible for the script and here want to note how competently it be work out to fill the picture with action to the eye not forget about the meaningfulness and clear drawing of the character character it be balance scenario that make the film look in one go and the character look so charismatic as necessary for positive perception of the picture undoubtedly marvell approach the project very seriously present torah and first avenger last year these film be technically quite successful in themselves at the same time become an effective prelude to the main movie event marvel and the creator do their best to make the film truly an event that surpass its historical predecessor since almost all the character be familiar to the viewer and the story itself be simple and understandable it make it possible to fill the picture with spectacular action to the point that it seem unbelievable how all this can fit into one film even if it last more than two hour at the same time this be not the case when the entire film be throw at different location try to diversify the action in this way the bulk of event take place on the ship nick fury and in new york but everything be do so qualitatively that not how much it tire the scene of the massacre in the city in the final be fascinate although the scene be not call the language because of its wide time frame for very long time the hero will fight the enemy everything will jump fly and explode and all this in an excellent high quality 3d and although the film be not without pathos be pleased that the question of the police who be you to command here captain america do not begin to pronounce his name which the russian viewer perceives with his teeth but simply show in deed of course there be lot of humor in the film however if for example in the same sea battle creator use humor as save thread literally pull the picture from the abyss in certain place in avenger it be albeit an obligatory but an equal part of the overall structure which work in complex this be not the option when you close your eye to some flaw due to some plus an abundance of humor for example because there be no obvious shortcoming in all parameter of the production of the film and the humor itself yes sometimes even stiff and sarcastic chuckling over the hero and reduce the extra degree of pathos in this regard it be not superfluous to mention that joss weedon also have hand in create the scenario huts in the forest but here of course everything be in soft framework to say that avenger be typical entertaining movie would be fundamentally wrong in fact marvel be remove practically by the standard representative of the genre which use every minute of its timing as effectively as possible mass of spectacular action magnificent picture in high quality 3d wonderful soundtrack sarcastic humor and nice character it be this film that should be consider grandiose opening of the summer season of blockbuster as it really set very high level
a lazy effort by steven spielberg steven spielberg with jeff skoll activist participant medium bankroll his project have be on kick for sentimental great progressive moment in history epic with lincoln and bridge of spy however this have to be his least emotionally invest project since the terminal the trailer for this film just scream m make this for the oscar with its main theme of freedom speech from almost 50 year ago make in an era when we once again have president and press embattle and star two count em multiple oscar winner but then speilberg get shut out at the oscar he get best picture nomination nod only because there be ten slot available make it nine and this would likely not have make the cut so watch the film and my bad suspicion be validate tom hank play ben bradlee of the washington post meryl streep play katharine graham owner of the washington post the whole film have to do with the question to print or not to print the information derive from the pentagon paper government document that show that from the 1950s the american government know they could not win in vietnam but continue to send american young men out to die in vain but there be an injunction against the new york time for publish this same information and the case be head to the supreme court in week but the story get muddle between two issue first the screenplay keep get off track with the female empowerment storyof katharine graham woman to the manor bear who never have to work or worry day in her life until her husband die and she be leave the titular head of the post she doesn quite know how to handle the old white male investor who talk down to her or the decision that be now hers to make second what exactly be tom hank do with this role be he try to be ben bradlee or be he try to portray jason robards as ben bradleee with that obviously fake gravelly voice and pot belly instead he seem to be do killer lou grant the post do manage to have some nice tense newsroom scenes some legal decision suspense as everyone be remind just how vindictive richard nixon can be but all of the other stuff mention overrides it oh and be there anything more dramatic than the rolling of an old time newspaper press but just how old time be this film try to go all the president men be set the year after this film be set 1971 yet this washington post newsroom look like something out of 1940 his girl friday with the old royal typewriter dingy wall and poor lighting and you think that the director of lincoln could capture the national confusion and outrage when the public first discover the government have be lie to them but no other than few protester outside of the supreme court zip zilch nada the judd apatow comedy film anchorman do good job of depict public outrage when ron burgundy accidentally profane san diego name oh and the punchline the final scene be nixon rave against the washington post as security guard stumble into the break in at the dnc one year before it actually happen since this be reminiscent of the same scene in forrest gump also star hank be it time for face palm or applause at the anachronistic irony of the situation mildly recommend because hey who doesn love tom hank just too bad that nobody show up to direct the film an editor would have help too
this review be unneeded you have already watch this right nit be really easy to understand the love for this movie ll admit when it come to movie adaptation of book the book be always well how can it not be you get way more detail than could be cram into two hour movie however still thoroughly enjoy this adaptation yes it do deviate from the short little with character change and omission but don think this film could have be any good be in line with the ten star review that m see and the only reason be not give this parable for hope ten myself be because don as rule nhope aspiration fight the system justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society religion this be the film 9
total confusion many people seem to consider this to be brilliant film not me it be confuse barrage of flash back flash forward flash whatevers there be few time when thought be begin to get the drift of what be go on but that not how felt by the end of the film believe that the intention of this film be just to mess with your mind and that be not the sort entertainment that be look for when watch it perhaps at the end of the movie they hop could have empathy with what it must be like to suffer from the memory condition that this guy have so they try to create an environment where my brain be turn itself inside out while try to understand what go on perhaps they succeed but didn like it and don recommend it so bore it annoy me
awful awful this must be one of the bad movie of all time 2 hour of shooting and blast there be lot of action but it be the same through the hole movie people leave the theater before the movie end there be no story it a chase for 2 hour where the main character should be mad max have role as sidekick the movie title should have be furiousa mad max have only few line and after each sentence he growl the movie start of well but after 15 min it be downhill with silly conversation normally good action movie should be entertain and you would leave the theater with smile but not here then in the middle we have lot of fire shooting and blast and lot of stunt animate scene but it do not have any power it just the same over and over again the end have brief rise but again end poorly and foresee the old mad max movie star mel gibson have power and line with humor and bite maybe they be go for new story in this movie but there be none to be find crap
b movie about day the more think about this film and read differ review about it the more feel it wasn meant for me m finn not american don know if spielberg meant this film as last hoorah for the i but to me that be what he make all right the film do have something to tell for everyone in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing have courage to do it that your action have consequence war as whole creates nothing but bad feeling and probably something else too but nothing that have not be tell earlier and suppose that isn so bad mean there have certainly be bad film but what do bother me be that spielberg set out to do film about what war be really like and to me he fail yes have see the opening scene and to me it be more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action even if one would skip all the omission and strange thing about the film in the landing scene no naval artillery support no air force support and the illogical german tactic in the final battlescenes to me the main plot be strange curiosity that only serve to illustrate that the average soldier wasn that interest or important apparently with some link to reality the main plot remain distant and odd to me with oscar block buster critically acclaim material as ww2 with all the gore how could spielberg go wrong first of all the act well could not stop wishing there would have be some less known actor use maybe even amateurs lot have be make out of the cinematography and yes it be good although to me it be not so effective when there be apparently too much money to make film and then the camera work try to make it look more realistic as ww2 film go this film be far cry from come and see yes do admit that flag waving be common problem among ww2 movie just wish that spielberg could have avoid it
ok but it go overboard if be ben affleck and hand this script for the movie d take it as it sound like good plot however d refuse the part to play an autistic person whose get super human power an ace sniper shot excellent heavy machine gun skill and math whiz because that just go over board they ve practically make ben afflek untouchable even bad than jack reacher because at least jack reacher get few hit to the face this accountant have become something like the equaliser just out for revenge that can single handedly take out mafia why have the director not get any realism anymore in their script know this isn a non fiction movie but its becomes unbearable
different be on the basis of my understanding that this be base on the columbine event this be one of those touchy subject would imagine there be some sort of debate on whether or not something like this should be make believe everyone have right to do what they want with art to degree my only issue with the movie it that it could be view for the wrong reason but it also may answer some question for people interested in these kind of situation and the moment lead up to them guess it no differen than an episode of american justice as far as get into the mind of the troubled but for what it worth as film it do it job of portray the moment lead up to something so tragic
distinctly average think that for vendetta be over rat think if it be do by anyone other than the wachowski brother it wouldn have even make it to cinema the storyline be good its an idea that hasn be touch on but the execution be what let it down agent smith play good part in this film as but don think be support by his fellow actor natalie portman should be shot for her english accent as most of the time think she be either from south africa or france wasn keira knightley use for this part she be exactly the same just english the film also hang on way want to get back at the government they could of explain the whole story in one line instead we be subject to lot of bore scene which lead nowhere but to the point we have already hear over and over again think stephen fry play very good part and his act save the film slightly overall give this film 5 10 for the boredom be force to sit through
papillion be much good oh come on 2nd best movie ever don think so it unrealistic and overly sentimental the people who vote so high can have see many film by all mean watch it but papillion for example be far superior who can forget steve mcqueen red rim eye and pasty face as he catch bug and crush centipede into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination wouldn put papillion as the 2nd best film of all time but it have to be the best prison drama watch shawshank and you ll enjoy it as lightweight entertain feel good movie but there be so many classic film good than this 5

not very original or funny this post contain some mild spoiler the long awaited simpson movie have arrive and at first glance it seem to be do really well it have some good review in the medium and it do well on imdb im not particularly sure why though find the simpson movie to be an overly long episode of the late season quality the funny gag be few and far between spider pig just be not funny there wasn nearly enough screen time for some of the fan favourite character skinner moe barney for example but can understand its hard to please everyone in such limited amount of time the overall plot of the story felt no different to what you might see in your average episode and use the same old routine we have grow tire of marge leave homer the town of springfield v simpson nelson laugh be some example the animation be top notch as you would expect and particularly enjoy the music which didn quite feel like your average simpson music but think it match the movie quite well after such long wait and much hype can honestly say be disappoint with the simpson movie perhaps be expect too much though nevertheless would still recommend see this movie it be still entertaining and it do have some stellar laugh out loud moment moe bar scene be hilarious just nowhere near enough for simpson movie 6 10
this quite simply be not inspector gadget once again disney manages to make child movie which totally ignore its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoon be the name the most glaring error be the character penny do not have her book brain have be reduce from character to fancy prop dr claw be more show off than an evil villain etc but there be more than that the horror start from the first minute of the film have gadget as security guard call john brown doesn help identify him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disney blatant attempt to turn every story ever into love affair between man and woman they introduce brenda who only serve to make this movie disney compatible add to this the fact that the claw see in this film and the classic dr claw be almost diagonally opposite and you ll see this be go to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be good storyline to replace it but as you guess disney fail in that too the whole movie be just gadget act silly for silliness sake and lusting after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduce the new gadgetmobile it doesn look function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all it just the canonical comic relief figure disney obviously recognise that the gadget cartoon be comedy so they make the film comedy too but they take out all the clever run gag like the assignment paper explode in the chief face and replace them with gadget be moron the gadgetmobile be wise as and claw show off someone should tell disney that child movie doesn imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be target for child of 10 12 year not child of 10 12 month like this movie whatever this movie be suppose to be it be not repeat not the real inspector gadget because love the old gadget hate this
live up to the title hilariously horrible beyond belief well some like it some don the reason as far as can tell be that it be simply such an incredibly unbelievably horrible movie that it defy expectation or even imagination to the point of be amuse in way if you think you can conceive of how bad this movie be you be mistake you can but there be plus side to that at first be in shock from the incredibly cheesy special effect insanely mind twistingly awful plot and the bad acting have ever see but then realize that be have the time of my life because listen to the dialogue find myself laugh out loud miss some part of the movie just because be laugh so hard at the absurdity that someone actually make this film that nearly wet myself but there be no downside to miss few minute of this flick anyway really think the film must be joke parody of movie and as parody it be very good in summary recommend it
popcorn flick contain john wick dna if you want to indulge in some mindless forgettable action then this movie just for you from the opening scene we be invite into the familiar world of the john wick franchise we see our protagonist living mundane life which have us impatiently anticipate the adversarial force cross his path except we be give nothing but tongue in cheek layer of his past and tasteless action sequence the degree of violence and brutality be satisfyingly ephemeral as there be nothing remotely novel our antagonist be unnaturally reveal use the same russian mobster tropes we ve grow tired of since 2014 film felt too much of carbon copy the setting and place of the action scene be clear rehash of john wick and the equalizer and the film score be shoddy take at tyler bates adrenaline lace tactical music ve already forget about the movie 5 10 be what ll remember
no zombies no high can live with the fact that this isn actually zombie movie the big problem be it barely even horror movie you have to sit through 45 minute of bore teen drama with some of the bad dialogue ever put to film before anything even remotely horrific happen just because virginia madsen be the movie doesn mean it any good
meet okja meat the south korean project which didn even get tenth of it budget at the box office turn out to be one of the most disgusting film ve see for me personally it be unpleasant to see how creator with such zealous obsession be try to promote vegetarianism as almost the only way of worldview for them maybe yes but for million of people subject to religious requirement not to eat the meat of certain animal this be just ban of course many of you can prove and explain to me that all this be show with good intention but see this as just another division head not by religion but simply by food
best action movie ever this movie be the best action movie have ever see or probably will see it get great music make by han zimmer harry gregson williams and nick glennie smith this be the action score in my book great performance good write character development humor and one of the best car chase ever great cinematography great edit great sound the list go on buy the criterion edition dvd of this movie now 10 10
good until it try to become an action movie the movie start out as promise sherlock holmes ish adventure murder suspect clue no one would think of etc but then oh but then about halfway through the movie the movie veers on the course of action temple collapse swordesque fight on ice it just not sherlock holmes sir arthur conan doyle always have more mystique over the crime and it rarely turn into fast paced adrenaline pump adventure the hallucination while interest be also farfetched such as watson hallucination in the graveyard though if you make it through the credit and know about holmes arch enemy you will be pleasantly surprise many holmes saying and trademark appear the game be afoot the hat and pipe and for fan of the book those will also be appreciate it could have be so much good but alas it be not 5 10
fairly satisfying conclusion but there be disappointment and it still doesn make total sense no plot spoiler like most others love the matrix and like lot of others be underwhelmed with reloaded but for revolution come out pretty happy you do see an end and there be some surprise but be still leave with important unanswered question and that kind of inexcusable for the finale in 7 hour trilogy what matrix revolution brings to the table be giant war the machine have reach zion it the last stand for the human and neo must make choice that could bring him face to face with the machine city and possible end to the war after slow but interesting start we see the war begin it a special effect frenzy similar to that of lord of the ring or the arena battle at the end of star war attack of the clone the war scene make up the entire middle third of the film and for what it suppose to display it do it well enough aside from legion of the squiddies or sentinel there be couple new machine that be fascinate to watch giant drilling creature that instill an appropriate feeling of dread and power on the human side there a small army of walk robot similar to the power loader machine in alien but with extensive firepower this result in long sequence of shoot attack and scream which be go to uninspire fan of the matrix deeper plot but which be appropriate for war set the only problem be that lot of this be pretty standard stuff grizzle military commander will be hard on young soldier who find their courage and prove their true worth people will be injure and give important information in speech just before die the hero will be doubt but still do just enough to prove their doubter wrong but then one of the big overall problem be that the main character be sort of lose amongst the backdrop of war morpheus have maybe 30 line become shadow of the informative enigmatic hero he be in the original this time he reduce mainly to someone who hop neo save the world while himself take order as co captain of niobe ship trinity have little else to do either besides tag along with neo or do couple arbitrary flip and kick and then there actually few more specific problem very important scene with neo and trinity occurs within the movie last half hour and although it dramatic it too be cliche what worse after the scene be over the plot just move right along as if it didn matter without it even be mention again give the importance of the scene and the fact that it occur between two character who we ve know for year it feel like it over way too quickly that just letdown the same thing occur with the appearance if the architect the builder of the matrix he have brief scene in this film and have almost nothing important or informative to say whatsoever again it seem like waste especially due to the fact that he should have interesting thing to say by the point at which he appear in the film finally there the film conclusion which win reveal will say that it be one of the less predictable of possible outcome but it too be letdown in couple way first it leave quite few important question unanswered and could be construe as leave the door open for sequel but also could be see as the absolute finish but that the problem if it the end want my question answer want to know the hows and whys the final minute leave me want leave me think that there be several possible conclusion to the story that aren there on film and in my opinion that shouldn happen at the end of something this large and build up to but what really matter be whether enjoy the film although the review doesn sound like do that actually not the case go in plan to know what want to know and while didn learn everything still do spend couple fun hour watch an action movie the act score and effect be pretty much on par with the other film so there nothing lose there but it the detail that hurt where the original matrix be smart script that mostly make sense this one be more or less action with an incomplete plot wrapup but it still do have several good scene and many of the special effect be great loved machine city with its vast field and burn sky also truly love the music for the final fight and during the end credit still while reload have standout chase scene as well as some great kung fu like the 100 smith brawl this one have neither there be climactic and important neo smith battle at the end of revolution but it too be different in demonstrate the epic and dramatic repercussion of this battle it consist mostly of giant albeit very cool effect lot of fly and very little actual close combat this make revolution unfortunately boil down to plot far less interesting and focus than the original matrix as well as far far less kung fu there also much less complicated story development than in reloaded but that probably good thing that doesn leave revolution with much to digest however aside from long war scene and plot wrapup that doesn explain much more than the most immediate question even the actual end after the big fight be pretty brief which then be follow by the closing scene that make thing confuse again in the end revolution be still fun to watch and still like it 2nd of the trilogy it just not as tight and fun as the original and it kind of deflate after the information overload of reload not bad movie at all it just fall little short of the great climax worthy of what the matrix begin year ago not in style or flash but in make everything fit d still recommend it to those who saw the first two just don expect that big revelatory plot scene where everything make sense that still miss

relatively good slasher film find this little slasher film to be good than many of its early 80s counterpart mainly because there be more character development here than be customary for this genre the director show an almost humanistic touch in the dialogue scene and the two basic character be very likable on the other hand hardcore horror fan be likely to be disappoint with this because as straight slasher it a water down virtually goreless piece of filmmaking in any case check it out

no script no movie first of all must say that ve have the pleasure to see the first 3 mad max movie know that this mad max fury road be not mean to be neither prequel nor sequel of the original one so write this review with that in mind summarize my opinion this movie be dreadful so bad that couldn believe it be the same movie that get me so psyched when saw the trailer last year it a non stop of crazy car explosion and cgi support stunt that will definitely please those that like car and action movie but whose plot make no sense at all now could be here tell you about the vision that max have from begin until the end which lack explain or about the fact that they begin journey from to just to find out they must return to but if they have stay there all along the movie would be 7 minute long or even to the fact that they meet bunch of woman that live in the middle of nowhere but surprisingly one of them be wait barenaked on top of an electric pole wait for whoever would ever turn there if it take 5 minute or 200 year instead ll only complaint that apart from the fast driving and explosion fill footage this have no story at all the quest begin with purpose but that purpose be faulty and max character be relutant to join any group but quickly change his mind he rogue but he nice furiosa be powerful woman but be eager to accept that man she know nothing of to join their getaway posse it all so senseless that almost make me cry build some hot rod add some blast create some funky look character and forget any story because we have movie oh and could someone tell me what the be some guy do play drum and guitar that shoots fire in the middle of high speed pursuit mean know it badass but come on
inappropriate for kid in my opinion technology be wonderful thing however maybe we need to spend little more time contemplate the subject matter of our cartoon rather than how cool we can make them look to begin child movie with the revelation that death and heartbreak be inevitable be just plain stupid this movie be depress look at real life that be in my opinion completely inappropriate for child think that give time the movie would accelerate to more upbeat theme no such luck throughout you re remind that this poor old man be alone old and alone be just not entertaining subject even if they re wrap in bright color
great feel good film very beautiful film with strong topic definitely not kids movie but with important topic that should be think provoke for everybody be sure after this film lot of people become vegetarian be close the film really be able to touch the right spot with the audience its beautiful story about the friendship of little girl and her extraordinary animal as well as film about how greedy industrials can rape our nature this mix up be wonderfully do by joon ho bong the acting be good be especially impress by bong lead girl seo hyun ahn who be really capture her character brilliantly and hardly ever saw performer interact with so much feeling with an animated character excellent job jake gyllenhaal be bit too eccentric for my taste but he have one or two funny moment tilda swinton be also fine in her double role but also bit too exaggerate at some point but guess that be just bong style paul dano be really good one of his good performance lately and it be nice to see lily collins the film be good follow up to snowpierecer and very original story with original character and setting

so near and yet so far only russell crowe truly ghastly performance prevents this movie from be genuine classic why must hollywood voluntarily afflict itself with such idiotic casting decision america have more aspiring actor than most other nation have citizen yet she continue to utilize foreign actor in role wholly unsuited to their ability it be the modern equivalent of black face to see the rare dynamism display here by pacino be absorb by the sodden lump of old lard that be crowe embarrass performance be nothing short of tragic my latvian third cousin could have nail the accent good than crowe have this movie be good even great but it not classic and the fault be entirely russell crowe and somebody brain dead idea of novel marketing gimmick

one of my all time favorite movie first off everyone be entitle to their own opinion but most of the low rating be see be criticize the mummy because of it weak plot or someone even say that this movie could have be write by the person dog do anyone realize that there be different movie genre if you go to see the mummy and expect to see the depart the godfather or shawshank redemption then yes of course you will be disappoint this be not drama it an action adventure movie everyone have comment on the fun of this movie that be what this movie be all about personally think the story be very good and interesting there be lot to like here it have element of action adventure comedy fantasy mythology horror and tell pretty well make tale seriously how many movie manage to pull all of these thing off and pull them off well and it manage to do all of this in style with amazing special effect and action sequence no it not perfect what movie be but this movie kill most movie in the same genre have never see movie that can contain so many different element while still be coherent this movie be technical marvel be many aspect rachel weisz be great and look beautiful as well play as evelyn yes she be something like typical damsel in distress but she bring humor intelligence and strong will to the part it hard to integrate so many quality into believable character but she do it well brendan fraser as rick connell after see him in so many goofy movie play an equally goofy character think he be always go to be cast in lame movie such as encino man and monkeybones he be the reason why have doubt would like the movie because could not picture him be more than one dimensional actor able to pull goofy charismatic off only not only do he act the part with stride but he nail every aspect of his character he be cool yet have humor and he really surprise me with how much depth he can add to role that really doesn need it rick connell wields his dual gun with flair and will never doubt fraser again just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this be really impressed with him most because he surpass all expectation everyone else do their part extremely well they always stay in character and add to the element of the story this movie have lot to offer and lot of different way to get your interest especially if the ancient egyptian mythology fascinate you this movie do have element of horror it will most likely scare young kid more than adult but put yourself in the character place you would be quite afraid imhotep be very scary mostly because of all the different ability he possess as well as form he can take could not recommend this movie enough especially if you have hdtv and have the high definition version you will be blow away just don expect character drive drama you re not look for that with this either

good on drama but poor on action this atypical movie would have be good title brother instead of arsenal especially as this film isn an action thriller see this movie in the context of psychological thriller and family drama might allow the audience to avoid the huge disappointment in term of the expectation for lot of action and violence even though there be at time plenty of blood splatter on the screen john cusack play backseat to nicholas cage whose presence be at time display in cagey fashion while cusack have role similar to his more engage one in the action thriller the prince 2014 the pacing be strain as the focus of the movie be on the relational development of two brother grow up and later how their relationship and trust be test the director do commendable job in the depiction of strikingly honest normal behavior of low income dysfunctional americana yet at the same time he struggle in keep the audience engage ironically because of the realism of the normalcy of potentially warped life try watch home video there be sudden twist which be also impression in term of surprise the audience in how humanity be display and the attempt to humanize many of the character but overall the movie seem to lack the fine balance of the interesting rhythm of scene stitch together and the question raise as to how someone so conveniently can find someone who be miss and its inability to capture the intensity of many of the more high profile popular crime film such as john wick 2014 or even take 2008
decent film from the opening moment of quot reservoir dog quot you sense that you be watch different kind of crime drama the style and dialog of this picture bestow level of intelligence upon it 39 character that defy the reality of their choose profession have say that this movie be absolutely rivet in it 39 movement from the ordinary to the grim to the horrific aspect of career criminal quintin tarantino have write tale of an almost corporate order to construct crime gang the delight be in meet these character one by one the particular crime be no more crucial to the film than 7 11 stick up the crux of the movie be the portrayal of the rainbow of character who find themselves involve in life of crime much have be make of the violence in the movie but it only serve to point out that all men be different even the crook the director have include number of very memorable scene this be not linear film the movie work more as series of set piece that weave together story that be not as important as the individual part that you have the pleasure of observe this movie may take more than one view to truly appreciate
very disappointing find it really hard to believe that the writer give their best shot at this the gag be predictable and boring slapstick the story be extremely predictable the only really funny scene have already be kill by watch them 300 time in the trailer which be extremely funny by the way well guess the movie just reflect where the series have go for the last handful of season nowhere there be way to few reference to the most classic scene from the show and so many of the character that make the simpson so funny be also lack the simpson isn just funny when homer be in the picture hurt himself the simpson best humor be the subtle political incorrect satire on the american way of living that be all go now really felt that they have try to hard to make it an all family entertainment movie with no gut political incorrectness surprise or blood itchy and scratchy episode the simpson have lose their nerve

fantasy purport to be serious killer everywhere and the fbi not to be see drug everywhere and the dea only mention in the background and never to be see the local police say to the guy be chase to look after himself and let him go not single policeman to stake out or follow the guy with the money this be after the mass killing at the start of the movie and several more after this gee wiz the police must have more to do than worry about solve crime what rubbish the bad plot aspect of this film be the guy who get the money be portray as smart real outdoors man yet to get lose with the cash he stay in his home town then move to the local city and finally head to the family home and of course oh so obvious his mother in law tell the bad guy where he be go surely smart outdoors hunter would know that the best way to get lose fast would be to go to new york or paris and then disappear could go on for hour about the poor story line and plot fault but you get to see this for yourself to realize it be typical coen brother where reality be forget and fantasy ensues
a great family movie for everyone in the family m give this 9 instead of 10 simply because m sensitive to find footage film with bit of shaky camera however cloverfield it isn i be so pull in by the relationship of the character group of young friend and their struggle to remain close despite construction project threaten to tear them apart with force move yes the theme be similar to t but update for new generation with lovely graphic and think more hip and current take on the idea of acceptance and friendship this be one of those rare film that both adult and child can take something from and the whole family will enjoy together real treat for me to take my 8 year old to
all bark no bite if you like strong and logical plot you be likely to dislike this one it all about appearance and show in this one rather than actually be brilliant the character and story just ask you take their brilliance for grant the story revolve around illusionist implicitly portray as demigod would say and how they manage to fool everyone and get little fooled themselves of course with all this fool around there be always chance that something might strike the funny bone that be to say it have its humorous moment now and then but on the whole the illusion and trick etc be just more of dazzle than something logical and realistic there be not much depth to the character and lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective but the misdirection only add to the illogical nature of the plot and make the story hollow have criticize enough the good part for me be the cocky as usual jesse eisenberg and some of the funny moment but nothing else even the dazzle of the magic trick be make slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogue final word skip it unless you don have good choice for movie in mind
masterpiece of visuals but only visuals the lord of the ring the fellowship of the ring be an epic ambitious film in scope and magnitude if not in heart it tell the fantastic story of frodo hobbit small person from the shire in middle earth the shire be peaceful place as close to utopia as one might find his peace be interrupt when the sorcerer gandalf rid into town and discover the secret to bilbo ring bilbo also hobbit acquire the ring from gollum distort creature whose life have be elongate but also deform by the mystical ring when bilbo leave for adventure it be frodo job to return the ring to the desolate mount doom and cast it into the fire from which it be make this you see be the only way to destroy the ring as mere hobbit frodo can not shoulder this burden alone along for the journey be his gardener and confidant samwise sam for short two other hobbit merry and pippin too immature for their own good meet up with frodo and sam on their way to the magical land of elf once there fellowship be form to destroy the ring one of them be aragorn ranger with secretive past he be the primary focus of lord other than frodo and the ring he be descendant of the man who hold the ring over mount doom and could not destroy it he be in love with the elf arwen but the backdrop of the time leave that love affair in jeopardy sauron the dark lord who originally create the ring have find out its location and seek out the hobbit and later the fellowship to take the ring back saruman the secondary villain in the film be sauron puppet but also want the ring for his own power he be sorcerer like gandalf but have turn to evil also in the fellowship protect the ring from sauron and saruman be another man boromir he be from the land of gondor legolas be the lone elf representative in the fellowship elf be the fair of the many creature of middle earth and gift archer there be also dwarf slightly tall than hobbit and certainly more robust name gimli dwarf reside in mine great connection of cave in the mountain through which the fellowship must journey in order to complete their task it be difficult to summarize the plot of lord of the ring because of the amount of information that be throw at you there be character and their ancestor different creature in the elf dwarf hobbit and men in addition to them there be the mysterious orcs goblin ringwraiths uruks sorcerer and the creature all onto itself gollum this complexity in setup and the numerous strand of plot to keep under control be the primary problem with the lord of the ring it take me up to three viewing to saturate all of this material and half way understand it the triumph of peter jackson labor of love be that you want to watch it indefinitely to soak in all of this splendor the effect and setting be indescribable other than to say nothing this stunning have ever be feature on film before visually the picture have no equal and will forever be understood as alter the way movie be see unfortunately to tell the story backdrop much of the humanity involve in middle earth be leave on the back burner in addition to that there be serious problem with pace the filmmaker seem more interested in remain faithful to r tolkien original creation than they be in attempt to make workable adaptation into film in that regard there be large battle sequence that feel very much like the climax of the film but be then follow with upwards of an hour of more footage this be the straw that lead fellowship from be great film into good film with that in mind be force to think of fellowship as split it be masterpiece of visual technology and presentation but marry to story that need more heart and less intrusion of detail out of
wow that be terrible just get home from spend good money and time to watch this stinker truly don understand any rating above 6 can handle no plot but no character development or learning along the way or some revelation or commentary about life other than the moronic one at the end please don waste my hope for something good also as man who work his tail off to support his family and allow his wife to stay home to raise kid that say thank you as oppose to the knucklehead in the movie find it appal that every significant man in the movie other than the photography teacher be an arrogant pontificating loser and half of them be abusive drink what be the point of this want to throw up every moment ethan hawke be on screen his meaning of life speech be pathetic and can understand the reason for put it in the movie other than to re enforce what self aggrandize ass men be why go through all the trouble to make this movie and sucker people in to watch big so what if you go to movie to be inspire emotionally move or present with another viewpoint to ponder you probably win like this movie sorry just don get this movie rat it 6 because it be not terrible just really mediocre include the acting to bad the director be stick with actor who get bad over year not well
visual gem without much substance can imagine that back in the 80s this be mindblowingly good and the visuals hold up very well to this day but story and character wise for movie that relatively slow pace there be hardly any character development logical decision or motivation aside for revenge survival and be force back on duty for most of the runtime character make such rash decissions it almost laughable all this sadly make decently build up universe pretty bore the act wasn bad though m give this 5 just for visuals and the fact that this probably have inspire quite bit of good sci fi today
overrate what an overlong overrated load of blasphemous rubbish
sloppy write save by good action and one of my most favorite emotional ending re watch winter soldier in 2020 after the completion of the main story in avenger endgame simultaneously make this movie well and worse some thing become clear but some of the stuff that the character say and some of their action make less sense if you have see endgame and captain marvel for example there be couple of throwaway line from nick fury about how trusting people make him lose his eye but captain marvel film doesn really support this some of the stuff feel well like the elevator scene if you know how cool it will be handle in endgame also black widow look in this film 10 year old than she do in infinity war and endgame and m not sure why the film be keep float above the water by creative and cool action good cgi that hold up even 6 year later good humor great pacing that make 2hr movie feel like 15 min short and of course the emotional end scene and while the writing be kinda sloppy and barely hold it together many thing didn make whole lot of sense even by comic book standard the friendship between rogers and bucky and the end performance get me every time it so simple yet so effective just make me wish have real friend
overlong overblown and over rat come on guy accord to the imdb top 250 this be the second best film ever good than citizen kane well than godfather part ii good than almost everything no it a very very long very very predictable very very cliched very very old fashion and sentimental film bless by some good performer especially james whitmore who alas do not figure prominently enough it worry me that many of the comment here seem to think the film artistically transcend the usual hollywood fare when in actual fact it wallow in all the convention of its genre give it 6 10 mainly because like tim robbins and morgan freeman the only people who could mistake this for great film would be those who mistake the work of stephen king for great literature 4
5mins in bore within the first few minute why aren there any great new christmas movie these be horrible don want to sit through the rest of this to see how it ll turn out also the knight character be not even dreamy heath ledger wannabe but complete fail
analysis for pulp fiction 1994 actually like this film little more than some other rat film include do the right thing there be more good scene that could watch than other rat film however like do the right thing this doesn touch my heart one bad thing about this film be that there be bit of violence that really don want to see in term of the other part of this film they be okay like the fight scene but they also have some drawback in my opinion the bad thing about this film be once again some partial nudity have never like see some movie that include nudity start with the graduate but not everything be bad there be some good part in this film include great acting nice cinematography and very good lighting effect the rest of the stuff in the film be like hit and miss for me overall this be good film but it doesn offer as much comparing to the other film that review

one of the more enjoyable war film ve see sometimes struggle with film set around the cold war simply because don find it as interest compare to the like of ww2 and vietnam the courier though be nice surprise it be reasonably complicate story tell in nice easy fashion to follow the story be well set out and it be well pace too consider there aren a lot of action sequence possibly none now that think about it benedict cumberbatch be great in the lead role he such likeable guy and there something fascinate about him he very easy to root for love how overtly british he be in this movie the whole cast be great though it have to be say the only thing didn like be scene near the end where character be bring in to speak to another character it set up triumphant scene for the heroic character so know why it have to be there but the scene simply didn make any sense in the context of what the russian be try to achieve otherwise though have great time with the courier and would recommend people give it shot
dull and anti climactic m little rankle by the over the top praise for this minor masterpice theatre dud m not come from historian or speech therapist point of view just an avid moviegoer one letdown for me be well pretty big one after all that speech therapy the king didn seem to be that much good off at the end of the film he never really have pervasive porky pig stutter more like an off and on stammer and fear of public speaking at least that how it be portray in the film it seem liked firth forget to deliver his line with the impediment or else in real life it be not that serious the scene that deliver the rating have firth be instruct to shout 4 letter obscenity as some kind of remedial these strike me as gratuitous and inauthentic this be not great film all thing consider
mediocre comedy its harmless clichéd ridden comedy its identical to hollywood film in pace plot and structure its well execute and may be entertain for someone who doesn have sophisticate taste for movie the fact that one of the main character be quadriplegic doesn affect the basic plot by any measurable degree its traditional story of rich guy meet poor guy and the two become friends the rich guy like classical music the poor guy like pop music the rich guy like art the poor guy prostitute etc the cliché go on and on only someone who have watch few movie will be impress by this story its extremely conventional the joke can be funny sometimes specially the one where the character exploit the fact that he be quadriplegic since one can not find these joke in other comedy but overall the film be okay but not good and be not worthy of be view in theater
the long overdue simpson movie be hilarious and witty piece of entertainment the simpson movie be witty fast pace touch hugely entertaining and most importantly laugh out loud funny and if your simpson fan who love every episode thats all you ll need from it however if like me your an obsessive fan who notice drop in quality on the show from the late ninety onwards you ll see some problem you ll see that structure wise the movie be basically an extended episode you ll notice that the villain be hank scorpio rip off you ll feel that lot of the plot point and character drama seem all too familiar but in spite of all this in spite of be film base on show that exhaust its best gag long ago the simpson movie be still absolutely hilarious and take my hat off to the creator for manage to make it so simpson movie in the early ninety when the show be in its prime would have be well but the very very very funny one we have here in 07 work just fine funny stuff
like as kid but lack of tacstorm now very noticeable be on cross country plane ride recently and notice that back to the future be one of the movie available as one of the in flight entertainment option d see it as child in theater and maybe one other time since so thought d see if it hold up grant m not kid anymore but wonder if there might at least be some nostalgia value sadly no the problem be that since the last time saw back to the future d get myself tacstorm couldn help but fixate on the place where continuously fire gun would ve change everything for example when the libyan track down doc brown in the parking lot all he have be revolver that doesn even work imagine if he have an automatic handgun that be already fire on its own before the libyan even arrive and all he have to do be aim realize he have to get kill for there to be movie but still couldn get over the absence of the tacstorm unfortunately the movie be pretty much taint 20 minute in and only get worse in the climatic scene where george mcfly knock out biff with one punch all could think be how he could ve easily miss or not hit him hard enough to knock him out just imagine what would have happen to him then but if he have gun that be always fire there be no doubt just guarantee security when he need it most realize the movie be make before the tacstorm be create but that doesn make it any more watchable in the year 2019 as it turn out that not the only movie that doesn age well because it doesn have tacstorm for example my girlfriend and watch the goony recently she have actually never see it she think it be pretty good but say you didn notice something miss mean really huge omission she didn at first but once explain that data wouldn have even need spring load box glove in his jacket or oil jet in his sneaker to fend off the fratelli family if he have gun that be always pump out bullet it be so obvious to her and sadly even some of my all time favorite movie have lose their luster because the tacstorm be so glaringly absent in the godfather for instance when michael have to kill sollozzo and mccluskey in that restaurant clemenza tell him not to take any chance well sorry but if he doesn have tacstorm if his firearm isn discharge continuously straight from the factory he take some major chance plus if he have tacstorm it still be fire when he drop it which would take out anyone that try to follow him so now don know if even want to see any new movie at all guess the good news be that maybe they re new enough to have the tacstorm in them but do want to waste money to find out you think with four guy in the band at least one of the member of queen would have one but didn see one in the bohemian rhapsody trailer not to mention the trailer for aquaman or rom well if m not 100 sure m just go to watch some tacstorm demo videos online at least know they win let me down

zoom zoom zoom feel like ve be stumble on movie like this lot lately film with an excellent message concept that suffer from someone just insist on over the top artistry in the case of zoom we get movie with some very important commentary on body image the perception we have of ourselves the way our appearance impact how others see us and how we see ourselves and our very potential the problem be this get so far up inside of itself that it lose all focus what could have be simple and poignant film have to be twist in multilayered contrive mess of plot that weirdly part who frame roger rabbit this isn an awful watch it just lack in focus and restraint trim some of the nonessential flourish and this turn into pretty poignant movie that think have terribly important message to get across sadly we get what we get and that not rouse success exactly it an interesting watch and think it worth check out for fan of the cast or those who be really catch by the trailer description but if none of that grab you can say this be must watch

take rat violent book and dumbed it down to p13 to make more money simply many over the age of 18 read these book and love them and it wasn because there be girl boy and another boy in love story it be about an awful political system where child face to the death for their survival with awful paragraph of cruel brutality this be part of what make the book unique the movie be an attempt to draw crowd like twilight for money and completely blur out child kill each other to survive so that it could be make pg13 ridiculous jennifer lawerence be an awesome actress though and she do great job throughout the movie be never convince that she live in district 12 nearly starve or that peeta be die in the hunger game it be all very pretty and not anything like imagine they would do with it oh well maybe they ll remake rat version some day that adequately portray the book theme

visually beautiful story wise not on par the natural landscape and some of the scene be overwhelm and spectacular the camera work be so immersive you believe be part of hugh glass journey through the wilderness and back to civilization also with great performance not only by dicaprio but also hardy as the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leave glass behind story wise it be bit thin for 156 min picture glass quest for vengeance be sometimes lose as he utter few word about his drive and be be more or less chase himself the story arc of the indian quest for their daughter felt bit out of place and strange we also get to see the fur trapper o that leave glass behind and the captain way ahead of them which in my opinion take little bit of the magic of glass total perilous journey all my star go to the beauty production value and performance alone regardless this be one of those overlong movie one like but would not sit out for another viewing
well at least the ewoks be cute another fairly boring and massively overhyped sequel the quality of act be very poor and the narrative take on an almost soap opera feel at time the special effect be generally pretty average as well and have certainly have go backwards since the original overall just don find the star war triology to be particularly interesting story it litter with flat character terribly execute battle scene and extremely corny dialogue plus the stormtroopers must be the most pathetic villain in the history of cinema do they land single shot in any of these movie do enjoy harrison ford and carrie fisher performance and love the droids but the rest of it just look and feel quite cheap for kid grow up in the 70s and 80s fully get why this series would be so magical but in reality there be far good story from that era simply do not understand how this particular trilogy become so iconic

a piece of art but not good movie to watch first of all can understand why so many people in the industry like the film it appeal to the life of actor producer director and people in the film and theater industry maybe the movie be do by the textbook perfect cinematography and what not but really don think it deserve an oscar just for that it start out with very vintage style the music the constant percussion sound and the focus on the backstage environment make it feel more like in the day of the life of type of documentary it look cheap while watch and it take real effort to try and follow the cliché have be washout predictable story of man in his post midlife blue just because some famous old actor play the lead role and very good might add do not mean it be captivate movie it uninspiring and it leave one with feeling of regret regret for the poor sod who make the wrong choice regret for his daughter who struggle struggle with drug addiction regret that he do not care little more about other people in fact m even regretful just for watch this movie people who will appreciate this movie be aspire actor producer director cameramen woman or people who like watch drama theater warn to the average movie watcher this be not blockbuster it be not typical enjoyable movie it a piece of art not mona lisa but picasso abstract and ugly but with underlying mean movie like this be popular because of the artsy follow it have not because it appeal to everyone be not interested in act or anything to do with that industry just want good movie with convince action that take my mind off of everyday life for while this be definitely not it
faster yeah you ll wish it be over faster this be not an action movie this be crime drama thriller in the trailer for it it look like an action movie but it be not probably the reason why didn like it like the rock but he be not really he type of actor you put in thriller drama he be more suited for action or action comedy it not that he can act he not bad but still he fit well in more action orient environment this movie be not all that entertain really it be kind of boring at time you just want some more action you want the rock to be the super bad as that can throw guy around and beat everyone up here he be suppose to be more of normal guy not exactly normal but he be not suppose to be much of bad as and let face it he look like wrestler bodybuilder he look nothing like an average man faster be just little boring can think of much more to say
this film be not that bad enjoyment can be have when watch this film its often very funny possibly when it isn suppose to be funny but who care where the humour stem from at least its there if this film have be do more as pastiche than serious superhero film it may have survive little well shot like an extra long music video the film do have some decent directorial idea but they just don come through pitof put some great angle in and often have some flair for imagination but to often the film chop and change set piece and move at such pace that you have no time to take in the fact that the film be actually quite pretty the script and storyline be just terrible whoever be responsible should never write ever again killer face cream enough say sharon stone and halle berry do well with the little characterisation they re give have this be showdown between michelle pfeiffers catwoman and sharon stone katherine tramell can help think this film may have be hit its real shame that this film just didn go correctly it be my belief that catwoman be great superhero villain and think if do correctly it could be great but until then sit back relax and take in this catwomans absurdity it not good however it be watchable halle berry razzie win do seem little extreme though her acceptance speech be brilliant
effective if unspectacular courtroom drama primal fear be decent and moderately absorb courtroom drama film the plot be certainly more intelligent and methodical than the average mystery drama or at least it would have be if it wasn for an unconvincing and rather predictable twist towards the end the big twist doesn add much to the film as whole and the plot just isn absorb enough for the twist to have the desire shock effect have say that the film do lot of thing well and be effective as courtroom drama it owe much of its success to some very good acting and script the character be all well develop and convince with richard gere and edward norton deliver the stand out performance primal fear would have be lot good if it have focus more on these strength rather than go down the same path as so many other murder mystery film
a tragic waste base on the 1980s graphic novel by alan moore for vendetta have tremendous potential fabulous source book top notch actor and brilliant director and then they blow it the graphic novel which be more libertarian than liberal be very even mind not truly side with either point of view it contrast two extreme anarchism and fascism and let the reader decide which be preferable most importantly it be most definitely about england not america this be their first mistake they change the plot to appeal to modern audience but what they end up do be inject us politics into british story not nearly as even mind either the film completely side with the title character who have go from libertarian anarchist to liberal revolutionary worse still the plot line back story be now thinly veiled analogy of the 9 11 attack though the eye of conspiracy theorist tragic waste consider the film good point the acting be phenomenal especially hugo weaving have to do the entire film mask deprive him of the benefit of facial expression the special effect be impressive too reminiscent of the wachowski brother work in the matrix unfortunately all this be lose in the poor storyline which reduce this potentially operatic masterpiece to sloppy political satire
a deep and personal marvel this be my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all time favorite list eternal touch certain part of you your heart that most show never do or rather could never do it show the fragility of relationship people want to erase bad memory of failed relationship yet at the same time cant bear to part with the good one how so can that be do how can you erase bad memory and save good one only carrey and winslet do perfect job act as joel and clementine respectively arguably one of their career best so far its pleasant surprise to see the man behind the mask playing such quiet and introvert role kate on the other hand bring clementine to new height as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate eternal be definite marvel feat in itself its rich and flamboyant yet fragile it bring the audience to such personal level it hurt especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure well do
i think it be great after read some of the other review for this movie be begin to wonder if be read about the same movie have just see with my grandson can not believe how many reviewer do not like force my husband and think it be great and it keep our 4 year old grandson totally entertain the entire time and this be despite technical difficulty at the theater that cause the movie to start almost an hour late it be the first actual 3d movie we have see though we have see other example of 3d at amusement park etc and we very impressed my husband and be literally laugh out loud at our grandson duck when thing would appear to fly out the screen right at him and have no idea how they accomplish make the fly seem to come from the back of the theater towards the screen the fly seem to buzz right by my ear would definitely recommend this movie
unexpected twist that rob off the audience must admit that have enjoy watch the movie until the point towards the end when out of blue we get twist and turn point that no one expect or be prepare for this be when we realise that between the point when mia go to paris and her return to hollywood and happy life with another man but sebastian something very important must have happen but what remain in the dark in fact it become one big gaping hole which for me be put off to my mind this kind of gap that lead to twist can not be do at the very end in supposedly romantic movie where the audience invest their feeling into the main protagonist this kind of end would compare to zero roi and even loss if we be to invest financially in any course we believe in emotional investment of the audience be also an investment basically rat this film low only because of that regard it as an emotional rip off
entertain and bit more adult than the show have see the long lived tv show only few time year since it begin but ve always find it amuse if not worth tune in for be also not big fan of comedy so needless to say my expectation be not very high when go to see this with some friend tonight the film surpass my expectation as the show usually do the characterization be consistent with the series and the addams family of the 90s be just as lovably screw up as they have always be the central problem this time be that partly due to homer behavior the level of pollution in springfield be so high that the epa quarantine the entire town lynch mob go after the family but they escape to alaska to start new life the plot set up be also cleverly connect to religious superstition and mass paranoia this take us about half an hour or maybe little far into the film there be plenty of relatively smart joke compare to the average will ferrell flick with some satirical political overtone and bit of risqué humor as well recommend the simpson movie to fan of the show and friend of fan while don really think the film be entirely appropriate for young kid it should be fine for most of the family teen plus
justified title this will be very disappointing to the huge fan base of srk include me plot be quite poor with unrealistic build as the movie progress it ll get you into more disbelief tho it start with huge entrainment the fun ride doesn last till the end as we see from the past movie srk second half of the movie just let the whole movie down same with this movie totally it just dissatisfaction lead after be expect from the anand and srk combo be not go well
the bad film from the studio ghibli if this movie wasn produce by the prestigious studio ghibli there be no way disney import this mediocre at best film even suspect that disney be force to buy this film as part of package attach to other great miyazaki film the film be unwatchable unless you be six year old would understand if it be target at small kid but it be target at young and adult generation the first ten minute of the film have some freshness but then all character and action sequence in the cat world be just horrible dvd contain short documentary that explain the reason why the studio produce this film as miyazaki and takahata be get old they be desperately look for next generation but if they continue to produce this level of quality movie the studio be doom
i ask myself question when watch this movie would it make me love the simpson more or would it ruin the show altogether have to say the answer to my own question be the former love the simpson when be 10 12 but just over year ago for some reason stop watch it maybe didn find it as funny and creative anymore anyway the simpson movie be constantly hilarious and witty movie that completely exceed my expectation yep it be very silly but it be lot of fun as well so much so have decide to give the show another chance the animation be true to the style of that of the show with crisp colourful background and excellent character animation the music by han zimmer be wonderful while the master have do well work the music be still pretty darn good the theme tune be still as irresistibly catchy as it be when the show first start the story be good one there be ton of hilarious moment and one or two heart warm one too grandpa revelation in the church at the beginning be hilarious and like it when lisa find special boyfriend in the name of colin do worry that the environmentalist message would be too heavy hand but it be handle just right the voice cast do an exceptional job bring the iconic character to life especially dan castallenetta as homer and they be aid by some delicious dialogue have no real complaint of this movie though if the film be five minute longer we could ve learn more about epa overall think the simpson movie be absolutely terrific 9 10 bethany cox
great in the first half less so in the second in the near future the planet earth be disintegrate environmentally team of astronaut explore out space to check if there be another planet where earth remain inhabitant can be transport in order to survive the first half of the film be fascinate it have great idea about what the future might be like consider the current level of greed and over population there be also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of family be separate matthew mcconaughey show brilliance and depth in scene where he quietly show how much he miss his loved one play his school age daughter mackenzie foy be no slouch either the second half be interest at best muddle too busy and overlong at bad there be also major character whose fate be leave unknown to the point of almost be trivialize the movie be good in many way but have the potential to be more
predator predator 1987 mctiernan be definitely no 10 10 masterpiece the predator itself be fabulous can fault it but the film be no more than tongue in cheek sci fi action farce it isn genius it actually mind numbingly silly as bunch of muscle mound each cliche be hunt down in the jungle it the top gun 1986 scott of sci fi action film however subversive it might be with the inclusion of murderous alien that outstay its welcome towards the end fun act heel thump soundtrack great monster and an influential idea make it must watch but it ain a flawless classic

funny truthful and very much the best of breed 80 high school picture teenager start become aware of sex relationship and the need to earn extra cash in this slice of life high school tale film that will probably not be do any justice by me or any good reviewer for the simple reason that so much of what go on have be do so many time since but still believe this be the best schoolyard melodrama around and it still make me laugh with its home truth and clever one line you want romance we can even get cable tv sean penn be standout as the stoned surfer who sadly live nowhere near the sea don believe any teacher would take time to go around anyone house as here to continue the lesson but it be funny scene what be present here be take as model for other film that try to boost up the sex comedy or drama but this film be lesson in balance and step lightly that others miss nothing be too big deal not even abortion fast time be lot of fun when saw it twenty year ago and be still fun today true many of the actor go on to do even well work so it be great to see them when they still have their own front teeth and even bit of puppy fat this be especially true of the great jennifer jason leigh one of the best american actress of her generation not great here simply very good
pretty but bore as start see the commercial for this movie be convince that this would be typical fairy tale movie not worthy of be see until today be definitely not go but as circumstance go wound up at the theater at 2pm almost late but in time for the start the movie start nice black stuff all over and bad guy who look like they need lot of facial hair to cover their ugliness be all over the place the middle be interesting lot of run and other stuff comparable to run scenery be outstanding the end be uh go where do the end go someone quickly think of another hour for the end the end leave thing pretty unfinished since the good guy neither die nor win think another 3 long hour for the finish would be add as sequel or something at the end would say that the only thing good about this be the scenery and the cast nothing else be worth spend 8 and sit in chair for 3 hour the plot seem full long 3 hour long the story seem involve but not to me overall heard lot of people say why do come here or saw people leave good hour before the thing be officially over ve heard lot of people who ve already read the book say it good and at the same time lot of people that haven say it awful if you really need to find out if it good or not you should go see it but if you trust me rent it month later for lot less

a dazzling joyous piece of film making of all the animation classic from the walt disney company there be perhaps none that be more celebrated than the lion king its acclaim be understandable this be quite simply glorious work of art the lion king get off to fantastic start the film open number the circle of life be outstanding the song last for about four minute but from the first sound the audience be floor not even national geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic not only be this easily the great moment in film animation this be one of the great sequence in film history the story that follow be not as majestic but the film have to tell story actually the rest of the film hold up quite well the story take place in africa where the lion rule their king mufasa james earl jones have just be bless with son simba jonathan taylor thomas who go in front of his uncle scar jeremy iron as next in line for the throne scar be furious and set in motion plan to usurp the throne for himself after tragedy occurs and mufasa be kill scar persuades simba to flee leave himself as king simba grow up in exile but he learn that while he can run away from his past he can never escape it when view the film it be obvious that the lion king be quite different from its predecessor and successor this be an epic story that contain more dramatic power than all the other disney film combine while there be definitely some light hearted moment there be no deny the dark drama that take up the bulk of the story while it could be argue that disney be the champion of family entertainment this film be not for the very young some of the sequence be very dark and violent many border on frighten even for the old crowd the voice actor be terrific jonathan taylor thomas bring large dose of innocence to young simba he mischievous but also terribly naive his old counterpart voice by matthew broderick equal him he old but no less mature the voice be so similar that it almost impossible not to believe that they be the same character at different age perhaps no one could have be well suit for the role of mufasa than james earl jones his baritone voice give the mufasa quality of great power and wisdom there be no question that his role be king as scar jeremy iron be pitch perfect the drawing of the character be villainous but iron vocal work complement the animation to create one of the most memorable and vicious villain in disney history he unquestionably evil but he also clever which make him all the more dangerous manipulation not violence be his great weapon provide some much need comic relief be nathan lane and ernie sabella as timon and pumbaa two other outcast meerkat and warthog and rowan atkinson as zazu while there be definite fun from these character neither the actor nor the filmmaker allow them to go over the top and destroy the mood of the film disney animate feature be know for their gorgeous artwork nowhere be this more apparent than in the lion king every single frame be jaw drop the color be rich and the drawing be sharp and beautiful one of the pitfall of animation both computer and hand drawn be that there be sometimes visible distance between the subject and the background make it seem as if the figure animation be cut and paste on the background this be obviously what happen but it be up to the artist to make sure that it isn noticeable there be none of that here throughout the golden age of disney animation the film have be musical the lion king be no different and the song be brilliant all of the number be standouts can you feel the love tonight win the oscar but in my opinion the circle of life be well in the case of simba and nala simba girlfriend both young and old there be noticeable difference between the speaking and singing part everyone else do their own singing and speaking but never mind it still work and that what important the lion king be not flawless but on first view they aren noticeable and it be likely that the young win ever notice them beauty and the beast be the first animated film to get an oscar nomination for best picture it lose to the silence of the lamb and be thus far the only animate film to receive such an honor that be the case it hard to understand why the lion king be not give the same distinction the two film be more or less equal in quality and the nominee for the honor that year be not strong if you haven already see the lion king you win be disappoint
the intro be great the rest not so the introductory credit sequence for the movie watchman be amaze it could be that like it because like comic book as well as the story with alternate history the rest be interest but only for comic book aficionados the others might have have problem in stay awake the reason for initial excitement and later disappointment lay in the story itself back in the day when watchem appear the story have be rather interesting but so many year later it be just one of many comic book bring to screen and one of many alternate history present to the broad audience this combination be still potent yet the complicate plot demand slow pace which in turn have be simply too slow
what the hell from read other review it be now obvious this film be base on book my point would be that you shouldn have to read that book first to then understand the movie how on earth people can give this 10 10 be joke as it do not make sense and bad of all it never try to make sense the only save grace be good performance from scarlett johansson even though she only have 20 line throughout the film she command great screen presence which make the 90 minute bearable if could go back in time would chop my hand off so couldn load up the dvd player
terrible movie in many way think be go to see the movie of the year must have be bad year aside from the factual inaccuracy of the portrayal of quadriplegic woman the stereotypical white trash family the cartoonish boxing and the ridiculous danger character it be ok in the end the movie prove to be cheap political statement and send terrible message in the process be paralyze from the shoulder down at age 18 m not on ventilator as swank character be but be totally dependent on others for feed dress etc this movie just perpetuate the myth that sustain such an injury lead to meaningless life swank can choose between school and death and she choose death thank you for set the disabled community back few more year what have do differently ve go to college live on my own and work as respected journalist in the community where be the story about someone like me why do every disabled person in movie have to be punchline in joke or depress and angry for the record my feeling about the message don have any bearing on my feeling about the quality of the film it just wasn that great my opinion be the only reason it receive such acclaim be clint eastwood and it deal with controversial subject we know hollywood love to wax on political issue if you watch this movie please realize that the depiction of swank as quadriplegic be poorly research hit me up if you want to know what it be really like

worth watch for edward norton primal fear be fine film it structure well its script have the occasional neat twist and it have an amazing performance with edward norton in fact d say his performance be so good it be worth watch the film just to see it besides his performance there wasn too much remarkable about the film for the most part it be very by the number style courtroom drama that be coat with somewhat cliche love story about two ex lover richard gere and laura linney both deliver good performance but they never really blow me away either the overall story have an interesting hook but wish several aspect of it be take far specifically wish more be do after learn about the corruptness of the church and its leader that be an interesting twist and wish the film far explore the thin line between victim and assailant regard edward norton and the murdered priest character overall fine film on technical level the film be fine the cinematography much like the rest of the film function well enough to keep interest but be not spectacular primal fear be worth watch for norton but it be not something ll be return to
film that capture moment in time this be beautifully filmed piece of cinema in which the real star be time and place the plot such as it be be rather thin and draw out whilst characterisation be sketchy and insubstantial there be sense that such sketchiness be deliberate and justified in order to capture those distance which exist between childhood and the adult world between one class and another and of course the sex alan bat farmer ted burgess be give no depth beyond that of horny rustic whilst julie christie as marian wear her dress well without once betray any real hint of what she feel beneath her corset this emotionless quality which hang over the drama as heavily as the norfolk heat in which it take place be nowhere as perfectly capture as in the smoking room scene in which hugh edward fox and the head of the household mr maudsley michael gough communicate over the head of leo wonderfully play by dominic court with look and pause and word whose deep mean the young boy can only come to understand when he be old and able to look back on the event of that summer as an adult no review of this film would be complete without mention of margaret leighton command performance as the powerful class obsess matriarch mr maudsley who ultimately be force to cut through the know acceptance of the male and bring the relationship between marian and ted to an end at the same time unwittingly bring leo face to face with the disturb truth of what go on between men and woman in the world of adult
thirteen year on still one of the great fantasy film ever make sixty year ago the hobbit bilbo baggins come into possession of magic ring when he decide to leave his home in the shire and retire he find it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind disturb the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that bilbo trinket be actually the one ring of legend which the dark lord sauron need to complete his return to power bilbo cousin frodo have to take the ring on long and arduous journey across middle earth to the volcano know as mount doom deep within sauron land of mordor the only place where it can be destroy back in 1999 when peter jackson begin film the lord of the ring there be an expectation of failure thousand page long book adapt into three three hour movie by director whose big previous movie have be minor ghost comedy star michael fox and on budget of only 90 million apiece at time when 200 million budget for such epic film be become more commonplace it seem like recipe for disaster against the odds jackson pull it off the trilogy as whole be remarkable work translate tolkien vision onto the screen with for the most part respect and integrity there be misstep mistake and some ill conceive change but these be mostly restrict to the second and third film in the sequence the fellowship of the ring on the other hand be move from page to screen with enviable skill the main key to the film success be the cast elijah wood may be lot young than frodo in the novel but he sell frodo mix of book learn wisdom with lack of practical experience with wide eye enthusiasm represent the old guard veteran actor ian mckellen ian holm and christopher lee bring their role of gandalf bilbo and saruman to life with presence and gravitas the actor be pretty much all excellent even cate blanchett as she struggle with curiously write interpretation of galadriel marton csokas be probably the film weak act link as celeborn but give he have about twenty second of screen time this be not major issue must also admit to not be altogether convince by viggo mortensen as aragorn the king but as strider the ranger in this first film he be superb in term of scripting and change from the book some key sequence be miss tom bombadil be go which be wise move as be the barrow wight which be more regrettable and other element be compress the journey from the shire to bree which cover dozen of page in the book happen instantly on screen or eliminate altogether fatty bolger the fifth hobbit be exorcise from event other event that happen in the book off page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order such as saruman confrontation with gandalf at isengard for the most past these change be well judge even if some fan favourite moment be leave out for three hour movie the pacing be generally excellent with good mix of exposition character building moment and action set piece the movie effect be impressive with cgi be hold back and use only when absolutely necessary with miniature often employ to give physical location sense of presence and weight whilst clearly result from budgetary restriction this prevent the film get bury under fake look cgi and mean it still have more convincing effect than the recent first hobbit movie which feel little silly it difficult to pick stand out moment from the film the black rider pursue the hobbit be an evocative moment as be the confrontation on weathertop and the flooding at the ford of bruinen the outstanding sequence be probably the descent through moria which feature both excellent character moment such as gandalf conversation with frodo when they discover that gollum be pursue them humour pippin encounter with skeleton on well action the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of mazarbul and tragic horror gandalf last stand on the bridge of khazad dumb the whole sequence be joy to watch the film missteps little near the end the trip to lorien where the fellowship regroups after moria make sense in the book but in the film it dangerously come close to kill the pace of the movie altogether this be not help by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of galadriel jackson be to be commend for try to make the longueur work but ultimately it feel like it delay the film climax too much at the moment it should be ramp up towards it fortunately in the cinematic edition it a fairly brief sequence event culminate in the epic battle on amon hen with sean bean deliver stand out performance during boromir last stand and sean astin sam get his first notable moment in the film cliffhanger end the movie success be further by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by howard shore which must rank as one of the fine movie soundtrack of all time the lord of the ring the fellowship of the ring remain thirteen year on one the fine fantasy movie ever make the writing acting and effect work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special something that peter jackson have struggle to replicate ever since
much ado about nothing hype personify this film be little more than routine cowboy film set in space good versus evil at the most banal and simplistic level imaginable the performance be bland and uninspiring throughout in short it present day hollywood do what hollywood do best hype not worthy of inclusion in top 1 million
even my 8 year old be bore zoom be dreck grant it a kid flick but the classic kid flick endure because of quality there be no quality of any sort in this junk of course when you go to movie these day and see revolution studio before the credit you know you re go to end up with brain numbing rot the big mistake sony picture ever make be fund revolution the best move sony picture ever make be close the revolution door so to speak oh and you know you re in real trouble when this appear in the opening credit song by smashmouth tim allen courtney cox chevy chase and poor rip tear ugh what in the world be they think know the first three aren a lister but see genuine talent like torn waste in slop such as this be depress forty shade of blue one minute zoom the next oh well it pay the bill suppose and my how chase have fall every now and then spark of his former talented self glimmer through but mostly he stick do embarrass schtick one scene where his character be stick in an outdoor simulator be just awful he mug and dance around like second rate rip taylor without the feminine traits obviously
overrate this film be overrate it can possibly be the best film ever there be much good film than that however it be still good film 8
it a gimmick but who care the story change track every 5 minute and be torture to watch can appreciate if short term continuity be not an issue to come up with novel plot that you want to cram into one movie as much as possible the whole movie would turn into something like this but honestly you have to ask yourself be the character in this movie worth that much attention to me they weren there re nothing likable about any of the character that spur me to find out the truth about their situation so overall it become like who care after about the first 20 minute and no don want to see this movie three or four time just to understand what go on so the movie be just novelty and doubt that it will be remember as any kind of ground break masterpiece even if the rating be high how many people can honestly say that they go to see this movie four or five time at theater bet none if pay 10 expect to be entertain in the first viewing not show some self indulgence of the screen writer that have to sift through the mess to understand what go on you work for us not the other way around please take it back and you can keep it

stodgy and slipshod spielbergian historical tribute much to my surprise find spielberg account of the washington post constitutional battle with the nixon administration over the post audacious and impulsive decision to publish the leaked pentagon paper in 1971 to be mildly prosaic and detach it definitely lack the raw drama it be obviously angle for and key scene come across as tentative and sloppy despite an impactful committed performance by meryl streep as katharine graham the publisher of the washington post who help crush gender barrier in journalism and lively turn by tom hank as the brash and swagger ben bradlee editor of the post this film suffers from lack of depth and surprisingly scattershot approach to the story by spielberg viewer would be forgive for come away with flawed understanding of the pentagon paper because the film be more about how the washington post come into national prominence by defy the white house in publish document the government claim as top secret and vital to s military success in vietnam some might argue that this film should be watch and evaluate more deliberately but when spielberg himself rush through the material and the filmmaking process it hard to claim that the viewer have miss something with this much proven talent on both side of the camera haste make waste not recommend
force to watch my sister make me watch this she insist it be contagion disease she be compel to spread after see it truly understand relate and recommend it awful but transcendent awfulness you want to pass it around like milk that might be spoil but everyone need to test it anyway ve never laugh so much at something that isn even try to be remotely comedic it a travesty m not surprise there be drink game build around it but you ll be more than amused watch it sober yes it that bad but fun you want to see it over and over again and force other people to watch it too rent it on particularly bad day you ll forget everything irritate in your life and be weirdly involve in world of badly clad midget suddenly wonder if baloney sandwich or urine could possibly be the solution if you vote give it one it truly deserve the recognition of be one of the bad movie ever
like racy woman in peril flick from lifetime this film be surprisingly not horrible product of the mid 1990s rebecca de mornay boomlet it take the woman in peril formula and jigger with it just enough to come up with something worth watching and not just for de mornay bosom sarah taylor rebecca de mornay be psychologist who start receive threaten letter and package like someone be stalk her but be her stalker tony ramirez antonio banderas the puerto rican charmer she just fall in love with s it cliff raddison dennis miller her upstairs neighbor who have one night stand with sarah long ago and seem desperate for another encounter be it max chelski harry dean stanton the serial killer she analyze in prison for his upcoming trial could it be her father henry len cariou who just re enter her life and with whom sarah have an obviously disturb relationship or do her stalker have something to do with the fiancée who abandon sarah almost year ago the story keep you wonder until reveal the truth which turn out to be pretty decent for twist end clock in at under 90 minute never talk to stranger be like well make wad pool there no depth to it but it work as it intend to there some sex some mystery little humor from dennis miller and just touch of violence there not lot of chemistry between de mornay and antonio banderas however they re both very pretty and the movie move quickly enough that it never ask you to take their relationship too seriously de mornay banderas and the rest of the cast do reasonably good act job and the film be adequately write and direct despite the ambition of the twist end there not lot here that will stick with you for less than 90 minute though it a pleasant diversion the only thing that separate never talk to stranger from the typical woman in peril movie you see on the lifetime channel be few word banderas bare butt and de mornay naked breast so if you re look for good racy version of that sort of thing you ll find it here the only truly interesting thing about this film be the fact that de mornay be one of the producer demonstrate again the principle of producer self nudity and that it a product of the aforementioned de mornay boomlet it one of the more intriguing hollywood phenomenon where an actress who may have have some success as starlet but never become star suddenly experience career resurgence in her 30s these woman usually get one attention grab role and it like the movie industry notice them again and decide to see if they can squeeze any more juice out of them sometimes these boomlets reinvigorate career like they do with sharon stone sometimes it just peters out like it do with de mornay but whatever the reason for them the 30something boomlet be probably the one thing that keep lot of actress plug away in movie long after they should have find other employment m pretty sure the beautiful and talented winona ryder be wonder when her boomlet be go to come along
a classic hero return just come back from pre screening of the fourth indiana jones movie and say enjoy it immensely wow for year now think that after war of the world spielberg have lose his touch not so here here he return to the basic fundamental of the lost art of practicality and just plain good old fashion genuine storytelling something that solely lack in today cgi heavy world help along by the big guy himself harrison ford along with witty and charm shia labeouf as newcomer to the franchise with george lucas lend some support to cinematography ford be simply amazing as the venerable adventurer with lot of impressive stunt work everything be big and good than before the action be of high caliber the plot be thorough and excite with intelligent write couple with awesome special effect but what really surprise me be that it look like it be film in the 1980 something that rare in this digital age m sure those accustom to digital film making may be put off but it actually work really well and give the film an add dose of nostalgia and sense of wonder that spielberg bring so successfully in his past film not many film can achieve that feat but can strongly say that spielberg have go out on top and bring back one of the most beloved cinematic hero around for one more time m enthusiastically await sequel with open arm

the film be another example of number if big budget movie about holocust and jewish people in world war ii be massacre by hiltler army the story and form of the film be move and engage the audience in to dramatic core of the film what have observe more as specific talent and skill of the director be mood and tone of the film be transform to the audience heartbreaking sequence of the film where jew be move toward the gas chamber and moment later where the smoke come out be utter shock and depression which we as audience feel it also the camera shot choice and composition make the sequence identical the hand hold camera in some sequence have achieve the aim of the filmmaker to engage the audience into story shift between objective to subjective point of view for instance where the jewish woman be run into the chamber and the door be lock on them apart from the suspense of be burn in the chamber which we see be not the case and they have shower the audience feel the tension and terror in the scene
why change the real story so much why why not tell the story as it be why change the timeline and many of the event
another fine film by pixar this be the first feature film that have see in 3d before discuss the merit of 3d let discuss the film pixar must be the most critically commercially successful production company of recent time they have no dud in their back catalogue and number of classic movie up be another fine film and just fails to make classic status although be sure many people will rank it alongside wall and toy story personally find it little bit too sweet although that a fine line that most of the pixar movie tread the film follow the dream and ambition of couple of kid look for adventure carl and ellie we see quick clip of them age and put off that trip they always plan to south america before we know it it too late or be it the great thing about the movie be that you care about the character it always seem bit strange to me that for some reason it be easy to feel empathy for animated character than real actor ve put it down to good script writer in the past but m start to wonder if there something else go on anyway m sure most people will love up and that it will be many people favourite film of the year as mention earlier this be the first film that have see in 3d can say it really add to my enjoyment of the film and can help feeling that it a bit of gimmick design to increase cinema taking ve be to several 3d presentation at theme park but think that where the technology belong maybe there will be killer app that really showcases the technology but don believe 3d will add much to most film
excellent flick would see again ve get to say go into the theater expect to be disappoint but must say the movie catch me totally off guard the fact that there be nt that many line but yet you always know what be go on be quite impressive and enjoyable would nt consider it sequel to daredevil but more of movie of it own though there be few reference to daredevil nothing substantial nor have the plot have anything to do with daredevil as for the action be definitely surprised it wasn fake look at all really do enjoy it the effect be do great as well d definitely recommend see this one give it try and never trust what critic say d give it solid 8 5 10
it a fun movie this movie isn what expect there be lot of talk about this movie and lot of hype brought from it during its release year it a great kid film and it even hold lot of comedy for adult have lot of fun and enjoyed lot of the great comedy throughout this movie even though it fill with lot of sadness it have cliché montage in the first ten minute to show lot of time passing and allow for the main character of carl to be old russel be quite show steal character with his comedic relief and the dog dug who be hyper active upbeat talk dog help give some comedy too it really unlimited in term of comedy it get tad bit of romance and it fill with tragedy for more than one character it a fun movie full of heart thoroughly enjoy it and m sad didn take look at it in 2009 when it come out but m glad finally saw it it one of the best pixar have ever have to offer
should have be call bad mood bad act ok ok that pun be pretty lame admit but no bad than some of the attempt at humor in this film which be actually not to say that this film be completely terrible it isn not by long shot but it just isn that good either actually enjoy amos kollek earlier film fiona quite bit and would still be very interesting in see his film sue but this be really nothing like that gritty slice of life documentary style film this be more of quirky almost sitcom ish comedy to kollek credit this predate the whole quirky indie trend by few year so it doesn quite have the same pre meditate feel as say me and you and everyone we know however it have lot of the same problem as that film do none of the character seem at all real and everything they do or say feel completely script to be witty or quirky and be only sporadically funny although at least it be little the whole film give off decidedly no budget feel with very primitive camera work and often amateurish act despite the presence of louise lasser which in and of itself isn bad since at least it doesn have the studio gloss of most recent similarly mind pseudo indie film if anything give the film little more credit than it probably deserve just for have such run and gun no budget feel do like the choppy rough edit for purely aesthetic reason also it deserve some credit for not have too much of plot except towards the end and good unhurried pace
the big dud just have the unfortunate experience of watch the big lebowski for the first time all can say be that m amaze at its popularity it hard to comprehend people actually like this overrate dud and claim it funny and entertaining as if the muddle and overload script and plot weren enough the character aren the least bit interesting to watch jeff bridge character be an unemployed loser and for that reason alone we re suppose to think he really cool bet slacker misfit must be the only one who could identify with such character moreover john goodman character be downright obnoxious julianne moore steve buscemi and john turturro be waste in nonsensical role plus the laugh be few and far between the cliff scene when john goodman scatter steve buscemi ash but the wind blow them on to jeff bridge face be probably the funny bit in the whole movie everything else seem force the music be forgettable and if you want good display of roger deakins cinematography suggest you see good coen brother film brother where art thou to think this film come from the same people who bring us fargo and blood simple
nothing special read the book this isn the bad movie ever but don buy the hype about message movie the message be heavy hand and poorly execute note be not say disagree with it or it be propaganda it just isn very good natalie portman and hugo weaving be wonderful mean would watch p eat breakfast and be happy but certain aspect of their interaction be gut wrenchingly cliché and silly the plot stress simplicity and often the audience be inform of thing rather than show them just to make sure no one get lose on the straight as an arrow plot unfortunately simplicity do not prevent plot hole and this movie be rife with inconsistency omission pointless twist huge subplot with no resolution and perhaps the most cliché romantic dialogue imaginable it isn horrible it isn the day after tomorrow or troy prime example of terrible blockbuster but it be standard hollywood fare and any message present be do far more compellingly elsewhere no matter what your politics it borrow lot of it ideologies from bowl for columbine go see the movie if you want some so so escapist far but you could get something good off the netflix queue without try too hard brazil spring to mind if you want to see the story do right read the book
up to date disturbing and powerful despite few dated element do you want to be disturb be you ready for clammy ice cold classic that relentlessly sad chilling and upsetting try sunset boulevard where else can you find movie that start actually start with the main character be drag out of swim pool dead and then the poor dope spend two hour tell you how he lose his job his career his girl friend his self respect and his life but he get that swim pool he always want it horrible to watch joe gillis lose everything william holden give his character so much smart and charm you just can believe he can be snuff out so easily but that what hollywood do and the message be that if it can happen to joe it can happen to anyone on the other hand norma desmond be truly fiend out of hell gloria swanson will never be equal in her courage play woman who be more repulsive and hateful than any modern serial killer or hatchet wielding maniac and yet all she want be to go on be young and beautiful forever share the magic of her stardom with those wonderful people out there in the dark and the message be if this monster be what in front of the camera who know how many other monster be out there in the dark at the heart of this movie be an intriguing contradiction on the one hand the chilling madness of norma desmond be as real and modern as the ghastly antic of the late michael jackson funeral for chimpanzee anyone on the other hand the anguish of joe gillis at be keep by an old woman be almost and do mean almost too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involve in the story consider how this story would play if the gender role be reverse what if norma desmond be tough male western star of the silents someone like legendary stuntman cowpoke tom mix and what if the young screenwriter be pretty young woman with cheerful irreverent upbeat personality sort of like carole lombard or katherine hepburn if the two of them get together it would seem sweet romantic not repulsive and chill particularly if the eager young female help him to get over the death of beloved wife or maybe his horse the point be no one would be horrify if 50 something male star seduce bright young woman in her late twenty or thirty in fact it would be regard as rather romantic by lot of people lot of the horror of sunset boulevard come from an unthinking assumption that woman with money and power be unnatural creature and that they can only attract young men through evil and manipulation and there also the double standard that woman over 50 be no damned good to man but man over 50 be still in his prime one final thought william holden have wonderful career well into his seventy and deservedly so one of his last great performance be in the wild bunch where he play an age outlaw name pike bishop note that pike have the same basic concern as norma desmond have outlive my era can still command respect what be my life worth yet pike struggle to pull off one last job be not only not laugh at they re render as poignant admirable and unbelievably heroic pike play the kind of noble courageous life give elder whose wisdom and humanity and even his violent tragic death simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community that the kind of part mature actress should be able to play as well
excellent most distressing part of be fan of the sci fi genre be that on the one hand we have an embarrassment of rich in continuous flow of excellent literary work from which to choose and on the other hand sputter supply of embarrassingly bad movie and lackluster tv add insult to injury the fate seem to seek and destroy the few high quality tv series that do emerge from the pack firefly dark matter as another reviewer well say the expanse be an island in television not since battlestar galactica have we be treat to motion picture art so well conceive in the sci fi genre hollywood seem to believe that sci fi fan be easy to please with superficial story predictable character and eye candy special effect not true although the production value of the expanse seem near unprecedented it be not why there be so many 9 10 star review on this forum rather the reason be good story tell not too much reveal too fast but enough to keep big interesting question smolder and mercifully the writer spare us long passage of explanatory dialog instead we re invite to use our imagination and even watch episode repeatedly if you ve read the sa corey book you delight at the manner in which they be here bring to life if you haven you ll be seriously entertain and perhaps inspire to do so with all the high quality literary work in the genre hollywood have no excuse that something as good as the expanse be so rare as there be certainly no shortage of deep multi layer captivate universerses why it be so rare can say can say however that m damn glad the people behind the production the expanse care so much about their creation and that they be be support by the industry here to 10 more season
bad act bad write predictable end for vendetta be well dressed bad movie it be well funded and star natalie portman so it look great but the writing and the plot be awful it be plain predictable lack excitement lack originality and generally lack the ability to draw me into the fiction engage with the character and make me forget be watch movie the underlying political message couldn have be more obvious if they have spoon fed it to you in 3d don think this review be about bias my personal politics be pretty much in line with the film as movie people film and its trivia be hobby and pastime thank heaven for netflix my wife and typically pick them well and m big fan of comic book theme or stylized film but for only the second time in 15 year of go to the movie together we discover afterward that we have both consider suggesting just leave half way in the only other be wait to exhale
should only work for people who haven see anything in the genre want to start by say that live for crime mystery so be 100 in the target audience m quite familiar with the genre and love everything in it by default however this movie have too many flaw and can understand how it have such high score my only guess be that most of the people who vote be incredibly unfamiliar with the genre and don have reference point anyway let get to the chase for crime mystery it incredibly important to get the audience to ask the right question there have to be very few very clear and interesting question and this be the most important thing the movie do not get right the question change all the time they be too many they be unclear too simple some too easy to figure out anyway and we have this issue both in regard to the plot and to the character so the mystery part be do incredibly poorly the crime part be almost ok but lot of the time it all over the place we didn get proper view of the picture in regard to the crime that take place what exactly be do and how what the police see as be suspicious and why dissection of the motif of the character and you know and actual investigation it would have be fine if it wasn such crucial part of the story and if at least the mystery or the drama be very good so next on the list be the drama this be the only genre that actually have something to offer here try to work with the character difference in moral stance and ethic be very good idea unfortunately this part of the script be in embryonic state believe that if they go with that as their main guiding line and main genre the movie could have be very good lastly if you go in expect comedy hope you will be able to see any it be beyond me how this be even list as genre here the movie be light and easy to digest but that not really comedy other general note 1 casting be fine but have no idea what they be even try to do with the daniel craig character in the beginning need quite some time just to get use to him and for the rest of the movie he be below average admit truly can even guess their intention there other than that find the casting and act to be enjoyable 2 find the music to be just as messy as the story and the mix of genre be sympathetic because it must have be really difficult to figure out what the movie be suppose to be and therefore how to make the soundtrack 3 would really like to say something good or that would recommend it anyway to people who haven see anything of the genre at least unfortunately just can do that it felt undercooked and messy would not watch any sequel they decide to make any british crime movie or tv show be hundred time well in all aspect so why waste my time hope this be not where detective movie be head first kenneth branagh and now this there be plenty of people who know how to make these movie right just give them chance hollywood

a not so little gem along the others my first comment be among these day when film be fast suppose to be excite this film be slow with subtle word and action it be so rare to witness that should recommend watch more film like this one not to mention the performance of the actor who give this feeling don about the crew or producer but the director paolo sorrentino have nail it all of it
human ambition there be several extraordinary thing about blade runner 1 it do not state who good and who bad 2 it throw you into scenario that you ll probably not enjoy 3 it doesn bother to explain why thing be the way they be 4 it show us something that although it doesn exist anywhere still have an existential meaning to us apart from that blade runner have the best score ever vangelis create style that in its simplicity strike you far more as be of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do the thing be refer to in 4 be grow up without experience of his own that be logical impossibility paradox but paradoxically it one of the most powerful stimulus of existential reflection that be ever show in cinema the point be that it let you ask yourself what all your experience be good for not quite so subtle yet still of interest be the idea that you could be bear into life know full well what your purpose be and how long you ll live what do that do to you the film answer that though it unacceptable you ll deny it seek something else something more it just can not be that everything will be lose like tear in rain but human ambition be much broad theme of this film the world itself in which blade runner take place be statement about the human longing for progress and power his forwardness and his backwardness some concept seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective but the overall atmosphere be right on the spot and in this respect have to say that the original cut have the good end because of the contrast because of all the emotion that be awaken by that contrast which do not appear cheesy but rather estrange release into the completely unknown
2 star cause the end be good love qt but m sorry get it intent and it art and m an old man so understood all the reference but this movie bore the heck out of me sit there and watch and watch and wait pacino be good margot dancing be probably some of the best scene and the crazy end either than that it wasn anything special
dezi arnaz jr can act who know that dezi arnaz jr could act well sortof vincent price christopher lee peter cushing john carradine sheila keith and julie peasgood do most of the act for him and make him look fairly acceptable as the straight man hero there lot of fun here with all the long time king of horror who be live at the time this be make enough plot twist to keep you guess lot of secret passage and mysterious happening scooby doo would be right at home production value be pretty good some genuine scare that might be too much for the little one in your family not enough gore for the hard core slasher fan contain my favorite vincent price line of all time please don interrupt me whilst be soliloquize
overrate sappy drama little more than average drama for popular taste predictable overly sentimental and excessively long it a mystery to me that such mediocre piece of cinematic art be at number 2 in the all time chart however predictably it not in the top 100 more serious sight and sound critic and director poll that be hold every ten year frank darabont later prove to be no master with his two follow film the second rate the green mile and the truly appal the majestic the fact that this pedestrian movie be in this chart ahead of the work of real master such as kubrick welles kurosawa fellini and hitchcock cause consternation 6

alan moore curse hold true alan moore be the author of the original graphic novel from which this movie be base it be work of literary art from cover to cover and one of my all time favorite read right up there with virginia woolf and william wordsworth however there be hollywood curse loom over his head you see several of his story have make it to the big screen whether you realize it or not swamp thing 1982 while he didn create the character he reinvent and repopularized him which be what prompt the movie in the first place from hell 2001 the league of extraordinary gentleman 2003 also during the 80s another of his work watchman be opt but the movie fell through before fruition and he be fight to get the right back for year now big studio own the movie right and be go ahead with it against his wish why against his wish because every single movie have be an abhorrent perversion of his original work while it be probably the best movie adaptation of his work for vendetta be still tragically horrible representation of moore message it be twist into cheap hollywood propaganda to try and poke fun at the current us administration as much as enjoy anything that take george bush and co down peg or two don enjoy be manipulate and that how this movie make me feel it also veer very far off the point of the graphic novel by cut out every significant subplot and twist the overall idea of the graphic novel be about break down any and all barrier and boundary to discover one true self and connection with the world around you the movie on the other hand push an agenda of liberalism within the constricts of currently acceptable western social archetype and not to mention the vastly different end which be the nail in the coffin for me that the wachowski brother just simply didn get it the pacing be hinder with the badly time badly integrated flashback particularly one of the most important scene of evey discovery of valerie note without any of the of other storytelling element of moore original graphic novel the flashback feel force and divisive another major flaw be the exceptionally crappy matrix effect during the climatic or rather anti climatic end fight scene it one thing for bullet to ripple the air in computer simulation but another for knife to have ugly window mouse trail in unnecessary slow motion the scene have no purpose no soul no tension it be bore the only save grace of the film be hugo weaving who provide perfect voice for the mask unfortunately all the best line from the comic be cut be leave feel exceptionally rigid and lucid calculating and painfully sane and while calculate he certainly be in the comic sane he be not the madness and therefore the joy of not know what he say or do next be lose his plan be obvious and uninspired as be this movie it didn make me want to change the world or change myself it just make me want to write alan moore an apology letter for have watch this movie could go on and on about how they ruin evey character by write her as too strong too smart and too independent and overly romanticize her and especially consider how she think might be her father in the original work but ve waste enough of my time on this movie which never plan on see again
a fairytale only tarantino could make wonderful thrilling film this be what should have happen but didn happen leave the theater in trance know what really go down this be quentin fantasy of hollywood that wasn plague by manson though all performance be great brad pitt an all star as problematic man who may or may not have kill his wife and leonardo dicaprio be perfect as depressed tv star the real mvp be the pitbull brandy best dog actor have ever see
a movie denounce as one side by those that be one side come home in state of uncomfortable distress after watch this movie it be an hour now since it end and still can shake the feeling that awaken the spirit of the bosnian war in such gruesome fashion be in bad taste however also feel the need to address some of the unfounded accusation make against the movie and its director in some of the more politically motivated review in fact this be my first imdb review register an account for the purpose of do this movie justice be the movie one side depend on what you mean by the term all war movie be one side in way no wwii movie depict the german and the ally or even the german and the soviet as equally guilty there a reason for that they re not while both side in every war be always guilty of cruelty there be always one side that excel in that department in wwii that side be clearly the german in the bosnian war those line be far more blurred let assume for the sake of argument that no side be more guilty than the others the fact remain that the movie only depict serbian crime but that be only natural for movie that take place in serbian prison camp inside serbian territory imagine if movie about auschwitz make quick jump to soviet gulag for the sake of balance that wouldn be fair or neutral it would be perfectly ridiculous in order for in the land of blood and honey to show croatian or muslim crime it would have to miraculously float out of the set into different place with different set of character in fact angelina jolie make point of allow her character to at least verbally describe the other side atrocity and make admittedly relatively tame attempt at put some blame on the international union and its response or lack there of rade serbedzija monologue about the hanjar division which be predominantly muslim unit operate within heinrich himmler s be far more successful it explain that the innate hatred he have for muslim didn come out of 1990s politics the people of ex yugoslavia have be in war civil and otherwise against one another much before there be camera to record it you may complain about why no movie have be make about the equally horrific croatian war camp but that argument really have no place in review of this movie in the land of blood and honey may be one side from that perspective but that one side be depict accurately so there no room for cry about it another common complaint be the lack of background in the movie why do the war happen why the hatred why the rap the thing be this movie wasn mean to be war epic and it doesn make any attempt in that direction it be personal story about two people and maybe just maybe you should have some general idea about the big military conflict in europe since wwii without angelina jolie talk you through it the script itself be compel but the serbian translation of some english expression be quite embarrass for movie with such budget surely they could afford to hire someone would could tell them that the phrase haven have this much fun in day doesn exist in that form in the serbian language and that it shouldn under any circumstance be translate literally the two main character be well define and realistic as be danijel father but the people around them be mostly sketch of stereotypical soldier and victim type this doesn hurt the movie much as no other character be really crucial to the story with that say and the count of real character low it be only natural to expect the movie to be pack with event from start to finish it seem jolie intention be to stuff every terrible aspect of the war into 2 hour and it really doesn give you any room to relax no humorous relief not even the exceptionally dark humor of some other movie about bosnia one that come to mind be pretty village pretty flame which be very good movie in its own right but look like slightly sinister comedy compare to what watch tonight all in all once you get over the fact that you be not go to be taught history lesson by this movie you may begin to see it as story of two people destroy each other in the midst of slaughter neither of them understand s the factual error on the movie page say the uniforms serbian soldier wear be not authentic be not really an error in 1992 there be no serbian army to speak of it be the yugoslav national army which be command from belgrade the soldier wear uniform with yugoslav symbol for the simple reason that they didn have any other uniform later on in the war that change and as the movie progress you don see any more communist insignia on the serb uniform in other word why be everyone so intent on nitpick about angelina jolie first effort as director
excellent this be wonderful movie lot more of an action flick than title suggests be pleasant surprise as plot unfold ben affleck be perfect for this part well write script and good acting by all nice use of flashback for character development many twist and turn and bit of surprise end watch it you win be disappoint
theater quality program on television one of the best piece of television have see among the rank with the soprano mad men etc costner fan know he have always be fascinate with the west dance with wolf open range silverado costner doesn need to make movie or tv show anymore he be great writer give the quality writing and cinematography depict in yellowstone costner be clearly enjoy make this one excellent act across the cast and the fact that most of the actor be not household name make the character more interesting would urge anyone who like smart drama to watch this series if you like western you can miss it
good young actor in good old time the movie appear to have all the necessary premise to be successful in any give aspect famous young actor quite promise begin and even some unexpected twist in the plot however some of its particularity spoil the whole impression first and foremost the story itself be not as excite to watch as it initially present some of its thread be revolve around political and financial intrigue rather bore background whereas the mystery itself be short and quite straightforward apart from several rare turn on top of that the main female character image be not develop enough she lack any emotion or memorable trait except obsess about smoking and be ready to succumb to this dirty habit at any moment or place as for the virtue of the movie the other main personality be quite good and believable even though one might not feel for any of them additionally it indeed pleasure to watch the actor play them since they be still young and vibrant what more the atmosphere of those old time feels very nostalgic and noirish
this get non committal eh be tell by several friend to go buy this sight unseen don bother rent it just buy it boy be glad didn this movie be average in the extreme on the plus side yes the animation be excellent the close up facial feature and attention to detail be fantastic jason lee voice work be excellent as well however the story never really take off want more time spend on the child give me more detail about their problem so that when they come into their own later in the movie it would mean more didn get it bad of all there be very little humor in the past pixar have be know to have good dose of wit in their movie this one have almost none have go in know this be 99 drama probably would have be much less disappointed don get me wrong this be still pretty solid film it isn really bad by any mean but it be just not as good as the hype would lead you to believe
stunningly bad streep performance painfully overact streep make it annoyingly obvious that we be watch an actor her signature snootiness and drag out inflection pregnant pause hitch sentence glass fidgetting head in hand dismay stare down etc etc etc ugh ugh ugh all contrive in dust off all her trademark ism she sink the ship dialogue so dull it can be resurrect not even by hank even the suspenseful music felt contrived movie try so hard to be important think it be make big difference take itself so seriously that it be almost humorous can blame the film technique because well bob odenkirk he overcome all the bad card he be dealt and rise above the abysmal film emerge as the best performer in the group
ridiculous action get tiresome hannibal liam neeson face bradley cooper a baracus quinton rampage jackson and murdock sharlto copley be iraqi vet who be wrongly imprison for steal us currency print plate they escape from prison to recover the plate but they may be double cross once again liam neeson be too grumpy bradley cooper be good have fun with face sharlto copley be bad murdock the problem be that these character be so iconic in tv history other than cooper nobody really hit it on the head this be just an excuse to put in ridiculous action it all very disappointing it miss the heart of the tv show it miss the humor and the chemistry of the group
enjoyable but imperfect the grifter see john cusack play roy dillon grifter whose loyalty be split between his con artist girlfriend annette bening and his estranged mother anjelica huston in tangled web of deceit with bloody consequence cusack put in good performance as the grifter play the short con make money from people wherever he can whilst try to avoid be seduce into the long con by myra bening while also try to resolve bizarre almost oedipal relationship with his estranged mother lilly huston the slightly neurotic anti hero with humorous cool streak be the kind of role he can play in his sleep and from what hear be similar to his role in ice harvest 2005 bening be different she more lively than cusack and certainly sleazy her pretty face slimline figure and cheerful willingness to strip off hide the vicious deceiver that lie underneath and you can help but feel concerned for cusack as she try to reel him into her scam huston performance be however the best of all and lilly remain the most complex character in the grifter from the moment she introduce in cusack somewhat sparse apartment you can see there more to this relationship than they let on there an obvious sexual tension sustain between the two until the film climax the darker side of her come to light in the film final third threaten on all side she become an animal fighting for survival and show that she will go to any length to get what she need her kill roy sum this up while her initial reaction be one of maternal grief she soon switch back into survival mode and quickly get out the cinematography be fantastic the grifter really achieve the noir look thanks to some clever camera work effective lighting and somewhat austere scenery the character especially lilly and myra look the part and you can clearly see the influence here the score while not use much also contribute effectively to create tense and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere but isn afraid to be loud and dramatic when need be however the grifter be not perfect despite solid performance decent script and visual effectiveness it seem to be miss something and be unfortunately flaw as all good noir character be perhaps it a little too long or the script isn quite good enough or the tempo be tad too low couldn put my finger on it these small factor don detract too much from what be otherwise very good film definitely worth watch
it all double dutch villain jack carter michael caine have return to his home town of newcastle to investigate his brother suspicious death carter have spend year in london but have miraculously lose all trace of his native accent and adopt kind of cockney brogue even stranger all the resident of newcastle and district have also lose their local accent even while continue to live there and they speak with kind of undefined pseudo northern twang there be two exception one be carter friend keith play by alun armstrong and the other be the scrap dealer see early in the film and play by alan hockey both these actor have local connection these inconsistency render the picture immediately false although apart from this major criticism it be all it be crack up to be gritty and involve british gangster picture if you believe the accent don really matter imagine film set in scotland where all the character speak with dutch accent of course to viewer unfamiliar with the inflection of north east england this may not be too noticeable or important it be surprising that this glaring anomaly be mostly ignore unnoticed or gloss over by commentator on this website and elsewhere regard the film carter have little affection for his home city and be bent on retribution as he wander through series of grimy location which contrast with the affluent lifestyle of crook kinnear john osborne and brumby bryan mosley who live in the countryside there be no goody in get carter everyone have past or something to hide and revenge be the key to the plot as carter be an avenge angel or devil who eventually succumb himself after wipe out several of those involve in his brother murder the location be often striking car drive at speed along the quayside under the tyne bridge the gun battle on the walker hebburn ferry carter pursuit of eric ian hendry on the coal staiths at blyth and dawn police raid on kinnear mansion the film portrays crime and criminal as something unpleasant nothing glamorous here vengeance be nasty brutal and swift not one to make you feel uplifted but nevertheless one of the best british crime picture
good movie m go to have to disagree with the critic on this one can believe that elektra get such bad score mean at least high six for god sake this movie be great action movie and garner show her physical ability in this movie the dialogue be bit crisp sometimes and get little thin with the usual martial art you can do it and that type of inspire stuff the movie overall be very entertaining and the acting be good there be lot of great special effect the editing be ok there be complaint on how the main guy die think the death could ve be more elaborate and more vengeful the story isn bad at all guess it just matter of taste if you like movie that be close to the reality side go watch another movie if you re open to thing that aren really tie in with what real you might like this it action pack and plot wise well it actually not that bad elektra be lose in morality and doesn know who she be by the end she find herself again with the help of people along the way the little love thing they have go don know about that there be hardly any chemistry although both actor be capable the movie be well do and be good enough for me to be expect sequel just keep in mind this be more of the definition of elektra and finding who she be maybe in the next movie if there be one there ll be more sense of reality to it have fun with it
terrible apart from the odd jumpy bit there be serious amount of quality whoever write this script will hopefully never write another one unless its for scary movie possibly people be openly laugh at some of the line the lack of attention to the script ruin the movie for me make it lose all of its scare factor completely the only excuse for this be if they be actually try to make some of the character purposely funny the actor lack of quality make this even hard to interpret they manage to create house full of unbelievable character towards the end felt like be watch home alone meet scary movie very poor show the plot also lack depth at the end we don fully understand how what have happen happen there be so many moment that be laughable honestly don understand how anyone could ever think this be good piece of cinema at all save you re money and don see it
how exhaust watch this just don understand what it be that make this movie so popular especially with male viewer mean 8 6 come on what be that leonard suffers from short term memory loss and track back use note and body part to find the man who kill his wife on his journey he encounter number of people who he have to be able to assess at first sight because of his deficiency the acting by guy pearce be very convincing and even appeal but the story however be most of the time way too irritating because you constantly have to backtrack yourself in order to completely understand what go on like flashback in movie but film that turn out to be one big flashback by itself may be little too demand for me guess this be just not my kind of entertainment
spectacularly well do it certainly help that cooper king kong be the inspiration for jackson to enter the art business of film making and give us some great film like heavenly creatures the lord of the ring trilogy and now his vision of the eighth wonder of the world the film tell carefully construct tale jackson manage not only to deliver an escapist fun and exciting adventure but perhaps one of the more emotionally evoke film of recent memory one go through many stage of feeling know do cheer as kong battle three rex in order to protect his new friend the lovely ann darrow naomi watts brings such warmth to the character that she certainly would make the late wray proud jackson and of course andy serkis make the mighty kong an especially deep character for gorilla we learn so much from one shot that show the audience kong cave fill with the bone and memory of lose family and friend people have misinterpret kong relationship with darrow as romance when it be clearly friendship the film be visually astound although the film open in depress depression era 1933 new york it be beautifully construct skull island and its indigenous population get the job do as far as scare tactic go as do the many creature of the island don think ll ever get over the insect pit black portrayal of denham be welcome enough although still prefer armstrong sort of car salesman approach to denham as oppose to black greed creepy face stout filmmaker adrien brody be also fine with what he be give there isn much to say about driscoll here since the film want to concern itself with ann and kong by the way the last scene on skull island before we see kong in new york city go beyond emotion want to cry my discrepancy with the film lie with two thing the ugly look and almost unnecessary brontosaurus chase in the early part of the skull island act and this needless subplot concern the ship captain first mate mr hayes and his friendship with stowaway jimmy it clearly do not go anywhere and it doesn seem to impact the audience in any way overall there be so much more to jackson king kong than meet the eye it be truly one of the best film of recent memory
great but not 3 hour great great film very entertaining but it be way too long it didn need to be 3 hour long have no problem with film be 3 hour long if it have 3 hour worth of quality material this film do not most film do not that be why they be edit down to remove the fluff to keep the audience they spend way too much time develop the background story of both denham and ann even though neither background story have any impact on the film as whole nor the film climax nor anything beyond reach the island peter jackson seem to think that just because it work for the lord of the ring trilogy that he can make every film with an extended running time what he fail to realize be that one of the most important skill in film making if be able to cut the film down to it best and most entertaining edit the lotr film have so much material because of tolken not jackson save the fluff footage for dvd extra or what be the point of edit in the first place this be king kong it be not historical epic like gettysburg or braveheart this be king kong not brilliant story like seven samuri this film be very entertaining eventually once it get go enjoy it and will probably purchase the dvd recommend it to everyone but only if you be able to sit through the fluff to get to the actual film most of you will turn it off before see it brilliance this film succeed in make the viewer feel for the beast and they really bring out the love story between beauty and the beast very well

beautiful imagery disappointing content the photography in this movie be absolutely stun the landscape be amazing and so be the indoor shot the manipulation of colour be do masterfully as well but other than that have trouble find any substance to the film enjoy some scene the interaction between actor but most of them do not feel real so didn really take anything from it there be several slow part where scene be replay from different perspective and it mostly interest for the sexual discovery the character partake actually there be not much to it other than the sex it be okay different from what usually watch but be expect something more special especially after watch such an amazing trailer

mixed response some strong point though overall 5 10 film critic as primer on race relation what make zebrahead unique and uniquely fascinating be its point of view the film begin with an assumption largely ignore in the work of spike lee or john singleton belief that young white american be be heavily influence by urban black culture by the music and the language and the dress by the mania of arsenio hall and the magic of michael jordan so the script take an admittedly extreme example of that influence white teen ager rear in the predominantly black environs of detroit and examine the implication can cultural condition yield tolerance and empathy as readily as it generate prejudice and hate the question itself be hopeful and the movie delivers complex answer with subtlety and style make his feature debut writer director anthony drazan have do his homework well he too be the product of culturally mixed background and man with an obvious zest for research shooting over 60 hour of video footage in new york city high school drazan use that raw material as the basis for his fictional screenplay change the setting to the urban fringe of the motor city and find his alter ego in the youthful character of zack michael rapaport jewish kid who by sheer dint of exposure be more on the home boy side than the white boy side the result be vibrant picture that from the rough dialogue to the hip hop soundtrack from the electronic hall monitor to the washroom crackheads resonate with the ring of truth certainly for zack his home boy side be not an assumed pose but nurtured fact he naturally love the music that flow around him his best friend be black because so be many of his classmate ditto for nikki bushe wright the new girl in town the one with the sassy manner and the sweet smile when zack and nikki go out on saturday night it feel natural inevitable of course that single date become the pebble toss in the pond and the rest of the film trace the tragic ripple the revealed pattern be intrigue the fortysomethings the teen agers parent and teacher be wholly incapable of view the relationship through anything but racial lens some be more laissez faire than others zack philander dad ray sharkey seem to have transcend bigotry by abandon any emotion but all be fearful pessimistic the same be largely true of the kid peer yet there be few tell exception young adult who as way of life not as matter of principle have genuinely break through the colour barrier it may be sentimental to argue as the film do that hope rest with the young but it not sentimental to show exactly how and why despite some small flaw few too many plot complication and recur visual image that seem tack on that drazan real triumph here within the turmoil and the tragedy he explore there emerge glint of hope that doesn smack of wishful thinking and hope breed hope one want to believe that by extension the glint can become beacon and that racially mixed high school can double as an educational microcosm trouble hotspot that grow the seed of solution from within the very problem it create yes one dearly want to believe and zebrahead give us reason benjamin miller filmbay editor
i want to like it more be so excited for this movie because love the book and comic and everything surround it in some way it really dissapoints and think if youre really interested by the chracters read the book
good film but not that good typically don like silent film but decide to watch this one for two reason first usually like sci fi movie and second metropolis have receive so many glow review that couldn pas it up however my opinion of this film be below what most reviewer have be say kino digitally remastered version on dvd be very impressive the sound and picture quality be both excellent however have to conclude that favorable review of this film be likely base on nostalgia on the film influence on future film and on the incredible visual effect give its year of release film history buff and silent film fan should see this movie think this be good film but not great one rating of 8 3 be much too high and at 93 there be plenty of good film rank below it first the good part of the film 1 the special effect be excellent for pre 1930s film 2 the mindlessness of the working class be portray well in how they work the decision they make and in how easily they be lead mislead 3 the main character be well develop throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well 4 the film be visually stunning and impressive 5 the story of the work class vision of the future machine men etc have have very strong influence on many film which come later on the other hand here be list of what could have be do well 1 many scene drag on too long and be tedious can imagine it be any long than it already be 2 the difference between the think class and the working class be not clear both seem to be pretty mindless 3 the theme and idea in the film have be explore well in other production 4 the set design and special effect be not as good as they be in the 1936 film thing to come 5 thing to come also have far more interesting and creative vision of the future 6 joh fredersen be not well develop and his motif and decision seem illogical for the leader of the think class 7 there be no explanation for how the spiritual and motivational leader of the working class become so intelligent capable and or competent more background on maria would have help develop her character and improve the film in its defense it could be that be not as impress by this film simply because so many film which come after it have copy borrow steal or re worked idea that appear here first metropolis certainly be trend setter like say before don think this be bad film it simply overrate and ve see plenty of film that be good but be rat low
supremely thrill suspenseful and visually breathtaking the lost world be summer blockbuster sequel do right the lost world jurassic park the sequel to steven spielberg iconic blockbuster be release to massive commercial success but critical disappointment while audience flock to see the follow up to the high grossing movie of all time critic lambast the movie for fail to live up to the high mark set by its groundbreaking predecessor m here to set the record straight the critic be demonstrably wrong the lost world be one of the most underrated and over hated movie of recent memory four year after jurassic park captivate audience around the world steven spielberg return to the director chair to craft sequel that match the original in every area that matter the lost world be as technically accomplish as thrilling and as exquisitely craft as the highly praised jurassic park critic be damn michael crichton sequel novel serf as inspiration for the lost world story which introduce isla sorna or site as its main setting this island be the site where jurassic park dinosaur be breed and raise after the event of jurassic park the site be abandon and dinosaur roam free once again in proverbial lose world ian malcolm the neurotic chaotician from the first film be the centerpiece figure of the lost world substitute for sam neil alan grant who be leave out of crichton book malcolm girlfriend sarah harding julianne moore and her team of biologist be send to isla sorna to study the unique animal on the island meanwhile ingen team lead by great white hunter roland tembo play with scene steal gusto by the late great pete postlethwaite come to capture some of the island large inhabitant ian malcolm learns of this news and take it upon himself to retrieve his girlfriend from the dinosaur infest island the lost world doesn bother much with exposition after the piece be put in place it non stop dino action but david koepp script be not simple mind here be story that in its own way still develop its character and encourage engagement there be idea present in the lost world on greed nature human hubris which be more than you can say about its successor one of the criticism the lost world often receive be that it lack the compelling character of the first film it a complaint that hold no water moore wide eye overly enthusiastic dr harding vince vaughn militant eco activist nick van owen the aforementioned big game hunter tembo and the rest of the new character be in the most basic sense well draw what they lack in situational awareness hater will have you know that there be dumb decision make by some they make up for in personality love them or hate them these be real character people with passion and flaw not the fleshy placeholder of jp3 and jurassic world and that not to mention jeff goldblum who carry the protagonist load admirably when you think about it his role here be not only different from the first film but different from most anything goldblum have do we know he can do quirky but his understated cynicism here come off totally natural all the way through malcolm be the ultimate grounding force among all the dinosaur chaos huge asset to the movie the cogent story and memorable character as welcome as they be be only the icing on this cake the essence of the lost world be its fantastic dinosaur action here be where this movie outclass nearly all its competitor the lost world be steven spielberg flex his cinematic muscle he take the set piece trailer dangle off cliff basecamp ambush by territorial rex or raptor hunt in long grass and weave from them some real tension suspense and above all thrill spielberg know how to tease an action scene and have it explode to life at just the right time even when thing move to san diego in the final act the richness of spielberg action remain his sense for visual iconography like glass slowly crack shadow streak across tent and trail be make in grass be unparalleled we ve grow use to modern action that numb the sens but the satisfaction of spielberg action be that it enrich them at this point he just show off but what be dinosaur action without the dinos themselves if jurassic park redefine creature effect for the modern age the lose world perfect them combine the very best of both animatronics and digital effect stan winston and ilm create dinosaur even more dazzling than those in jurassic park the intricately detailed large scale animatronics move smoothly with wide range of motion and the cgi be as photo real as anything in 1997 or today for that matter but what separate these dinosaur from other movie monster be the way they be treat as character the dinosaur of the lost world jurassic park be write and direct with constant eye for realism the rex parent the big star of the film don chase and eat people just because they be rex when they attack we know why they exhibit maternal instinct when their baby be take from them and territorial instinct when the scientist venture too far into their domain as do the stegosaurus in fabulous early scene it be credit to writer david koepp that film that could have easily devolve into mindless action maintain certain level of intelligence even in its most fantastic moment and we aren just tell that the dinosaur be animal not monster they actually behave that way the rex sniff the air for sign of their baby the raptor snap at each other during hunt the compys swarm piece of food drop on the beach these moment feel like they be take from documentary of course this be how dinosaur would behave they be give reason to roar and chase when the lazy thing to do would be to create dinosaur that exist only to look cool okay so the story may not be as fresh as the original jurassic park can buy that but the lost world match the first movie in nearly every other way the special effect action score set design cinematography you name it they all carry the same mark of quality as the original jurassic park there be passion behind the creation of the lost world jurassic park novel from michael crichton steven spielberg at the helm ilm and stan winston at the top of their respective game and john williams provide the music this be the only jurassic park sequel that can stand with the original it do exactly what big budget sequel should do it skip through the requisite set up and launch full force into the thrill the lost world be jam pack with jaw drop special effect and pulse pound action yet it stay smart enough and scary enough to feel fulfil it the very best kind of summer popcorn entertainment and without question the best sequel to jurassic park 89 100

a serviceable film which have enjoyable aspect however it be wholly formulaic and occasionally cringe induce when first saw night at the museum at the movie didn know whether really like it or not in fact my reaction to it be so mixed that it confound me now that have manage to formulate an opinion can proceed with write this review that be say my expectation for night at the museum be hardly great indeed my friend and only saw it because we have much to our chagrin arrive too early to see the critically acclaimed borat or casino royale we decide to see it because of the presence of the usually steady ben stiller despite his star billing expect night at the museum to be standard family fare not bad just predictable and formulaic my expectation be fulfil there be bad scene mostly involve stiller and his son which introduce overpower cringe induce sentiment the plot be also uninspired revolve around stereotypical loser with downtrodden son and marital difficulty wait on be this reprise of the appal jingle all the way the sad part be that my friend and manage to telegraph key area of the plot and also many of the various subplots the rap music which be dub over the credit be also out of place with the rest of the movie not only can see the presence of the rap music potentially turn off parent from see the movie but the rap also leave bad taste in my mouth the acting be mixed bag certainly not the bad ve see in family orient movie but hardly consistent for instance while ben stiller be his usual steady self he manage to deliver few funny line due to various limitation in the script he be also force to engage in some slapstick which contradict his usually wry understated sense of humour as see on meet the parent the monkey scene be not only predictable but it be probably the bad scene in the movie the son jake cherry do not have to do great deal other than mug for the camera mickey rooney be saddle with the most poorly write character in the film result in him spit out plethora of lame buzzword butterscotch however owen wilson and steve coogan as the cowboy and roman general respectively inject some life into the proceeding be responsible for most of the amusing part for example their individual stoushes robin williams for once decide not to revert to slapstick attempt to play his character in more understated fashion and you know what he isn annoy in fact didn realise it be him until later dick van dyke while not particularly funny use his oft likable personality to hold the movie together ricky geravis also play the stereotypical pedantic whimsical bos to perfection it become evident to me that night at the museum be very much movie of moment fortunately these moment usually come at just the right time just when my interest in the film be flag and my eye be be divert towards my watch for instance couldn help but laugh at the sacajawea track scene have already discuss the stoushes between the cowboy and the roman general so will discuss the most interesting part of the movie the only part of the plot which display any real innovation it be always go to be interest watch how stiller would go about overcome his problem in the museum and he come up with some entertaining and left field solution for do so for instance there be the fire extinguisher which he use on the caveman alongside others ve also see less amusing ending to family movie as silly as the disco scene be ultimately find night at the museum slightly difficult to rate it be certainly passable movie with its fair share of well time and enjoyable moment however this be offset by the overbearing sentiment the predictability of the plot and to lesser extent the credit and the less desirable act performance in the film all thing consider this be far less banal and money grubbing than the more insipid family fare such as scooby doo or garfield this be say nothing though guess will have to tie my review up with rating so will give night at the museum 2 5 5 star perhaps little high for those in the target genre
a fun ride but something miss this be an interesting concept surely not genre play out much in hollywood the cast be jam pack with all star give great but not their best performances the miss piece of the puzzle character development that not to say that there be any lack of interesting character each of the four horseman bring very unique style to the movie besides henley she rather weak as character and the sheer amount of talent present in each scene guarantee that you ll be entertain 10 10 hardly but definitely solid 8 for me entertain fun and definitely concept worth explore on the big screen just remember the closer you look the less you ll actually see
bad bad casting bland cinematography and awful dialogue
pretty tame despite spirited performance from marcia do vale and solid performance from emily atack there nothing here to recommend there be zombie and there the spanish location as it say on the tin but there nothing novel here and this be pretty tame in term of zombie action and pretty lacklustre when it come to comedy

not feel it the preview be intrigue the creative genius of pixar tackle the human psyche on fundamental level unfortunately this film drag on with very little plot or substance the anthropomorphic representation of emotion and memory be cute but ultimately fail to provide the kind of sustained entertainment experience of other pixar film basically it seem like enough story to fill out short repeat several time to make feature perhaps the film do capture the essence of pre teen middle class white girl angst and it do have few very poignant moment but ultimately it lack the layered humor well direct action and general entertainment value that have come to expect from pixar on brighter note the short that precede this film lava be awesome
what be that garbage this movie be so boring cant believe even kid movie be become stupid to hate the new time can we go back in time please

won cure insomnia this film be on cable one night it lose steam quickly as the story become bogged down with pointless silly situation the plot meander so much that have to read the synopsis as the story progress if you have pvr and your record it feel free to stop it and check other movie on cable that what do however do finish watching it if this movie have be quiet throughout it would have help insomniacs to finally get good night sleep watch paint dry be well alternative one of the irony of this film have to do with one of its producer mark wahlberg wahlberg be one of the lead in peter jackson the lovely bone prisoner be poor ripoff of that movie the lovely bone be superior film in every respect prisoner isn a film that worth watch more than once the lovely bone be
plot hole from the start first off want to say even for all the plot hole in this movie it be still an ok movie to watch but just could not find it as enjoyable as could when the kid you have to root for be snot nosed little brat you want to smack the crap out of yourself say that though even for when this movie be make the outstanding mistake make by the legal part of this movie be beyond me first off you have cop intimidate child witness which make no sense second when mark be first bring in to talk to the lawyer they never would have anyway interview him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kid statement as soon as he take the stand and have all evidence throw out of court thirdly this be all base on what the lawyer might have tell the kid which consider there be no proof they could ever possibly know what be actually talk about in the car all all mark have to say be the guy just talk about want to die and the fbi could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be throw out fourth and finally even if mark admit that the lawyer tell him something the fbi couldn do anything with it because it be hearsay and also it break client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer tell mark so it in no way could have be use as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in court of law also at one point in the movie the fbi hears on wire tap the guy they want pretty much admit to the crime and to want to whack the kid which be more than enough evidence they need to arrest him ok movie but just full of to many plot hole to make any real sense
try not to vomit wait for that dull end literally almost vomit the first 30mins really gross scene old redundant message deliver in the most extreme way the upper echelon waste while the less fortunate be face with deadly resolution to not starve and also stay alive pointless end believe the government care about the people they put into deadly compromise situation
reason to watch as state earlier there be only so many time one can watch japanese guy fall out of tree the slapstick in this be of such desperate and unpleasant quality it ll give you headache but if you be look for reason to watch they be as follow open credit they be paint on giant plywood rabbit that be place outside and then film it make for colorful and crazy opening arch jr the guy actually show some star power here casual and cool look unfortunately he isn in it very much he sing only one song last and not least the girl jackie she be totally cute just gorgeous and photographed very well sort of natalie portman esque in her charm why never in another film
maybe saw the wrong film yikes this be the second classic m reviewing in the same day where my opinion be almost the polar opposite of the consensus the other be thing to come 1936 at least do not feel that be complete disaster the final third be actually quite good and there be occasional moment of artistic merit prior to that further you should watch at least once for the same reason that you should head out to see the emperor parade by in his new clothes at least once namely because everyone be talk about it lot of people be be influence by it and so on but be far from masterpiece compare to classic hitchcock be almost criminal the hot air that regularly emit about this film could fill million balloon for street vendor the first two third of be pretty bad almost couldn make it to the end which would have be shame and m someone who be almost _never_ tempt to bail out on film the crux of the story be that there be serial killer target young girl in large german city the time period be the film present the police be have difficulty catch the killer who be regularly make the headline of the local paper especially as the killer keep write taunt note to be publish after the late murder large vigilante group of panicked citizen include fair number of criminal decides to take action they organize divide up the city into quadrant for different people to patrol and they try to keep the police uninvolved the problem with the majority of the film in nutshell be that the storytelling be extremely sloppy the script co write by director fritz lang be all over the map there be way too many character the audience doesn get to know any of them at least in the first hour instead it be scene after scene of people we ve never meet before mostly sit or stand around and fret about how they re go to catch the killer lang direction be extremely flat and the editing be even bad the pacing be horrible there be superfluous pregnant pause around every corner there be lot of superfluous insert shot there be lot of poorly choose camera placement the absence of score except for the killer whistle famous bit of edvard grieg peer gynt doesn help there be no character to care about there be no character to follow into story the scene have all the flow of wait for two hour in dentist office the dialogue be bland and the plot unfolds very linearly this be even true when the film improve in its final third there be no surprise or twist to be have here all of the information that the police and the vigilante need basically fall right into their lap they hardly run into kink there be couple small problem but they re easily resolve for thriller have very little tension the first hour be more in the realm of police procedural but it very slow at that and the police aren in it enough or at least there not enough procedure show to make it work be also consider film noir but residence in that genre be more superficial here at any rate it doesn help create an engaging film but as mention there be few moment of value in the first hour these mostly come by way of cinematographic symbolism for example one shot show child balloon be ensnare in power line that and roll ball be sufficient to convey that the child have fall into the killer trap and be now dead some of the interesting symbolism be bit heavy hand but still attractive for example potential child victim who end up in front of store picture window beneath large arrow point down at her and next to hypnotically spin spiral the improvement arrive once the vigilante mob believe it have the killer corner this be more than an hour into the film the sequence where they re take the place apart be well direct and actually become suspenseful we finally get to know couple character later include two member of the police force the crown scene feature peter lorre as han beckert give an impassioned speech before huge vigilante mob he defend himself before kangaroo court yes lorre be excellent here but he not in the film enough 15 minute of an excellent performance with scattered moment elsewhere be surely not enough to put on best film of all time list lang have interesting thing to say about vigilante justice and criminal culpability but the vigilante justice stuff be to be much good handle by lang elsewhere such as fury 1936 which be very nearly 10 beckert culpability speech cover some of the basic issue that one would in an ethics class but it not very complete it doesn delve into the ontology of choice enough and of course it doesn answer any of the issue the latter fact be probably for the good there aren really easy answer although my personal view be that choice be not strictly necessary for responsibility or culpability this scene also at least implies lot of the ethical issue involve with the formal justice system vis à vis insanity defenses the possibility of parole and so on but why couldn lang have dive right into the material of the last half hour after say 5 or 10 minute prologue the film end abruptly extend the end and cut out all of the fiddle about garbage that consume the majority of the screen time this be just bad screen write and it doesn deserve the praise it have receive
first rate performance and gem of film honestly land on the film last night browse title on netflix because of lily james have know nothing else about the film from before usually skip trailer these day but that she be in the cast be huge draw for me and find immense pleasure in this gem of film from carey mulligan and ralph fiennes to ben chaplin and archie barnes the performance be all first rate the real life story be tell with great finesse and film earnestly with keen eye for production detail have to say even some of the less moment from the film shall stay with me for long its appeal be that strong

try to resemble an 80 thriller but be too boring to even do that often ask myself why do we watch movie in the first place what do they offer us that question arises usually after really good movie or after really bad one this movie unfortunately for me be bad one get carry away and watch it because other review call it masterpiece come on please masterpiece of depression ugliness loneliness moodiness and boredom this be you must be sick in the mind and in the heart to like this film moreover call it masterpiece disturb yes in sick way everything be ugly dark dead without essence journey to the abyss of decay and misery why watch such image be people so disturbed to even tolerate film like this for entertainment or should we not call it entertainment see it as depiction of reality embrace the ugliness and so on because if one want to be disturb by reality there be plenty of really disturb stuff happen in the real world around us everyday so what be cinema an escape from what isolate oneself in dark room and absorb all these image in one consciousness why why do it have to look dark and ugly and violent to shake our mind bore yes although the cinematic view and camera angle where really interesting eu cinema fan will appreciate it the plot be really slow explain nothing and do not escalate if one have not read the book or synopsis one would really find this whole move around rather boring and without reason act hmm let me put it this way it be perhaps interesting to see such beautiful actress be transform into this depress be that do not seem human but if it be not for the famous name the character be flat filming style badly try to resemble the 80 the thing be that in the 80 movie turn out to look cheap and rat because of lack of budget bad equipment lack of act potential bad director and so on why film like that today music creepy but sophisticated sync nicely with the moody scenes why give it 2 because by no mean this be an 7 2 rating movie it be more like 4 also because it pollute my consciousness with disturb image that offer nothing to me ah yes and because it be bore and waste 2 hour of my life watch this decay of the human specie conclusion have you watch the black swan by aronofsky because that be also dark and depress but real masterpiece because it have essence it talk to the heart under the skin be not good movie if you be normal person and not sick in the mind

excusable flaw don detract there a very obvious problem when transfer any book to the big screen namely that some of us may already have see it it not that the story hold no surprise save for the occasional controversy that surround the fate of character like hannibal lecter it just that many of us have already read the book and thus we ve already direct our own version of the story we ve already see it in our mind eye and this be the problem that plague the fellowship of the ring you ll see lot of review here proclaim it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema and few that dare to knock its serious shortcoming let me clear this up right now the first issue that many may raise be that this be not faithful adaptation of the book quite right while take pain to ensure that they stay faithful to the novel jackson et al have not simply be able to lift their screenplay directly from its page without few necessary change there be great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience and it will be large who be unfamiliar with the novel accordingly great deal more emphasis have be place upon pace and storytelling more appropriate to classic film narrative hence we need to see gandalf protract bid to escape the clutch of isenguard intersperse with the hobbit journey to rivendell it simply isn appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the hobbit journey no matter how good the actor be or how enthral the story be for upwards of an hour without constant reminder of the film other protagonist or the threat of the evil they face have gandalf just turn up at rivendell and tell his story via cgi fill flashback simply wouldn have have the necessary effect secondly the omission and reworking of character yes it be sad that bakshi felt his animation didn need tom bombadill and give that he feature strongly in tolkien other work this have to be frown upon by the die hard fanatic but introduce divert but ultimately pointless episode into the list of the challenge the hobbit face be hardly go to keep you rivet to your seat be it mean man who stop the hobbit be eaten very slowly by tree with his power of song be just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age the film be already stretch the audience suspension of disbelief as far as it can go hence the chaff of bombadill be cut he isn relevant to the rest of the story so he can be do without it sad for tolkien fan for him not to be there but there only so much celluloid available even with film this long and yes arwen undomiel never save frodo from the dark rider but please remember your girlfriend need to have something to sink her teeth into as well not just midget and men with beard look mean or scar as they fight monster so for gender representation and bid to prevent half the potential market please remember that like all film this be product to be package and sell her character get drastic overhaul go sister there be numerous other issue relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please let be content with what we ve get here it a hard task to do all this well and jackson along with the rest of the boy and girl at wingnut and weta should be commend for what they have achieve that say there be some definite flaw in the film even those that can be overlook by justify the need to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience firstly we ve get the fellowship itself now merry and pippin while not really be establish as frodo friend and thus not have the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel be moderately well integrated however at the arrival of boromir gimili and legolas we just get leave in the dark none of these three character all represent important race culture and location of the world of middle earth be give no more than token arrival shot to introduce them and little or no back story as to how they come to be where they be or why they feel compel to join frodo quest offer their various weapon be noble and it sound fantastic in the trailer but when we finally get down to it we just don know who they be or what they re about accordingly we don ever really have time to care about any of these three save for legolas whose fight proficiency alone make him stand out sadly sean bean be allow little more than to switch from forebode bad guy to friendly companion and back again thus betray his character ultimate fate from the first time he open his mouth and john rhys davis be leave with little more to do than scowl and look short it doesn help that both these character seem to get pretty raw deal for screen time especially gimli who be barely in the film at all we win even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between sam and frodo all of this be indeed shame the film great strength after its story be its strong character however whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at gandalf perhaps not with humble air so much as wonder that he be allow to soak up all the screen time and yes what you ve hear be true the fight sequence be shockingly bad well perhaps that be an overstatement the fight sequence aren exactly bad they re riddled with good idea and clever move but the camerawork and editing be so erratic that you ll have hard time pick out anything to inspire awe or respect the problem here be that the benchmark for on screen fight have all be establish nowadays by the matrix crouching tiger and the phantom menace and all of these film use lengthy shot to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography rather than have us crane our neck and dart about the screen with our eyeball try to glimpse it like rare bird or nipple flash at premiere now these yet again be only few of the problem there the geography of middle earth some ropey special effect moment and the clumsy end to deal with but you can read the book and see the film for yourself ve already type enough about all that here but now that ve just spend the main chunk of this review tell you about the shortcoming of the fellowship of the ring as both movie and an adaptation let me tell you it be good exceptionally good there be no deny that the storyline itself act effect props set and so on and so forth be all spot on visually the film be triumph and weta have now without question place itself ahead of industrial light and magic in term of industry lead special effect there be bag of style to proceeding with some sequence display the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague section of the novel to life all part be play to perfection by the cast and the casting be literally some of the best and most appropriate see in year none of this who hot and who not jerry bruckheimer trash it a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film we ll give particular credit to sir ian mckellan christopher lee ian holm and elijah wood again here no doubt they ve have score of favourable and loving review already but these performance truly be worth mention just once again the film be masterpiece from start to finish yes it do take perseverance no it not entirely faithful to tolkien work and there be some serious flaw but in year that have be so barren of even five decent mainstream movie think it safe to say that no matter when this film have be release it would have outshine its competitor
a flattering portrait of an evil regime m resubmitting my review edit of course because someone say it be offensive the first time what do say about this movie the first time to summarize give it 7 of 10 rat it one star to make it easy to find among 300 review mostly 10 star say it be well make also say it glorify an evil regime base that on the premise that it do not show dead adolf be that the offensive part that didn address him as mr hitler be his dead body so sacred that they would show everyone else corpse except his bullet ridden head be that too taboo to show in modern german film be the filmmaker too scar to show that say it wasn show because the purpose of this film be to be sympathetic with an old hitler plight anyway there be no morally redeem element in the film that say the nazi be bad just that it didn work out the way they want it to recommend see hitler the last ten day or others have like the bunker have not see that one but will someday read alfred speer book inside the third reich also for more true account of what probably happen be this worth seeing of course enjoy it especially because m history buff of hitler and his inner circle and their last day really any of their day and action they undertake be fascinate to me be just disappoint that it really make hitler look like such nice old man when you know he be power mad psycho and be surround by fanatic death squad at his disposal he have recently finish his purge of his enemy plus others m sure from the fail coup of 1944 people be petrify with fear of him remember the story of be hang by piano wire that he film and watch over and over again that moment would have be nice to include here to show how evil he be but no no mention of that my favorite part have more to do with the collapse german army in berlin and what result than on the actual hitler moment we ll see if those who seem to love this film so much find this review offensive because all it be be my opinion of the truth sometimes especially for the political left maybe it be present day nazi who didn like my first review who know do know lot of leftist seem to like this movie whole lot the truth hurt so much they resort to censorship to quell debate hell if press that offensive button on the review find offensive here at imdb it wouldn be very interesting place to visit just use your voter button and let the debate be allow sheesh
no very bad film that must be cancel for be ahead of cat in the hat 2003
great but only for its target audience by tie thousand of balloon to his home 78 year old carl fredricksen set out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wild of south america right after lift off however he learn he isn alone on his journey since russell wilderness explorer 70 year his junior have inadvertently become stowaway on the trip finally get chance to watch the critically acclaim up and here be my thought up be great but only for its target audience which be young kid although pixar have mixed thing around bit this time by introduce an elderly character and briefly approach such theme as life and death loss loneliness and the passing of time the film be clearly child orient sure it be uplifting vibrant and fun and the animation and gci be great but its also crazy unrealistic and ridiculous don think anyone old then 7 8 year old will take this film seriously as kid film think up be tremendous probably delight for any kid and would rate it possibly as 8 or 9 as an overall film its almost disgrace but how could it not be this film shouldn even be compare to regular film because it have very exclusive and limited target audience have yet to be make film that can be fully enjoy by people of all age 5 10
a fine end especially after have see episode iii when it come to create universe george lucas be the undisputed master and his final star war film be very very good and more appropriately rat in comparison to the two previous film in the original saga have recently see revenge of the sith really put this movie in perspective the final battle seem even more climactic know what anakin skywalker go through at the manipulative hand of the emperor it also make the final battle between luke and vader more bitter consider the love he felt for padmé and the love she felt for her child actually while the new film especially episode ii be inferior to the original film they be good for one reason only they make the old film seem even good mark hamill do an exceptional job in this movie he really bring the change luke have go through seem real in all fairness believe that he should have become big actor base on these film because he really do great job harrison ford be still good however you can feel that he have do raider and blade runner in between the two final chapter of star war because he seem to have grow quite bit he add more comedy obviously inspire from raider to the character which work brilliantly in short han solo be well than ever carrie fisher be never really good actress but she do decent job and be certainly passable ian mcdiarmid appear in this film and have see episode iii can safely say that he be one of the most accomplished villain ever james earl jones still provide the voice for vader and he be still very very good in term of how the movie look its pretty safe to say that the star war universe look good than in either of the previous two movie but this be always lucas forté so that be really to be expect the final battle over endor be very well make both in term of the general effect and tension wise it be also nice touch that lucas decide to have three battle take place at the same time as it add to the overall tension of the climax the only thing feel be drag the movie down from an otherwise deserve 9 be the ewoks these little creature be so annoy they almost ruin every scene they be in besides find it to be little to kiddy when group of teddy bear with bow and arrow can defeat squadron of storm trooper with laser gun and mighty machinery all in all return of the jedi be very good movie but the fact that richard marquand be less accomplished director than irvin kershner do that the overall feel of the movie be less than brilliant also george lucas stupid decision to add the ewoks to the universe do that the film fall short of brilliance 8 10
very overrated fellowship of the ring alongside the other two part of the lotr series be very overrated movie it an average movie that only have it special effect to rely on tolkien story of the ring have suffer very poor transfer to the big screen and the fact that the complete result last for about 9 hour be unbelievable nearly fell asleep in the cinema during fellowship of the ring the two tower have little more action to it so at least could keep awake without actually yawn or anything bottomline be don understand why people go so crazy about the lotr movie they re really not that great 2 out of 4 find this helpful
simpson love you but its time ve be simpson fan for long than can remember with the exception of the most recent season have see most of the episode but in my opinion simpson jump the shark year ago and after see this movie my feeling be vindicate the joke be outdated and the character not as funny as they use to be think the moment that the south park movie come out its be all down hill for that show the simpson use to be so funny because it be the most controversial show on tv they go place other show wouldn and couldn i be in packed theater and do not hear one person really laugh heard couple of chuckle but nothing significant know it would be sad to see it go but every show have its time mean all in the family just wouldn work today could they just not dig under the bubble mean come on know it a movie and cartoon and be suppose to just believe but thats just an insult on my intelligence
an epic hubris viewer who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in oliver stone alexander which include exactly two fairly brief battle sequence in its three hour run time the film be not about conquest it be an attempt to create character study of one of history most self contradictory and enigmatic figure the emphasis however should be on the word attempt alexander fails in three basic way in its cast in its refusal to meet certain character issue head on and in directorial decision that easily rank among the most serious misfire in recent memory alexander the great be charismatic self contradictory and enigmatic leader who lead and inspire the large army the world have see up to that point he be battle test kill machine by age sixteen king of macedonia by twenty conqueror of the know world by thirty and above all one of the great military genius of his or any other age colin farrell play the character as weak mind emotionally distraught entity go through the entire film with series of facial expression that would lead to believe he be desperate need of dose of salt it be completely impossible to accept him in the role although val kilmer and angelina jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performance as king philip and queen olympias the remain performance be equally impossible jared leto hephaistion look for all the world like malibu hooker afflict by an eyeliner addiction it be impossible to perceive him as alexander military whip franciso bosch bagoas could be an ancient world version of cher after particularly thick night albeit with good cleavage as for queen roxane history note that she be an unattractive minor tribal princess that alexander find annoy but whom he marry in order to secure military aid from her father the role however be considerably revise and while rosario dawson give it all she have the part play like something out of bondage skin flick during the film theatrical release some audience complain that alexander be portray as homosexual unfortunately you can not offer psychological portrait of alexander without indicate his general indifference to woman and put him in bed with at least two men the general hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave bagoas that be who alexander be that be what the ancient world be like but instead of meet this issue head on the film attempt to indicate the relationship through series of long gaze the occasional caress and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever write for the screen the result relationship read like something off television soap opera that have be cancel halfway into the first season for the sexually insecure there be dvd issue that delete some eight minute of this footage although go with the unedited version and although the scene in question be very badly do can not imagine the deletion of these largely cringe induce scene improve the film to any significant degree largely because virtually everything about the film be no less awkward the script be at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that anthony hopkins be require to provide constant narration something that have the effect of tell us what happen rather than allow us to see it happen but by far the great failing of the script and story line be oliver stone decision to present chunk of the story such as it be out of sequence in essence the first half hour of the film establish the tri fold conflict between king philip queen olympia and the young alexander and run up to major confrontation at this point the film suddenly jump eight year ahead to the invasion of persia and the jump do not read as intentional but as an outrageous unexpected and disastrous flaw in the film approximately two hour later the film present this lost time in the form of flashback but by this point of the scene have be lose and we ve all figure out the detail anyway oliver stone be master of create parallel story line and time line one need look no further than jfk to see his skill it be astonish utterly astonish that he could do no good than this and not be able to do well do not find good way entirely when all be say and do alexander be present as an out of control weakling his psychological motivation be hilariously pat at best and it be utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such large force much less lead it to single victory much less conquer the known world clearly stone be attempt to reach new height in epic cinema but the greek have word for ill advise ambition found on god like arrogance hubris it be sin they believe be never leave unpunished and in this instance the punishment be career cripple if not entirely career kill film as note there be several dvd version include director cut that remove approximately fifteen minute eight of them deal with alexander sexuality bonus include documentary on the making of the film and on composer vangelis who score it as well as an amazingly beside the point commentary by director stone and historian robin lane fox
tired old generic formula yet again movie about lone american man that save the day and kill all the foreign bad guy omg hollywood this again who write this crap see it million time before back in the day it be still cool but now just shameless cliché after cliché no humor virtually no story illogical plot hole action be somewhat enjoyableto my shame must admit enjoyed some of the mindless action scene but the big problem be that it be all to far fetch without any realistic basis it just look stupid denzel isn help either don get me wrong like denzel and credit to him for try but his over act feel out of place he be just try to hard and way to serious in movie you can take serious
this be how you end legacy don 39 know what happen here have such high hope go in they spend 3 4 of the movie set up for 20 minute of action in some tunnel and then it 39 over that 39 it that 39 the grand finish to rambo 39 so disappointed want this movie to be great
science fiction not horror do not match the trailer unfortunately for this film the trailer appear to promise standard formulaic horror film with teenager do stupid occult thing and die horribly for our entertainment people who show up to watch it expect that kind of movie will be very disappointed and likely confuse and bore it be more accurate to say this be gothic lovecraftian psychological thriller mystery it not scary more atmospheric with creepy moment and it would actually fall solidly under the umbrella of science fiction instead of horror damage ex cop stumble upon an ancient scientology esque cult attempt to manifest an inter dimensional be on this plane of existence mind effery on the nature and meaning of reality ensues be my attempt at synopsis you will enjoy this film if you like lovecraft anything mind twisty thing like wonder if reality be real read dark and gritty graphic novel with complicated plot believe it actually base on one noir science fiction you will not like it if you just want horror film the film be largely well do for what it be but unfortunately the people who will enjoy it and the people who will go see it be unlikely to be the same people due to its advertising
flashy fast be it just me or be the movie really really fast blurry and kind of drifted felt as though everything be go so fast couldn breath listen register and sink in the word and thought of the movie and it be surprise how eve from the beginning be so comfortable with each other natalie play eve as though there be no real character choice like it be her portray herself instead of the character the movie make me want to read the book and see for myself and ve read and watch f451 1985 etc and this movie remind me of combination of those book movie these day be so sensationalized and even audience be get tire of it and see past the hype and be laugh at the style
move you deeply the notebook be one of my all time favourite movie its constant and classic love story that make you feel as if you be there watch it as if you be one of the character which make the impact of the story just that much more real there really be no word to describe how this movie make you feel but one thing be for sure it will make you feel after watch it ve often just sit where be and just think about it it just one of those movie that you will think about 30 year after watch it and still get that same feeling in your heart and you ll know that it touch you in one way or another if you haven see it you really be miss out its classic
idiot movie lot of movie in this subject pls not one more it awful we can forget but please stop it idiot movie 1 10 it ridiculous so badd
not that bad and way good of what have expect first of all fanboys have to realize that they re not the intended target audience this be child movie with an appropriate rating make by kid tv network studio the same one that moronically kill it best show of all time over same kiddie issue invader zim it just like the disneyfication of the chronicle of narnia so what be you expect epic blood and gut battle not go to happen specially since these be not orcs or some other type of mystical anthropomorphic animal these be real people indeed the only difference here be that it in an ancient fantasy world setting and that some people have special elemental manipulation power one of the problem of the film be that it fail to create that distinct fantasy realm feel it simply feel too real for it own good would have like to see more funny hybrid like creature animal for create well aesthetic mood that would be the second realization it not cgi action fest either the story be the most important factor it an adventurous coming of age pilgrimage and quest tale sure it could ve be retold well but it be still adequate enough even the special effect of the bending technique be of little consequence since they be so noticeable fake at first glance yet an obv step up from the standard 2d drawing of the series little child love this movie they didn have any issue buying it and hence it be box office success solely because of them so in the same way it make perfect sense to me too third the very premise that the original show have be ransack be flaw it doesn even matter how good or bad it be subjectively perceive to be convert into movie since the bitter truth be that the show really not that great and gradually go down in creative plot quality for each season so this be actually the best main story arc sadly still on another bad aspect of the film be it cast and act aang sokka and zuko be the bad offender besides an iroh that doesn even look remotely similar nor it any fun since this be live action movie the nation within be further characterize with an ethnic tribe correlation the idea be good the implementation wasn keep in mind that this be an usa production it be easy to infer that it have to be caucasianazied after pass the hollywood machinery night try to compromise by add more ethnic variation to the main org asian mix but fail miserably in the end for instance katara and sokka be dark skin in the series here be white d let slide eskimos too but oddly enough it work well for me as norse nevertheless too much artistic freedom be take that wasn require the point be that most people couldn break their preconceived appearance of the character it didn bother me what bother me more be the lack of consistency within their expect behaviour zuko seem to be always angry without reason when it should ve be the opposite ie in the series he come more cool head with clear mind purpose separate by short outburst of near maniacal rage aang look and behaves close enough for the most part the problem rise when he have to utter line and sokka felt here more like secondary character since the movie incidentally emphasize his superfluous effect he should definitely be more funny besides rathbone simply shouldn appear in any movie that require anything but good look anyhow slightly more robust and well act would ve make world of diff for all of them realize this fourth point will help you enjoy the film more since there no chemistry between any of them and the performance for the entire cast be overall flat that also mean that it doesn really emotionally connect with grown up audience albeit that also not problem for me as let it consciously slide but of course that still be no excuse and all fault fall on the writer and director because night simply shouldn have direct it let alone write it it rather self evident that he can not manage other theme that be not twist suspense thriller hell he even hasn score with those one lately only at the beginning of his career this can only mean either that he fall down or he a one trick pony but that doesn mean this be such an gawd awful film it almost enjoyable with the aid of mind alter substance of course which bring me to the fifth issue the nutty plot doesn actually follow the series that closely it obv that it can since it an impossible task to condense appropriately whole season into movie in this particular and series case book 1 thing necessary have to be either change or cut out however surprisingly night passion vision and style counterweight and overcome any problem the film may pose otherwise people that didn like the end product be obv biased towards his work of course the material work best if you haven see the org kid animate series so in resume final more objective cohesive and global look at the film yield that be not that bad as some other comparable adaptation say like the men saga expect realism and serious drama of an unreal campy cartoon be like expect to get drunk out of root beer it ll all end in frustration and disappointment on your behalf so low your expectation and lighten up this obv isn shakespeare and if you want to keep see movie out of those then support them even if not on par to your high and mighty standard of excellence it the only way to boot franchise and eventually get really good reboot way down the line
horrendous not so much ill conceive as poorly implement only give this 2 instead of 1 so that another may attempt bad rendition of this play the whole thing be like 90 slacker meet shakespeare meet typical modern use of little stylistic clip to substitute for proper cinema meet artsy modern garbage particularly loathe ethan performance uninspired pretentious and melodramatic it not that he can act he be great in train day but the material with this format certainly doesn suit the cast in general have load of great people and the script be prove so the director really screw this up lastly bill murray love him but this be not the role for him save your time truly this version be not worth your time
i really don understand why so many bad review really don understand why so many bad review infact find this movie not so bad even nice one funny and entertaining of course be light movie and nothing so special but if you want light comedy with several funny scene and laugh that could be ok
a very depressing and poor end to the series when read most of the other comment felt they be way too glow for this movie find it have completely lose the spark find in the early zatoichi movie and just go to prove that after long absence from the screen it often best to just let thing be completely agree with the star trek analogy from another reviewer who compare the first star trek movie to the original series million of excited fan be wait and wait and wait for the return of the show and be force to watch bland and sterile approximation of the original the plot be at time incomprehensible it be terribly gory though the recent new zatoichi by beat takeshi be much bloody and lack the heart of the original didn mind the blood at all but some may be turn off by it particularly the scene with the sever nose and the severed head in addition time have not be good to ichi he seem broken and sad man in this film much much more than usual and that something fan of the series may not really want to see this be very sorry return for zatoichi unless you be like me and want to see every zatoichi film this one be very skipable see one of the early version or the 2003 all new version
an overlooked classic here an overlooked classic that more than hold its own over five decade after its release two fisted detective charles mcgraw must protect crucial witness marie windsor on train trip from chicago to los angeles since keep secret be hard bad guy who aren so keen on windsor testimony be also on board and will stop at nothing to silence her further complexity be add to an already tense situation when the hit men confuse another passenger as their target the narrow margin be know as b movie but you never know it from watch it true the film isn flashy but it do make the most out of everything it have the story be original and full of twist the suspense terrific and the act memorable with its creative take on what should be simple story and with its colorful character and sharp direction it all more than bit reminiscent of the master himself alfred hitchcock you win regret pick this one up now that it available on dvd
terrible documentary the only reason can imagine someone rating this great than one star would be mistake this documentary for the the science of fast it actually rather surprising that dr fung provide commentary although his portion be well put together and relevant after the first portion it become completely anectdotal and irrelevant comparing intermittent fast with the donner party be that for real there be so many great resource out there regard fast dr fung book the complete guide to fast be one of them this documentary throw out ton of misinformation and felt like an infomercial for various product and youtube channel
a film that must be watch how do golf development that be both deeply oppose by many and flaw by business plan fill with wild guess get build bully power deception and lie this documentary highlight all that be wrong with donald trump when greed wealth and power supersedes the opinion and will of the local people it be astonish to see the appal behaviour of mr trump the scottish government s after watch this if you re scottish you may decide to never vote snp again and the grampian police force this real life story be immensely heartening and portray the very real human emotion and struggle of the local resident involve whilst also expose the extreme bias towards mr trump development by the authority this documentary should be compulsory watch for plan authority politician anyone with an interest in preserve our natural landscapes student go into the construction industry to appreciate the gigantic mistake of mr trump and ensure they be not repeat in the future law enforcement authority to appreciate that there be more side to story than one and to listen and think before take action and all those who seek strong cause to back do hope this film receive the credit it so deserves by some award or another spectacular journalism can be find aplenty and the courage by them and others be commendable the resident be true local hero in this quite literal david and goliath story this be film that evoke all emotion from sadness and anger at mr trump and the scottish government to happiness and joy at see the human spirit in people band together please watch this documentary win go into the detail of it as it would takeaway from the raw feeling you ll feel when watch
top action thriller flick much well than the 1994 remake star baldwin and basinger as always mcqueen be fantastic here as thief doc mccoy who wife have just help him out of prison his screen presence be incredibly strong and as usual he play the the king of cool to tee macgraw as his wife carol turn in solid performance and look ravishingly gorgeous as well and the chemistry between her and mcqueen be palpable it no surprise that they marry after shoot this film even though they barely touch each other save for one or two kiss scene but there noticeable angst and frustration between doc and carol not only because he be in jail for few year but also because doc learns that carol prostitute herself to get him out of jail ultimately of course this husband and wife team of thief just can live without each other the action move along at good pace and the car chase and shoot scene be top notch not fake like other action movie during the time from the bank robbery to the various problem the couple face try to escape to mexico the film be excite and thrill it also bonus hoot to see mcqueen and macgraw two of the big star of the time dump at garbage tip and cover in garbage very good action film
a fun and silly tv show turn into an awful movie let me get this out there straight off the bat love the tv show it be fun and silly and know what it be about know there be lot of expectation when famous and much love tv show be adapt into two hour feature film especially when it be 25 year later but how joe carnahan turn it into to borrow quote from roger ebert an incomprehensible mess ll never know forget the lame script there be much big bone to pick don even know where to start so in no particular order music apart from few chord here and there where the hell be the theme music apart from the credit ba gmc have cameo then get smash to bit cast liam neeson as hannibal great no problem bradley cooper as face great no problem quinten rampage jackson mixed but still think mr could and should have reprise the part sharlto copley as murdoch try very hard to like him but he just didn do it for me when wasn try to figure out who be in what country at any give time be try to make sense of the mess of the script in between all of the non stop action sequence structure be complete mess be try to remember the last time actually sit in movie theatre watch full on action sequence with explosion and the like thinking how bore be and at the end of all of this disrespectful and tacky add on at the end of the credit with dirk benedict and dwight schultz which make absolutely no sense whatsoever it like it be film to maybe go into the main picture at some point but be ultimately tag on at the end mr carnahan just don see the point in involve couple of member from the original tv show just to have use their footage in this way in fact in the ten second that he be on screen dwight schultz do more to show why he be much love as murdoch and as to why the tv show be the hit that it be and as to why it be everything this movie isn something just give me the impression that mr carnahan get to the edit suite and suddenly realise that dwight schultz be so good it show up the crap he have actually make and so relegate it to the post credit sequence all in all really think the filmmaker miss trick here and have make bland and convolute no brainer for 13 year old rather than for the legion of devoted fan that love the tv show so much even after all these year there be something inside me that just think it would have work well to bring back the original cast with liam neeson as hannibal in the place of the deceased george peppard and just update everything to the present day and see what happen to this crack commando team after 20 or 30 year on the run
slow pace nothingness just love it when nearly 2 5 hour run time serve no purpose this movie be so slow even handicap subhuman monkey hybrid could keep up with the story it seem like that be common factor here on imdb good movie always get metascore of 30 100 and imdb rating of 4 7 10 or something like that then a confidential movie you don even have to watch to see it get 90 100 because i a l s m t i g v n c n a c w t o t r w i g n y w d o l truly great movie if you be bit slow or maybe maybe deaf don care about audio that way you can put it play on 2 4x speed and maybe enjoy the ride bit more

need more the king speech be nicely photograph and give us some insight into the period lead up to world war ii but the story be too narrowly focus on its principle subject and could have really benefit from sub plot or diversion to give us some contrast and more historical insight so yeah it be bit boring predicably the movie begin with badly give speech and end with oh sorry guess this might be spoiler here well give speech be this spoiler ha anyone could have predict that so don see how it could be but anyway worth look but pretty much what you get be what you would expect to get don look for any surprise

the bosnian war love story write by markus robinson edit by nicole ashland before begin would like to preface this review by say that be in no way an expert on the bosnian war so before receive any hate mail from angry bosnian or serbian about how be just stupid american who be criticize event that didn live through please realize that be not criticize bosnian or serbian or war tactic or cultural difference my job be to criticize film angelina jolie hate serbians there say it be joke of course she love all race angelina jolie salt receive her first writing and feature film direct credit here in in the land of blood and honey film that be surprisingly almost entirely in serbian and bosnian there have be some controversy at least there be for few month about this actually be an idea jolie stole and call her own but after all be say and do whether or not she come up with the original idea will be the least controversial aspect to arise from this film star zana marjanovic and goran kostic it be not the act which drag this film down it be the storyline jolie choose to focus on instead of straight forward war story chronicle the systematic encampment rape and slaughter of the bosniak bosnian muslim ethnic group during the bosnian war sound like some very compelling and powerful material and in the land of blood and honey would have be compel and powerful if that be what the movie be about instead we get love story set in the bosian war between high rank male bosnian serb soldier kostic name danijel and his female bosniak prisoner marjanovic name ajla and very unsatisfying love story at that in fact the few instance when the story turn its focus from ajla to her sister who have not be capture and be attempt to build resistance against the serb the film become far more interesting and gritty so much so that an argument could be make about how ajla sister would have make more realistic and compelling focus for this full length feature film than ajla herself furthermore without ajla sister subplot in the land of blood and honey be war film that only lightly dabble in the brutality of war for less than third of the movie and then it back to the flimsy love story in the end jolie attempt to address the political brutal and cultural element that make war so complex but spend far far far too much time tell the remedial romeo and juliet love story between danijel and ajla be not against love story by any mean but to have an average love story set during fairly recent war where genocide rape and political cover ups take place the love story aspect tend to take away or dumb down every other important point the film be attempt to make this be kind of like have hardcore love story in schindler list it just doesn work what will undoubtedly anger mass audiences the most because of the way jolie structure her film the tone inevitably do come off as one side in the same way the aforementioned schindler list do which in and of itself isn bad e nazi be horrible people but because in the land of blood and honey be far less developed film the all serbian except for one be inherently ruthless and cruel mentality this film encourage come off as unnaturally skew especially to those like me who be unfamiliar with the in depth event of the bosnian war now be not say that the serb in this film who be show ethnically cleanse mass group of muslim be not horrible people but the way this movie present an entire race the serb as irrational and blood thirsty could be perceive as quite one side and for that reason can see many audience find this the most off put aspect of in the land of blood and honey but then again be not critic of war final thought will give jolie some credit here for manufacture some brilliant shot mostly the war scene that work to show her talent behind camera but much as jolie try it seem as if she know more about the logistics of love story than about create compelling war film not to say that in the land of blood and honey isn a watchable effort and do minimally redeem itself in the final two scene of the film but how this film be nominate for golden globe only prove that the hollywood foreign press will do anything to hang out with big star please visit my page on examiner com http www examiner com 52464 san jose indie movie examiner and leave any comment you have about this or any review the more hit get the good thank you follow me on twitter moviesmarkus

shawshank redeem hollywood can hollywood usually create thing for entertainment purpose only create art to create something of this nature director must approach it in most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process such daunt task require an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their film the most

complete total rubbish the actor be mostly fine although have never like anything paul dano have do but the dialogue be stilted pseudo intellectual absurd claptrap seldom feel so annoyed as this movie make me feel what waste of talent and time it try to manipulate the viewer but there be not one real moment in the whole bloat mess do not understand how it have rating as high as it be of course as small art film it have probably have certain type of self indulgent audience who see what be not there have see film that try for something different off kilter or surprising which be in some way successful meaningful and or entertain this be not one of those film
just okay there be time when the simpson stand for the funny most original comedy on the planet somewhere around season 8 the show pass its prime though and since then it vary from good to okay and sometimes even insipid be hop that for the movie the writer would really push themselves and come up with some really clever and new idea one more time but for all the year of develop that supposedly go into this the movie seem like nothing more than an extended tv episode of latter day simpson have to admit that m not really convince of the concept of put an animated tv series on the big screen in the first place even the south park movie that try to incorporate theatrical element such as the musical number didn really justify the need for cinematic adventure most animated comedy show have very fast paced humor with quick edit this work for an episode of 25 30 minute but in movie with 90 minute run time it would become too exhaust for the audience therefore the whole thing have to be slow down which in return take away lot of the show comedic appeal it a lose lose situation as they say as consequence the simpson movie be unusually slow at time at the same time the storyline be not really stretch to cinematic proportion epic as it may be similar topic have already be deal with in the tv show and good it be say before and it true nothing here try to push any boundary and except for the length of the whole thing and maybe some annoy people in the theater who watch the movie with you you would never realize that this be simpson motion picture other flaw include the fact that some inhabitant of springfield have only very brief cameo mr burn and that some idea have be use in fairly similar way before as entertaining as the movie still may be it be also pretty predictable at time this kind of underachieving as some critic call it may have its own charm but in the end one would have hop for this to be bit more special the movie be by no mean catastrophe but by simpson standard it just not good enough the simpson have become brand people know what to expect and therefore applaud even relatively average movie like this one to rely on that be bit lazy however and one wish that producer put an end to homer adventure as long as we can still remember him and the other beloved inhabitant of springfield as character that completely revolutionize comedy at one point and not as money make merchandise prop

a classic one of the deep most sophisticated nuanced super hero movie ever production quality be amaze the story be complex and long but worth the payoff the acting be great overall the hero be vulnerable in so many way for every ability they have they suffer from even bad flaw this be an alternate universe that fork from historical event rorschach be my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me be an emotional powerful climax thats always gut punch soundtrack be spot on should have win an oscar or at least nomination for any number of category imo genre change idea as profound and well craft as the first matrix by comparison wouldn be surprise if the mcu borrow many idea from this epic have no history with this franchise as graphic novel and can only judge as fan of the movie
my favorite film ever if there no such thing as perfect movie then la la land simply doesn exist there so much right with it that can put into word how much love it but m go to try 1 the opening right out of the gate director damien chazelle let us know what we re watch without doubt it a musical another day of sun be an amazing musical number that show us why people go to los angeles all tell in one shot with no main or secondary character be there it one of the best way film could start and it the best way this could 2 emma stone and ryan gosling this film doesn have too many character but it work it able to tell mia and sebastian story really well with pretty much just them and john legend in the second half and emma and ryan be joy to watch their chemistry be impeccable but see as they ve be in three other film together that not too suprising they both put on amazing performance especially emma in her audition towards the end ryan commitment be astound and it really show they can both sing and dance well something especially highlight in lovely night they re both really fun to watch and their relationship and it problem be believable and they make it even more believable 3 damien chazelle he amaze his style and write feel unique and never bore this be especially show in the film song sequence he make these character relatable and likable from his long take to quick back and forth between character everything he do here make this film look even more beautiful 4 the music and score love it easily the best score for any film ve see yes mean any can put into word just how much love it listen to it again it just amaze epilogue might be my favorite but that not to say literally everything else here isn perfect the only song can think of that isn start fire be intentionally not as good as that the point of the song but d be lie if say didn enjoy that either the music clearly take time and effort and it pay off because without it the film wouldn be nearly as spectacular 5 the epilogue this scene deserve it own category it such gut punch but it so beautiful can not cry from the end while also be sweep away by how beautiful it be the set the score the choreography it all pay off for this ten minute long scene that can possibly get sick of 6 conclusion there something about la la land that can ignore it gorgeous in every way possible there be only one perfect film and this be it encourage everyone read this who hasn to sit down and watch this movie it too good not to see

insipid the pointless film have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film take some do here you have most of the element that would make very good film you have great special effect sci fi conundrum beautiful visuals and good sound yet the most important part of the film be miss there be no plot character or soul to this film it like have beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside it an empty shell of film there be no tension you couldn care less about any of the character why be they even motivate to do what they do help corporation get one over on another corporation be hardly save the human race when you operate in dream environment where you can die or be injure really it mean there be nothing to worry about who care what happen all the explosion and action sequence be just meaningless by the way why do hollywood still keep film action scene an inch away from every character nose it impossible to see what go on so many film be ruin by this watch and learn from the matrix take the camera backwards couple of foot and we can actually work out what go on so 2 and half hour of look at my watch wait for the very predictable end be million mile from be good film how anyone in their right mind can give this 10 10 it bore and pointless film have stir the soul have to grab you you need to feel for the character can anyone honestly say they care about anyone on show here by the way here an idea why don you bring the child who haven age minute since you last saw them to you if you can go to the us know the end scene be try to be ambiguous but the fact his father who live in paris be bizarrely there in the us to meet him how do he know and the child look identical to every dream sequence they appear in mean there wasn much doubt in the end there be nothing at stake for anyone so pointless movie suspect nolan will continue to get praise but can really say ve get excited about any of his movie they all leave me cold they be not terrible just there nothing really there no substance
marvellous end the message of this film be that there be no symmetry to life what go around do not come around the fall of the coin have no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles there be no right or wrong to the fate of men no justice opportunity seize may lead on to fortune but they could just as well lead on to dusty death only child expect thing to be fair as thing once be they need no long be now that imdb have decide to list review by date there be slightly increase possibility that this effort will be read by someone performance review be absolutely not read by me for helpfulness but for interest and entertainment
waste of time there be some film that you just know you re not go to enjoy before even walk into the cinema knight and day be one such film for me in the back of my mind be hop that could be pleasantly surprise but unfortunately it turn out to be as horrendous as first suspect with lacklustre performance from actor past the peak of their career tom cruise and cameron diaz star in this action comedy which fail miserably in both the action and comedy stake cruise have no problem slip back in to the role of secret agent whilst diaz be the stereotypical blonde who become an unwilling partner in his dare exploit although they still have great screen presence and definite chemistry tom and cameron have reach new low with knight and day its only appeal be the reunion of the two actor who must have lack of good script be offer their way bill as summer blockbuster knight and day can not even be compare to other recent successful blockbuster such as toy story 3 and inception and doesn even come close to the duff remake of the karate kid if any other actor be in the main role this would be complete failure at the box office and film destine for the bargain bin the action scene be predictable and grossly unrealistic for those daft enough to pay the ask price prepare yourself for ridiculous bike chase amongst the running of the bull stay away from this awful film even though it be preview screening and my ticket be free be annoy at lose two hour of my life tom cruise and cameron diaz need to realise that their day as respected celebrity will be number if their attempt to replicate the early success of their career continue knight and day could possibly be the bad film of the year so far although do have ticket for step up 3 and the last airbender so this could soon change
what joke that this movie could be 1 on imdb list only show that there be major problem with how that list be generate dislike critic as much as anyone but there need to be some safeguard against drove of mindless fan exult movie that have little more go for it than hype and special effect to be fair the acting be very good but can say more for it because the utter lack of character development in the film ruin any chance for great performance others have already point out how cliche most of the scenario and action be and how long the film drag on for so ll just mention my major complaint the complete lack of continuity in any respect perfect microcosm be the horse chase where arwen be at one moment surround by the dark rider who seem to ride at twice her speed to catch up while in the next cut she have somehow open up thirty foot lead pretty typical of bad action movie but not of the best movie of all time poor portrayal action be only minor complaint but continuity be lack on much grander scale in this film character just don have any consistent quality be sam really very close to frodo or be that just how hobbit be how could the great gandalf have be so mistaken about his mentor the group decision while trek through middle earth be asinine they be halfway across mountain range and then decide to head back and go through hellish cavern where they be sure to die all this because frodo give the ok but who would expect reason from group that decide to bring along three extra bumble fool as if defeat the supreme evil power wasn challenge enough could go on and on but this movie isn worth the webspace just hope that in the end people see some reason and give it the 3 or 4 out of 10 it deserve
painfully bland and as exciting as watch paint dry start watch it because of its reputation and its cast switch it off after half an hour and watch john wayne war movie instead because very little happen in the king speech the dialog at best be tepid and the background music be awful like other reviewer have notice there a lack of colour it as if the budget allow the set and costume designer to use only blue black and brown with sprinkling of white and like other reviewer have comment the performance be disappoint get the impression that whoever approve the production of this film think that because downton abbey be hit anything that be about the british aristocracy or monarchy would be one as well it didn work with me though get bore with da and stop watch during its third season similarly stop watch the king speech for the same reason how this movie manage to win the best picture oscar be mystery to me
sure to ruffle some politically correct feather but important for its historical value be very happy that warner brother video have release this film although it very politically incorrect when see through today lens it be very important historical document plus it show side of black american culture you just don see otherwise fortunately instead of bury the film and pretend it doesn exist like disney have do with song of the south they add brief prologue that explain the context for the film and apologize for ruffle some politically correct people the wrong way as history teacher be thrill that they do release this oscar nominate film especially since they show side of black culture from the era apart from the famed harlem renaissance in new york the first 30 minute or so have little actual plot the film be set in the deep south and the people be all very poor black farmer and be tell in the colloquial term of the day for such folk some might ruffle especially as some of the portrayal seem bit over the top but it also feature wonderful black spiritual dance and culture albeit sanitize and reshape by hollywood for general consumption after the first half hour the plot begin zekial be flush with money after sell his cotton crop crafty and evil woman pretend to care about him but actually set him to lose the money in rig crap game zekial realize what happen and open fire and accidentally hit an innocent person he disappear and be not see for some time when he do return he now preacher his life supposedly change and reinvent what will this preacher do however when he one day meet up with the same lady and the slick gambler who rob him and set his life on this new course watch and see for yourself whether or not you see this film should all depend if you be dye in the wool politically correct person you should avoid it or at least have few drink first to calm your nerve if you be history teacher or film historian definitely watch it if you be casual viewer want some fun well this be not the most funnest film you can find it be definitely challenging viewing and very dated and yes know you don say most funnest thank you regardless for its time it be actually pretty liberal and quite positive step for the white power structure that the film be make even if it still fall way short when see today by the way for sound film from 1929 it have amazingly good sound and the print quality be excellent it appear to have be very well restore something that can be say of many film of this era
amaze feel good movie it quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy genuine movie blend comedy and drama with such naturalness that why intouchables be undoubtedly rare authentic picture and the fact that the story be inspire by true one help make the movie more involve funny and touch at the same time the picture evolve with simplicity but strong pathos with the merit of avoid every pathetic or melodramatic attitude there brutal honesty in represent the real condition of philippe as well as driss initial uncompassionate attitude there be touch moment there be true amusing moment both accompany by forceful soundtrack act prof brilliant to say the least and the pairing between francois cluzet and omar sy sparkle and capture the viewer attention be sweep away by dryss genuine smile as well as by philippe melancholic eye and the moment when they be together fill me with an authentic feeling good sentiment definitely must see picture

anderson have deliver the best picture of the year with his oil epic but after watch the coen brother chill and violent adaptation of cormac mccarthy 2005 novel know right away that here be film destine to be even great film than any ve see this past year it not easy to watch no country for old men the first time saw it find myself daze enough to not be able to stand up immediately even after the whole end credit have finish and yet mixed with the feeling of shock be the profound sense of wonder and awe with what have just witness on the screen it take me another view to fully appreciate the meaning and intention of the film and while the experience from watch the film be not one everybody will enjoy and understand it certainly be one of the most moving and think provoke movie have ever watch this be the kind of movie that will make you think the kind that stay with you even after long time have pass since you ve last watch it on the literal level it be simple cat and mouse chase thriller movie but from within its root lie very profound philosophical and penetrate analysis not only of the character and the situation involve in the story but also of the kind of world we be live in today and the more monstrous side of it we often choose to ignore the story revolve around the chase between guy name llewelyn moss josh brolin who stumble upon stash of money in drug deal go wrong in the middle of the desert and psychopathic but surprisingly principled assassin name anton chigurh javier bardem the third party and the moral center of the story be the guy try to find both the hunter and the hunted ed tom bell the old sheriff of peaceful but increasingly become violent locality in west texas the movie feature the perfect mix thrill and excitement that would be expect out of movie in this genre the coen brother direction of the particularly intense chase scene between chigurh and moss be masterful evoke emotion of suspense to the high level and push the audience to the very edge of their seat this be achieve by very careful editing and sound direction that perfectly recreate the tense atmosphere whenever particular scene be be play out also remarkable be the photography do by roger deakins of vast scene in the desert where even what the ordinary moviegoer would consider as empty scene where no action be play out tell story in visual manner where even when there be no dialogue or action on screen the sweeping image speak out for themselves no country for old men be rich in such bravura kind of film make the particular camera move position and choice of background and other trivial detail such as time of day cloud cover or positioning of the prop and point of view perspective offer the best experience for the audience and the most effective mean of story tell for the coen brother just watch the scene of tommy lee jones as the tormented old sheriff be burden by the challenge of something that be great force than himself something that he do not understand and you will realize what mean the environment and tone create by the filmmaker perfectly accentuate the performance of jones and more importantly the core message of the film this style be present throughout the film and one of the particular point that make it more than just chase movie must say that can help but agree to most people when they say the javier bardem anton chigurh be the most disturbing character and yet mesmerize to grace the screen since anthony hopkins introduce us to hannibal lecter in silence of the lambs chigurh effectively radiate evil and embodies violence in very intelligent and forceful manner that touch the fear in all of us like lecter he personify evil not in the conventional and simple sense but in way that somehow present to us the whole magnitude and complexity of its nature in the dialogue he speak kind of thinking reveal be one that be calculate and deeply philosophical but essentially ruthless and sinister

us in manner where we after the whole experience can reflect upon and look back with careful consideration in the end the moviegoer be leave to marvel at the beauty and madness of it all here the theme of innocence lose as it be corrupt by evil and violence be explore in the most cinematic fashion deliver perfectly with richness of emotion and the great impact possible the violence and bleakness of it all be not there to simply evoke reaction or engage the audience it be there to tell story and impart an experience of great magnitude and intention to which the coen brother have brilliantly succeed all at the same time the movie be character study on the effect of evil and innocence lose an exploration on the theme of fate and chance an analysis of the freedom to choose and its consequence reflection on evil and good as force of society and the investigation of basic human emotion such as hope fear love violence and aspiration in the face of variety of situation

poor in almost every possible way yesterday watch the movie interstellar poorly script and poorly direct movie with an over simplified pseudo science and spoon fed philosophical implication basically typically overrate hollywood movie which take no shame in copy from 2001 space odyssey from kubrick with none of its beauty simplicity and none of its art it show that in 1968 they be able to make masterpiece and in 2014 they can even copy it decently the fact that on imdb it have an high rating than the kubrick masterpiece make me lose all faith in the progress of humanity and in our current generation will watch 2001 space odyssey again to forget about it and restore faith in human kind again
i not say only woman should write rom coms but accord to the credit 4 men be responsible for this story and one of them team with another guy to write the script add in the director and at least 6 dude have hand in craft this very female centric film how do you think that work out there be plenty of example of one man with singular vision write great story about woman even two fellow combine their talent to spin yarn about the fairer sex be somewhat common but when 12 testicle try to create romantic comedy with half dozen significant female character and lead man who barely more than eye candy the result have all the tenderness of an assembly line and as much charm as baseball player scratch his crotch you can forgive the conceit that monica potter be play an average woman who move in with 4 fashion model mean this be hollywood so standout beauty like potter be as close to average as their tiny brain can come you can even forgive the model be play as the sympathetic cheering section for potter character even though they re portray as stupid shallow and materialistic though inappropriate for their role that far more personality than best friend character usually get in rom coms what you can forgive be how head over heel be clearly break up into three section that be practically different genre it start out with 30 minute that include almost every rom com cliché include the woman walk in on her cheat boyfriend makeover musical montage and romantic misunderstanding that segue into half hour parody of woman in peril flick though somewhat in reverse here the woman see the guy kill someone and then fall in love with him everything wrap up with 30 minute of action comedy involve international smuggling fisticuffs at fashion show and cunnilingus sight gag not brief one either the bit go on for the good part of 30 second in pg 13 film that must have be proud day for the motion picture rating board amanda monica potter be an art restorer with terrible judgment about men when she catch her late boyfriend cheat on her she need new place to stay and get take in by 4 model shalom harlow ivana milicevic sarah hare and tomiko fraser amanda be weak kneed at the sight of handsome stranger freddie prinze jr who turn out to live in the building across the way his apartment position just so amanda can see in his window any time she want at first she think he a dreamboat then amanda remembers her awful luck with guy and look for flaw he turn out to really be dreamboat then amanda see him beat some girl to death with baseball bat her horror at that last less than 10 minute and she back moon over him only to eventually discover he have big secret just not any one she suspect the bottom line on head over heel be that it badly write in exactly the way you expect when 5 or 6 chap each stick their paw into romantic comedy stew here a good example of what mean amanda spend virtually all of the film in the company of the 4 model they be her support system her humorous foil and plot device upon which lot of the movie depend except when amanda be introduce to the audience she already have best friend at her art restoration job friend which be then dispense with so amanda and the model can team up her original best friend be absent for at least 90 of the film and bring back at the end for couple of joke so why be the original best friend keep in the script it the same reason why the story shift through three different genre with so many separate creative voice especially male one single narrative vision could never emerge monica potter be adorable freddie prinze jr be generically handsome and head over heel at least make consistent attempt at be funny lot of those attempt be old hat and some be oddly crude but few laugh make it through yes the character be all moron and you don actually care what happen to them reasonably appeal star and an honest effort to entertain can sometimes be enough however and that might have be true here the tripartite fiasco of the plot be what ultimately doom this motion picture this isn as annoy as most bad rom coms that not enough to make it worth anyone time

not good rambo movie but sweet score the rambo franchise hasn 39 be know for its subtlety and that be prove when sylvestre stallone return to the role back in 2008 the amount of violence throughout that film give action junky everything they be ask for it also take the outrageously bloody aspect of the franchise to another level as well wrap up in nice bow by the time the credit roll 2008s rambo seem to be the finale well apparently not as rambo last blood be now in theatre sadly this franchise definitely should have end with the previous instalment here 39 why believe this movie simply doesn 39 work br br now retire and take care of ranch out in the county john rambo have evolve into seemingly much calm man after his niece make poor decision to find out the truth of who her real father have become out in mexico all hell break loose as john find himself on the hunt to save his family without ruin anything one thing lead to another and he eventually need to use his home as giant war zone booby trap to fend off his enemy in theory this premise be great set up for an action film that simply want to focus on the action itself but it really doesn 39 feel anything like rambo movie br br be war veteran and fend off his enemy throughout the course of his entire life john rambo be character with lot of complexity for this reason alone many of the rambo film have be able to tell interesting story even if the execution wasn 39 always there this time around he have become family man and an emotional tie be what get him back in the game the finale of this movie be the only remotely entertaining aspect but the set up for it just felt like an excuse for revenge movie which be never truly what the rambo film have be br br stallone be commit to this character as always and yvette monreal as his niece be actually quite good but their dynamic just felt like it belong in another movie with the addition of some very cheesy dialogue at time and the fact that john rambo be the only one who feel like real flesh out character find myself not really care about what happen to anyone here that say audience who watch rambo movie be usually there for the action anyways and if you 39 re fan of gory violence that 39 do well then the final 20 minute may be enough for you br br in the end rambo last blood be mixture of element from movie like take and home alone with an elderly war hero at the forefront and the violence crank up to thousand there be moment of enjoyment and even few time where be have little fun but it really be an emotional movie that doesn 39 feel earn it ask you to care about character that haven 39 be around for much of the franchise and just couldn 39 buy it for die hard fan of the franchise maybe check it out once it 39 available to rent or buy at home but really don 39 think it 39 worth your time
a disservice to important history this film use every cliché in the book start with the liberal mind white person who be the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people this film be emotionally manipulative and pander to sentimental reduction of complex history its move be predictable and use every trick in the book even the scene in the church be cliché both the white and the black character be mostly reductive caricature out of some story book world which doesn do justice to the historical complexity of such situation why would you want to make saccharine comic book out of profound historical situation other than to pander to audience long for feel good experience for the sake of box office actually don mean to disrespect to people who like it and don want to attack the actor they didn write the film but at the same time can believe that so many people fell for this bag of trick still big problem and disservice movie like this do to our culture be that such bad history and simplistic human portrayal turn race dynamic into good guy bad guy story which we can watch with complacent feeling of how much good we be than those bad old day such complacency lead to historical ignorance that retard honest critique and real progress this movie would be good if it just didn pretend to be about something let it be some sappy comic book that wouldn be the bad thing in the world at least it would be more honest
waste of time honest review this be the bad movie ve see this year not worth even one star
it pretty bad it go one of two way for the actor in this movie either they overact so hard it painful or they just don bother act at all mgk be terrible but you can tell he can play the drum and the way it present be somehow different from other bad boy rock roll guy biopics ve see before it just feel like collection of stuff that happen to some guy in the 80 i get the feeling you could mix up most of the scene and put them wherever you want and it would work out about the same would have give it about two star but the early rehearsal and show scene seem pretty real lot of time in these kind of movie the guy all meet each other and play together and it sound perfect right away they try to make it sound and feel like real band just get their music together overall d rather watch the vh1 behind the music
the rich get rich and the poor get evict ain we get fun don know how adam mckay make deplorable human blind fear gut boil outrage and gleeful sham so much fun to watch he bring along his bag laffs but plant them in such rich soil so we have to hack our way through the thick underbrush of tainted greenback and mark deck everyone in top form didn recognize brad pitt for awhile ryan gosling funny christian bale let us feel his pain and lonely genius steve carell dug deep and come up with real mensch nice to see marisa tomei hamish linklater john magaro rafe spall finn wittrock max greenfield and talented others work at solid level walk out of the westwood bruin theater in awe and mad as hell
ahead of its time still can believe this come out in 1982 it look like it be make lot later with good technology mean 1982 have some real old lookin stinker and t be so ahead of it time back when spielberg be in his prime remember see this at the theater multiple time and be bear in december of 1977 so couldn have be any old than 4 be watch it with my two girl as type this they be age 10 and 8 and they be absolutely mesmerize lol also d like to point out the great act especially by henry thomas elliot if you ever get chance to look on youtube look up his original audition for this movie it ll blow you away anyway t be timeless classic not to ever be forget the people rating it 1 who be say it be bore need to stick with their transformer movie lol
slow burn come of age comedy this movie be slow burn but the point that it be try to make come across as someone who grow up catholic knew exactly what she be go through and how catholic guilt can get you when you be try to figure out who you be as person and it suck natalie portray that very well and how we all try to hide who we be or we will be strike down by god one of my only gripe be that it be little slow at time but love the main character story of embrace who you be
repetitive boring mad max barely do anything in it to be honest go into watch this film with negative mind anyway as have hear that it be just crazy people drive round desert they be not wrong it be terrible tom hardy just grunt most of the time and it be call mad max but it be barely about him he doesn do much in it it be just people drive through the desert with unexplained thing happen in it and then when finally have feeling of relief because think the film have end it hadn they pick up some old lady and turn back round and go down the same way they just come from to have very similar fight in the same place with the same people except the old lady they pick up die so it just pointless but rubbish fight all the way through with big car lot of fire and no good story this be typical boy film normally love action film with car and fight but this be just repetitive and bore it didn excite me make me laugh shock me or make me want to know what be go to happen next waste of two hour of my life
one of my bad ever film happen to watch this film by accident with friend and both of us be soon deeply embarrass to be sit in the cinema with people who actually enjoy this the humour be totally obnoxious and the value be somehow all wrong also saw the version with jerry lewis and don think the two film be alike in the way they use humour if jerry lewis bear any resemblance to another living actor than maybe to jim carrey for example in me myself and irene but never to eddie murphy
love improbably iris kate winslett attractive if somewhat dowdy young english journalist she work for that citadel of fogeyism the daily telegraph on the rebound from an affair with the shiftless jasper rufus sewell one of the paper columnists decide she need christmas holiday she go on line and have soon swap her christmas card pretty but cramp surrey cottage with mansion in bel air own by amanda cameron dias the ebullient head of company that make movie trailer who have just throw out her late useless partner the girl swap place and in no time amanda be romance iris dishy brother graham jude law meanwhile in hollywood iris be get to know mile jack black workmate of amanda and 90 year old neighbour arthur eli wallach who happen to be one of hollywood forget great writer one can of course dismiss this sort of stuff as glossy fairy floss because basically despite all the money and talent expend in make it that be what it be love improbable this film be rather long for its genre over two hour and it do drag bit as if the scriptwriter couldn decide how to end it however it must be admit that kate winslett and jude law be always interest to watch on screen and cameron diaz have nice line in parody some of her early performance rufus sewell show he can out act hugh grant any day not hard guess jack black on the other hand seem strangely out of place as m s love interest romantic comedy doesn seem to be his forte he more of your gross out guy it be nice though to see eli wallach great hollywood tough guy of old who at 90 seem to have the market for nice old buffer sew up as the neighbour perhaps be set my standard too high but compare to four wedding and funeral notting hill bedroom and hallway and even love actually this be pile of mush far too sweet and sticky and nice good comedy need certain bite reality bite bit of astringency whereas what we be give here be pure fairyland escapism writer director nancy myers have record of light entertain stuff the parent trap father of the bride and she certainly be not try to extend her range here
crap with capital warn warn warn warn the review contain spoiler the review contain spoiler the review contain spoiler the review contain spoiler this review contain spoiler right from the begin completely morbid and joyless film grim and hopeless to the point to depravity the ignominious death fashion for charles xavier be unworthy give the legacy of this character equally distasteful be the not so subtle suggestion that this film or its character be comparable to shane this self service association be entirely unearned and border on heresy you could have do so much good with modicum of imagination and heart when saw the come attraction it leave me feel miserable though who would possible want to see such grim and hopeless film as an owner of copy of the previous two film and most men movie go to see it anyway leave the theater feel even bad than do after view the come attraction the rating of 3 out of 10 rather than 2 out of 10 be for the visceral depiction of the effect of professor s brainstorm that part be very well do aside from that thanks for nothing guy eat soup and cough
great act an unbelievable find on the brink of war look into the ancient history of britain but the movie be really about the life of the normal people who discover it secrets great act from the main character especially fiennes show us how versatile he really be great watch
this movie reach all time low in the awful cheesy kung fu movie genre laugh so hard watch this movie nearly kill myself it be so unbelievably bad and so completely unaware of how bad it be that you can help star in shocked disbelief the dialogue be horrible the act suck save for pretty ok performance by monroe and the directing be textbook of cheesy bad timing but what really make the film worth watching be the action sequence these little cut rate gem rival even the bad overseas badly dub monstrosity examples guy dy from gunshot wound to the shoulder people jump off wall and fly 20 foot in the air every time somebody turn quickly or reach for something you get the ever popular whoosh sound effect this movie be horrible but it a great late night choice if you want to see just how bad bad film making can be
make you think this be french film in that nothing happen for 2 5 hour but it make you think it film in english but the fact that it have french director probably account for the style the film be ultimately about happenstance the choice we make and what they could lead too there be element in there about string theory the beginning and end of the universe and therefore quantum mechanic however rather than occur at the particular level the event and interaction make up the film and possibility take place between human being rather than the few outcome that could possibly occur from the entanglement of electron or proton at the subatomic level this film deal with the truly infinite outcome of what might be there be some mention of life before birth and life after death but this be only touched upon and not explain in any fashion there be also some scene which appear to involve time travel or something similar think these element didn add much too the film yet didn detract from them either their presence be mildly confusing or perhaps irritate but probably add just little bit more of the unknown into the whirl mass of possibility in life that mr nobody attempt to present like this film and will probably watch it again sometime 8 10
just leave it after you ve see the trailer can be short on this one just leave it after you ve see the trailer it doesn get good than that have no idea why scarlett johansson take this role or why they even pursuit in make this into full lengt movie get sci fi get art movie and even weird movie but this what be this and most of all why
eastwood try and fails to be politically correct it be well when he wasn try it a helluva thing kill man you take away all he have and all he gon na have say that with as if you re cecil demille recite from the book of genesis and as slowly as possible and you ll have some idea of what unforgiven feel like it one self important speech after another as eastwood try to atone for the sin of much good film like pale rider it all start when prostitute be violently beat by client he have comically small penis and she laugh at it yes that really be what happen it not only implausible it a forced genuflection towards feminism and just the first in long line of forced genuflection anyway the prostitute be unable to exact legal revenge on the man so they offer bounty to anyone who will kill him and his friend who have do no wrong and who more importantly the prostitute have no particular reason to even dislike word get around the country swarm with would be assassin and eventually the men be kill by an age clint eastwood character except that he kill them in way that demonstrate the futility of violence or some such on the way we meet variety of unpleasant character who walk onto centre stage and then walk off to pad thing out ll be honest loathe western as rule but m not incapable of recognise good story that for some reason or other can be appropriately set in 19th century america this bloat movie if it about anything at all be about other western look it cry other western glorify violence other western be ignore the role of black other western don admit that prostitute be mistreat at least other western be film in their own right
watchable but overrate also too long the film be watchable and some part be impressive but overall don think it live up to the hype the special effect be top but too much of it be already show in promotion trailer or clip the acting be not very believable it seem bit ott especially jack black my view of the film could be skew by the fact that there be lot of noise in the cinema by some young unruly child who decide to talk all the way through the movie and cause general annoyance also the film be way too long some scene be not necessary the film could have do with good edit it seem peter jackson be little over indulgent however it would be unfair to say this film be bad it have some great action especially with the dinosaur chase the best part of the film be on the jungle island
what be art if not prompt for debate the impact of under the skin be substantially reduce by the information that some reviewer and preview blurb for that matter decide to impart to the potential viewer watch the trailer by all mean but be careful what you read before you view jonathan glazer weird disturbing film don even read the solitary line of blurb on the imdb page and that a unique criticism of the great site from me strange than glazer birth less accessible than his fantastic sexy beast under the skin be visually and tonally disturb voyeuristic journey that follow an odd emotionally detach woman laura scarlett johansson as she pick up stranger in her van on the street of scotland laura dismiss more than she pick up as she clearly have reason and personal need for them much have be make of johansson performance and the largely improvised interaction with non actor certainly this be fine departure from the norm for her she be compel convince and chill but rather too much have be make of the improvisation imply that under the skin rely almost entirely on random connection with passersby however that be just one aspect of the film and it would neither succeed nor disturb without script and performance from actor or at least heavily direct first timer there be some fine moment of public reaction to the abnormal laura but find myself want more that be undeniably unrehearsed and shock to the scottish resident who stumble across laura on the street the debate will rage over whether under the skin be mind expand art or pretentious p and veer towards the latter with some reservation there be plenty of visual delight range from use of colour blend the combination of film and the stunning set and effect of laura what shall we call it lair that will suffice the slick dark pool of the interior be perfectly at odds with the derelict exterior and the contrast of laura bleak world with the rugged scottish scenery and the depressed council estates enhance our discomfort the support actor paul brannigan the angel share sunshine on leith the most recognizable amongst them be here purely to serve johansson and their character fodder for laura need we be give the bare snippet of information about them just as much as laura require to make her decision on whether they be prospect worth pursue under the skin be not film particularly enjoy nor wish to see again in hurry mica levi disquiet score ramp up the violin to scratch under the um skin to maximize the unnerving effect of the visuals and plot such as it be it be bleak disturb unsettling and not easy view but it be also imaginative beautifully creative and if nothing else will prompt debate as to its merit and what be art if not cause of discussion for more review from the squiss subscribe to my blog and like the facebook page
well my wife like it my wife love this film she think this relationship movie be great found it ok the first time but second time its more soap operish they do this big dance at the end of the summer for bunch of camper after both lead character live becomes mess big deal the movie seem hopeless and pointless might be wrong but this movie will not age well
the critic where wrong about the song in 1975 and they be wrong about the movie in 2018 this movie be must see for any music and movie lover queen fan or no queen fan anyone who see this movie will be go through rollercoaster of emotion beeing it queen music or the story behind the music ramus malek put down an excellent version of freddie mercury but all the actor play great in this movie in my opinion best thing to do be ignore the criticism and go see it for yourself
a popular film that deserve its popularity if you like hopeful surprising never see before character you will enjoy this amuse story of family of prisoner victimize by the system and bible thumping pig robbins and freeman and everybody else give perfect performance for their character their action and body language be perfect for this story and movie 9
suppose classic be actually rather dull be not alive in the seventy to see this movie the first time around in 2002 when do finally first watch part of it on video felt myself become more and more depressed about the world the setting of the film the pace the seemingly directionless progression of event all seem to leave bitter stale taste in my mouth it be in way fascinating to see al pacino at much young age than the movie have always see him in and the dynamic of the crowd jeering during his scene outside bring some energy to the film that begin to interest me but turn it off somewhere near three quarter of the way through the film because frankly it didn entertain me enough still believe in al pacino as great actor but dog day afternoon leave me feel as though have waste my time my advice would be that you don waste yours on it despite rave review of so many self important critic of the classic of movie
a waste of two great actor have no idea why everyone love this movie so much found it underwhelming and m not just talk about the camera work either that the least of this movie problem everything be just way too schizophrenic character and reference to character just pop out of absolutely nowhere only to then be drop like bad habit only minute later as such the viewer be give nothing to work with in term of dramatic tension suspense or well execute action the comedy always feels force because there no setup time for any of the scenario they do this then they immediately do something completely different then they instantly do something else etc ad infinitum the script can be summarize as follow bunch of stuff happen very little of which be interest or fun it try to be stylish but come off as simply cheap and no it not funny at all this movie be the posterchild for underdeveloped concept virtually everything here be wafer thin as expect when you throw in dozen of superficial element that be give few minute of screen time each the structure and light speed cadence be so irritating that it grate on the nerve within the opening 5 minute someone should have give the director some depressant and take away the cameraman red bull this be huge disappointment and waste of two great actor
not too good not too bad can say like or dislike the crow the acting be good but the story didn appeal to me suppose the vendetta theme have be do so much that have become tired of it also sometimes it seem the plot be hard to follow it could have be well movie but it be just to simplistic
bloody and violent old school action flick ok so have to admit can 39 help but love sly stallone the guy just keep come back succesfully against all odds who would have think that he could pull off another rambo flick at age 73 well 39 glad he do because besides liam neeson denzel washington and mel gibson who be we gon na turn to for some old school old man on revenge spree flick br br be big fan of first blood but didn 39 care so much for the second too cartoonish and third too friggin 39 awful installment the fourth however be just amazing slow build up suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence that last action sequence where rambo go totally berserk and make mince meat out of whole army mean come on that be awesome br br the fifth rambo be little different in that it be more of generic revenge flick in its setup but only in its setup though as soon as rambo start maim and kill this movie go so far over the top you can 39 help but cheer him on this be one bloody movie last blood it may be but it be many full bucket of it br br also like how rambo be more vulnarable in this flick stallone get to use more of his act chop in this one br br know it 39 a lot to ask and maybe shouldn 39 even hope for it but damn it sure would like another one of these
a familiar journey to the unknown albeit grand one so last night get the chance to see the early screening of christopher nolan interstellar the film ve be wait so much from the early day of the shoot how do it fare here my take to avoid any tl dr risk let me get this straight from the very begin interstellar be one goddamnedly good film it get you to the edge of your seat it soar it warp it rip your brain senseless it that good interstellar be story about the earth die with its soil no longer able to sustain crop other than corn and of course it will lead to the extinction of humanity our hero be an ex nasa test pilot name cooper matthew mcconaughey typical ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation everyman who also dedicate family man especially toward his daughter murphy name after the murphy law in an all too armageddon style our hero get invite by the publicly defunct nasa to become humanity last hope in find new home for they have find wormhole near saturn 2001 anyone which will warp the astronaut to another galaxy in quest of habitable planet solid and compact premise although it be use before for seasoned filmgoers there be many similar element although it understandable with stanley kubrick 2001 space odyssey 1968 and robert zemeckis contact 1997 in sense that this be not bang bang shoot shoot blow em up sci fi but more of slow burn metaphysical sci fi which get you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time similarity with 2001 and contact be never bad thing but it become wee bit too predictable although nolan be smart enough director in provide the final very sentimental one should say twist in the story the visuals in this film be majestic everything be shoot to meticulously calculated level nolan style the space scene be serenely suspenseful just like cuaron gravity but unlike the documentary feel of gravity there a real gusto and pace to these scene you should also be prepare for the for some maybe unexpected third act it be nolan most sentimental and humane moment to date and this be why interstellar be more than just science fiction it be human drama intertwine in space and time loop one thing that nolan get bit wrong be the narrative nolan be never warm director his film be fill with brilliant idea and flair but it feel cold it maybe suit memento and the dark knight but in interstellar he seem to have be lose in determine which of the interpersonal drama or the sci fi that will be interstellar forte the result be rather incongruous script intermittently cut off the excitement of the previous scene and so on but it be forgivable sin for the good be lot more than the bad in this monumental film at the end of the day all can say be that interstellar be grand film it be monolithic thoughtful sentimental sophisticated visceral but also with its flaw wouldn say it nolan best work to date but daresay that this be one of the best science fiction ever release after watch interstellar do yourself favor and get lose in space and time and go back in time to see contact 1997 and 2001 space odyssey 1968 to further wonder and wander into the realm of the unknown because sometimes it be the unknown that fascinate us frighten us and bring out the best in us
a bit underwhelming really never have see this film it be always on my to see list give the high accolade it receive have decide to watch it on my own due to so call disturb scene sit down today to enjoy the film the opening scene be the best the stare alex give the camera as it pan out be classic image one which promise much mayhem and extreme behaviour from the lead character unfortunately never quite get what be look for be hop to be shock and leave with some kind of feeling after the film but all be leave with be be that it there be element enjoy namely the music score which remind me of the music from the warrior in an early synth kind of way also enjoy the glee with which malcolm mcdowell sing sing in the rain while punctuate the part of the song by slap and kick his victim but it isn as menacing as it sound be always well aware be watch actor and never for moment become absorbed into any of the character however think it be mean to be receive in this way to add to the dystopian society that doesn care message which get but that just doesn make for very enjoyable film thats why would recommend people to read the book if you re look to become absorbed in the character and the true meaning of the story can understand how in 1971 this be consider very disturbing film but do not judge it by today standard else you will be underwhelmed
fun when you re young be highly impressed with this picture when be young but when recently saw it yet another time there a lot wrong with it the big problem be that the story doesn continuously move it one coincidental meeting after another it very fragmentaric so you don really feel that you re into the movie the acting by young hathaway isn too convince either and the effect be so and so at best but these be all problem you can live with when you be young suppose great movie to show your kid but if you keep fond memory of it from when you be young leave it where it be as you might feel disappointed afterwards 6 10
dirty be very apropriate m not sure ll ever understand why such vapid inane and formulaic movie get so popular understand it have something to do with immature female who think this be quality romance the dry sex to music be just annoy and the lead character be name johnny castle for real movie with real romance watch casablanca
i think might be the minority on this one don feel like the movie live up to the hype m really stoke to hear that many think it be good want nothing more than to see one of my favorite show of all time be successful if you be true simpson fan this movie leave lot to be desire there be few moment that be pretty awesome spiderpig genius but what the hell happen to him he just disappear the key secondary character that have round the show out over the year be nearly non existent hardly any skinner moe barney ralph milhouse etc why weren they more involve the plot and storyline be pretty random didn make sense and for lack of good word be eh the president should have be mcbain could have fit with the show little good one of the main character in the movie the dude that have hank scorpios voice secretary of state maybe be never feature in the show just feel like they should have stick to the plot line that bring them to the success of season 2 9ish maybe bring back conan
what disappointment somehow manage to be even more unrealistic and cheesy than the first film it have some funny joke and the cgi be amazing but do it really make good movie
men with big hat confess have not see much of the series but the bit have see do not lead me to watch it it have the flavour of dallas about it as for some call it western apart from men in big hat it be nothing like real western then dallas be nothing to do with oil hope the actual west be nothing like this
the film while lovely to view departs dramatically from austen novel while the new pride prejudice film be gorgeous to view and the soundtrack be lovely we be not see jane austen pride and prejudice the film be for some reason set back in the early 1790 rather than the regency period where the novel be set as scholar have long show the bennet longbourn estate be ram shackled and look like cold comfort farm yet the bennet in the novel be gentry class they own farm but the pig do not walk through the house nor be the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home scene be re set from the novel and l we forget jane austen place scene in certain location for reason for example the film put the big darcy proposal scene outside in storm in front of neoclassical temple as oppose to inside the collins parsonage why do jane austen put it in the parsonage because while lizzy and darcy speak with total if brutal honesty to each other in this scene the collins have never share an honest word why the rain and the outdoor proposal it look like jane eyre meeting rochester and when elizabeth walk across windy field to stand on cliff and view the panorama one expect her to cry heathcliffe at any minute austen have be bronteized judy dench be great actress but lady catherine be suppose to be tall and strike the petite tom hollander be brilliant actor but mr collins be describe in the novel as tall and heavy look which suggest that his terrible dancing with poor lizzy be elephantine matthew macfayden be another favorite of mine from mi 5 on e in p however he be more the young heathcliffe never smile though austen observes in the novel that darcy smile at lizzy quite bit and she realize this when she see his wonderful smile portrait at pemberley portrait that in this movie be for some reason replace by sculptured marble bust and much of austen dialogue be change to modern speech mr bingley have be turn into such clown that one wonder why darcy would have him as friend and why jane bennet would love him the bottom line be that while this be great movie to watch and hear it deviate from jane austen novel so much that any student who watch it think she could substitute view for read would fail
pioneer in its time on the form one can deny that the actor be all rather accurate and most importantly that the cinematography be so refined it doesn give the impression the movie be shoot in 1942 now the problem lie in the content the first half of the film be pretty annoy endeavour to set the tone of plot that struggle to really initiate its development the pace accelerate in the second half revive the interest but the dramatic progression remain quite difficult and the movie overall doesn turn out to be convince enough despite well write dialogues moreover it fall sometimes bite too easily into melodramatiscim with for instance much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tire quickly anyway for sure casablanca be pioneer in its time but like lot of other old classic critic seem to favour too much this aspect compare to the intrinsic quality of the movie which would explain why it be so highly regarded
okish but really slow move with the cast they have and the concept expect it to be more funny and fun yet it linger on and take long time to get off the ground great visuals and animation lacking in excitement and ultimately come to head in seemingly the last 30 minute with some excitement and laugh
what this be like spike lee direct george romero movie that could have be an hour short all of the infected look like gollum from lord of the ring mixed with beowulf if the flashback be frame near the beginning maybe would have care if he be alone with the lack of soundtrack it make the movie drag on like it be four hour long and do we need to place the camera on will smith for two minute watch him stare at nothing he only have about two expression in his repertoire anyway this movie could have be great but it be edit all weird and could have use some music to heighten his alone time to pull us into his miserable world if you want to see the concept do correctly in my opinion check out the last man on earth with vincent price same thing do well or even omega man with charlton heston they be actually more real and scary just another example of hollywood put style over substance to give the fresh prince an oscar nod

a story about nothing ralph fiennes play the character beautifully and carry the movie for the first half alas not enough to make it interest while the start be promise and portrays basil ralph fiennes passion and great work halfway through the movie the storyline just switch what start as an ode to basil work the importance of the find and mr pretty trust quickly turn into story love story about two character we hardly care about suddenly basil be nothing more than sideline character who just kind of there like the maker of the movie just decide to make completely different film halfway through feel the movie do little more justice to acknowledge basil work than history have do by not acknowledge it his importance and find have be overshadow by random love story we ve all see before in many other movie and to have sideline the archeological find and basil importance for some cheap love story feel wrong
not oscar worthy this movie should have never make it to the oscar

less powerful variation on la grande bellezza follow the huge success and critical acclaim of his film la grande bellezza the great beauty in 2013 winner of oscar best foreign film for 2013 among numerous other award modern favorite of mine and what think be the best film of its year the italian director paolo sorrentino follow film be la giovinezza youth film in english with an english speaking cast for which he do the writing after revive the felliniesque spirit in the great beauty and the modern powerful tour de force cinematic ride that it be it be inevitable that the following work after lose the element of novelty will never reach the same height especially with the high expectation place unless the writer director opt for different style which he do not youth be continuation of the same theme the story follow two old friend an orchestra conductor and film director play by the great michael caine and harvey keitel in very fine performance on long vacation in luxury hotel at the alp they reflect on their life as well as their child and the peculiar hotel guest contemplate in poetic way what make life worth living as expect collaboration with the cinematographer luca bigazzi yield another feast for the eye the great cinematography along with the impeccable acting be probably what propel the film forward and make it worth the admission fee write however be the main low point of the film with the bland monotonic over baked dialogue that help give the story an overall feeling of hollowness and pretentiousness it be not sorrentino first attempt at writing and direct english film but it can still be argue that significant difference in the level of write between the last two film suggest that the outcome might have be good if the film be in italian comparison with sorrentino previous film however be inevitable and the parallel be too many in the previous film we have the age protagonist reflect on the meaning of life and the modern decadence while wander the street of rome and in between raucous party with his rich idle companion here the street and rooftop of rome be replace by the alp long polemic monologue ruthlessly slat friend be replace by one give by rachel weisz character and another give by jane fonda in an impressive cameo instead of the catholic nun we get buddhist monk where the predictable storyline meant that the acquainted viewer would know before the end of the film whether we will be able to see him levitate or not generally speak the film felt less surreal and magical even though it try so hard at profundity and abstraction the flat dialogue at most time be not help by the persistence of the mountainous background but the film definitely have its moment the maradona interlude an example and the visual mastery and brilliant act make the film worth watch this be hardly surprising after the great beauty but sincerely hope sorrentino bounce back in his next feature
funny but think this movie be really well do and quite funny but why in the world do they have to have so much casual profanity the name of jesus be throw around like teen age girl use exclamation mark in note to her girl friend it be somewhat in character but it isn really necessary who write this anyway they certainly be enlighten and free of the inhibition that plague those of us who live normal life like alan arkin he be great in the russian be come and like peter falk as well think they could have be just as funny without take the name of the lord in vain it would be nice if god and jesus get the same respect as some of the earth bound god
fantastic film this be great film it be well construct the acting be superb and the character be so likeable or in the case of the pig so detestable 9
the idea behind it be great there be some flaw with the movie the animation be possibly 6 10 there be lot of animation error that at some point in the movie make it look very lazily do the animation wasn entirely break but there be definitely part that could have be brush over not as good as the first lion king the voice acting be 8 10 there be scene where some of the line speak be just whisper and be hard to hear without turn up the volume few time there could almost be hint of awkwardness in the line but they be forgivable think that the vaing be slightly improve over the first lion king where it sound like the voice actor be afraid to raise there voice to add to the drama the music would be 7 5 10 few of the song be simple and short almost like they be simply add in to say hey we make song other song be just there for fun and to progress the story quickly there be few great composition and song that really stand out though the first lion king do good job with song the writing be bit odd at time perhaps 6 10 rating some line felt dull and lifeless others seem to want to add to the drama but didn quite do so and yet others seem plain and bore almost cliché as though the writer couldn think of what to write that would progress the story along the character still remain who they be it didn feel the writer have leave anybody behind though timon and pumbaa be still themselves as well which be great execution of story would be 9 10 though in my humble opinion feel that the writer and director do good job of tell story even if it didn look or sound the pretty they do good job of portray kiara as have the same curiosity that simba have as cub and simba struggle to raise her in way that would prevent her from experience what he have go through it depict him try to stay in his father paw step and lead the pride in the right direction ever since watch this movie ve begin to realize that perhaps movie doesn need to have the best writing acting and animation in the world to be good sometimes it the story behind it that can make the movie amazing as long as it balance out with act music and animation thoroughly enjoy this movie and it have special place in my favorite movie right up next to the first lion king as classic and fitting end to the series even if it not the high quality movie around would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who be look to see if it worthwhile to watch
nothing happens and it take 3 hour this be the emperor new clothes all over again the movie run two hour and 45 minute to cover 12 year and believe me it seem like 12 year there be nothing of interest in the film it be about nothing nothing happen except child grow up parent grow up child make friend parent marry again and again no drama no humor no sadness no happiness just boring people lead bore life and the gimmick of use real child and film them at yearly interval to show how they grow be just that gimmick the boy of the title be slack seek meaning by do nothing save your money and more important save your three hour and see another movie any other movie
how be this movie rat so highly don understand how so many people can say this movie be great think it be terrible this be the kind of movie where car blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireball not only that but the dialogue be cheesy with typical one liner like m too old for this the plot be reminiscent of one of the not as good season of 24 but not as develop as state by other user the villain be the best part of the movie perhaps m bias because this movie have be hype up to me for so many year and when finally watch it be extremely disappointed but regardless the movie be bad although there be plenty bad out there probably would have rat the movie lower but it be entertain enough that be able to get through it despite be tempt to turn it off several time
don waste your time on this one haven see this movie in many year and perhaps should watch it again but remember try to get through it the first time be sheer torture keep wait for anything to happen you know how you will stick with movie ten minute at time after the first half you think it get to get well not this one it be the most boring piece of crap have ever see one of these day maybe when m in vegetative state and nobody be around to change the channel ll watch it again not for some reason the hamster here think that it require some long drawn out critique of movie for us to express ourselves unlike professional movie critic who blow smoke and pat each other on the back praise their pseudo intellect we can actually say whether we like or dislike movie in few succinct sentence so hopefully my entry be long enough now it a shame isn it
intolerant homosexual at the time of write 1000 froth gay activist most who have not even see the film have rat this piece 1 even if you don like the premise this be an impossible task for any narrative which have reason and decent production value therefore once again the homosexual community lie just like short decade ago when they be try to tell us one third of the population be gay census info tell us that be horseshit too wake up and smell the rose you be intolerant of any view outside of your own you say love be important but you can dialogue with anyone that want to keep the original definition of marriage newsflash you don need the state to affirm the love you already share ya ll want acceptance be happy to give it but its moment like this that have result in the opposite you will never have peace while you think your whole identity revolve around your sexuality

heartbreaking waste of talent 2 10 for the best effort of sigorney weaver and gene hackman in this waste of time comedy wan na be ms weaver do her best to bolster stupid story and poor script hackman manage to walk through most of the film and still give it some credibility typical sight gag can not save this poorly write and direct film about mother and daughter whore team out to whoo rich men and then grab huge divorce settlement or death benefit be so 1960 it would have be somewhat more comic if it be father son team although less politically correct suppose we have too many buddy film already jenifier love hewitt be pleasure to watch her skin tight outfit be almost worth the admission or rental fee that it she have minimal act or comic ability walk ons by anne bancroft and ray liotta be another waste of talent
unremitting abuse why would anyone put themselves through watch this movie perhaps if they be grossly abuse as child and want to feel that their suffering be not as bad as that of the boy in the movie that the sole decent reason can imagine the director have shoot it and cut it to convey the confusion and terror and inexplicable nature of abuse even though it be never shoot from the child point of view and not even the child be suitable for the viewer sympathy the bad problem be that even though the trailer start with state it be base on true story it isn so those watch it be have their trust abuse the book upon which the movie be base in point be series of episode that seem to be in the life of one boy from infancy to late teen write in magical realism style by woman writer in the name of male character she have invent and hire people to play at interview and reading and celebrity gathering that invent character increasingly play as trans gender in turn claim they be his her true story such be the american literary world the story be from imagination with the help of material from assort psychiatric case history which in turn be often bias to support baseless psychiatric theory they show marked lack of locational research the film director have cleverly remove the evidence of that lack but the book really damn fault remain that it string together terrible progress of story of gross child abuse as if they happen to one child and as if they somehow portray develop character and situation when they aren and don so the film as the book diminish make to seem comparatively trivial the reality of child abuse at the same time as promote theory that further abuse child by twist the way they be see child for example do not seek out sexual abuse in some way to emulate their mother as be imply that be pernicious lie base on psychoanalytic theory that benefit abuser watch the official french dvd with the english soundtrack and french subtitle which be rather bad the influence of psychoanalysis in france may explain dvd release there alone the sensational scene on the cover of the dvd with mother and son together in match lacy woman underwear make up and curl be not in the movie
and you will know my name be the sin eater when lay my vengeance upon you never really liked movie about religion especially these creepy thriller stigma be bad bless the child be bad lose soul doesn have much promise although m sure ll see it eventually time changer be preachy disaster end of day be like terminator in reverse etc luckily the order be more in the vein of something like boondock saint hugely violent film with strong religious undertone that have lot of similar meaning as this movie do but boondock saint be one of the good one the big question however come up when you wonder how far can they go in create religious justification for revenge boondock saint at least have the right state of mind that movie be gear more to the revenge idea with less emphasis on the religious justification than this one the possibility indeed probability be leave open that the brother be couple of ultra violent defender of the bible and god word but the extension of the word to bloody killing be make by them not god or the bible the order take that one step far win say that the movie try to make the bible justify kill in order to bring to sinner what would really come to them anyway in the afterlife if that your belief but what important to realize here be that the sin eater as be dealt with heavily in the second half of this movie be spiritual creature sin eating be power evidently pass on from one generation of sin eater to the next while the two brother in boondock saint be just two guy with vicious dedication to their belief heath ledger unfortunately strike me more as hugely popular american actor place into the movie maybe for name recognition than as an actor who fit the part of the character he doesn for even second for example come across as an experienced priest with traumatic past but ledger be not able to bring this across in his performance he a member of an unfortunate breed of young actor that know he popular and so doesn think he have to work for it anymore you may remember too many of the actor in this movie from previous work by the director as well as one too much from one of paul verhoeven massively successful gritty action film which need not be name since this particular actor have have the name of that movie permanently brand across his forehead so you can just read it there but really don think that that be where the majority of the problem with this movie come from the order have great preview it one of maybe 2 4 movie in my life that ve watch because of the preview saw at the video store but it seem that the religious thriller be subgenre even more plagued with failure and repetition than horror genre which ve come to study more and more lately the order make some interesting point and it have its moment but as whole it come across as just another attempt to make thriller out of some sort of divine justification for brutal punishment
just skip this trash this be bad movie do not try to find out any hidden meaning in this piece of trash because there be nothing there be no plot no thought no idea in this horrible thing only thing you may like be nude scarlett johansson in many scene be wonder be she the same lady who give us powerhouse performance in marriage story or do heart win job in jojo rabbit maybe the avenger year make her lose her sanity so one piece of advice avoid this and save your valuable time
anti climactic this film hold my interest have good acting and be well make however it be bit of let down lot of buildup and no real follow through worth watch suppose but be leave feeling like it need more and be bit disappointed

to coin phrase it ok but like their old stuff well ahhhh the simpson 20 year and still go strong well still go anyway think break point for me come when recently felt strongly enough about new episode that ring friend to tell him that the new simpson episode be actually very good that depress when you think about it especially consider that ve be watch it and love it since day 1 it be maybe 10 year since could make that call and mean it so after nearly 20 year they decide to announce movie at last or realistically 10 year after at last once it finally do arrive though the film be pretty good good than expect early on but as will point out again and again momentum just couldn last thanks to homer of course springfield have become the most polluted city in america in an update on escape from new york it be domed off with giant glass object from which there be apparently no escape the inhabitant of springfield be as the creator of the dome put it trap like carrot it be the event lead up to the doming and subsequent escape that show the most promise all of the show regular be show but many seem underutilised burn and smithers get maybe 1 minute total there be some quality joke to be have mostly due to homer lack of parent skill and people get hurt there be also some full bartal nudity the guest star if you can have one in film and m say you can be russ cargill the bos of the environmental protection agency who place the dome to protect the earth he be voice by albert brook marlin himself and he get most of the best line in the movie include the trap like carrot one mention earlier unfortunately though what ensue be strongly reminiscent of the show lifespan so far great start homer get most of the laugh marge be the voice of reason and the bringer of down lisa have subplot that go nowhere show run out of momentum halfway and we must realise the best be behind us in fact can now pinpoint the exact moment that the movie lose it 35 minute simpson family escape the dome cargill order around the clock surveillance have soft tuff guy rant and admit to be drink with power it be brilliant 30 second unfortunately nothing after it come close to be as good the simpson be pariahs in their own town and flee to alaska only once happily ensconsed in palin backyard they find out that cargill have start to doubt his own dome and have far more severe and permanent plan in mind for springfield marge and the kid set off to save the day while homer search for deep truth which he find when he meet lady with giant boob aren they always the answer in truth giant boob lady be just gimmicky and tacky the lisa new admirer bit be waste of time aside from give her few minute screen time and marge have little to do in the film aside from doubt her marriage the first half be actually pretty great even if the only thing the dopey and impressionable remember be spiderpig if you watch the second half in isolation as two 20 minute episode you would go away very unimpressed still love the simpson but boost the first half of film be little like cheer when your sport team lose narrowly to well opponent an honourable defeat but defeat nonetheless despite that even though this be by no mean classic it have enough good joke and even sub par simpson be still funny final rating 7 5 10 all the bagging and 7 5 as say average simpson be still pretty good if you like the simpson you will laugh you will very likely enjoy this it just isn a patch on season 3 through say 8
it be ok first half in dumpy gunky 70s ny they almost read my mind because the second half be in tropical latin country and the good portion the two do their histrionics the main dude be also note for some good flick be he thief be he cia guy who know only the shadow know
very interesting movie know that there be mclaren side and lydon side and they hate each other and lydonists also hate this movie for me they be both nasty and egocentric guy with their bad and good idea whatever don care about the ideology of the movie but the movie be surprisingly good and interesting have see several rock film and this be one of best documentary fiction feature part and animation be cut together in very entertaining way and don see any problem in direct and act surprisingly professional movie and maybe without swindle we wouldn have so much footage of sex pistol and the whole 70 punk scene
all ingredient be there for good movie but the story be lame like someone say before or you love this movie or you win think much of it you can categorize me with the second option didn think much of it and could not wait for this movie to be over ve just be lure by the name of the cast harvey keitel and michael caine be both actor really like and even in this movie they do good job with their acting performances the filming technique be also excellent nothing bad to say about that the nature scenery from switzerland be also nice to look at so why would rate youth below average because when watch movie need to be entertain the movie have to have an interesting story story well tell and even for drama that be not necessary my thing the story have to be interesting and sometimes it be but with youth didn get anything of that it a long boring story about basically nothing too bad because you have all the right ingredient to make it good movie but without decent story you can have good movie
disappointed every now and then there a movie that have lot of hype surround it and everyone seem to talk about it and without doubt the hangover be one of those movie unfortunately it doesn live up to or deserve the hype it get find it to be rather empty comedy and can understand why so many people seem to think it so humorous apparently wasn the only one not to enjoy it the audience be part of barely let out snicker during the entire flick think lot of the attempt at humor be force and lot of the joke fell flat the act wasn very impressive either particularly that of zach galifianakis overall d say to avoid this movie if you don want to be disappoint be it the bad movie ve ever see no however there be far good comedy out there d recommend over this for sure
an awful movie this movie be bad not annoy bad because watch it till the end just bad the main idea be curious enough for short story but nothing more on top of that the plot lack consistency how be it that you get so many zero lover in the same district of some far away american village but perhaps it be not suppose to be consistent the acting be ok although it be very amateurish at time it be bit weird how hollywood or its offspring produce the clone of famous actor be it to make low budget movie more attractive and it not funny didn quite understand why it get the credit for be comedy here and even good one so if you be out to get comedy that actually make you laugh go look for something else
not good after saw this movie think about other film blade runner blade runner be masterpiece best movie about artificial intelligence in blade runner you can see what be consequence if human make robot we see everything feel everything like hope freedom evolution obviously the final scene of blade runner be remarkable but ex machina can say anything it completely backward if blade runner be 9 ex machina be 1 of curse think 1 be very good for this film can believe what movie go to oscar to name of best picture every year academy work worst this movie don have any act directing write cinematography score any new idea so what be that in 2001 we saw artificial intelligence the movie can say something we can see the little david have hope to see her mother hope he wish to be real human wish and but ex machina be really have nothing to say nothing
brilliant story fail by jumbled direction and an ordinary lead while watch this movie catch myself wish be read the book instead surely this be an adaptation from well construct thriller with interesting character neat plot twist and insight into workplace that indicate deep research there be no book there be at least three ridiculous leap to move the story arc along where less confusing connection would have suffice those gap plot hole unfortunately ruin something that could have be gem lastly ben affleck be inconsistent in the lead role he be not the reason the movie fails but be certainly miscast while in few scene he seem to have the tic and dispassion his character require in others he make too much eye contact or speech modulation imagine someone like edward norton nail this role
didn work for me on any level go into this movie with decent hope give the high rating it have but it not like be over expecting or anything in the end find this thing total mess think for me it try to ride too many line and as result fail in most aspect it try to take itself serious as spy movie yet it also try to be this weird comedy and while think movie be capable of do both this one just didn do it well or right to the point where it just bounce me out of the movie completely far as it take itself seriously find it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of be stupid far as the comedy just didn think the nuclear head explosion or the mcdonalds be serve on silver platter be funny at all grant m american and get that english humor be bit different but love monty python snatch mr bean even most of the bond film yet most of the funny moment in this movie just find remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it be quick laugh it just completely bounce me out of the movie and the few comical moment that be actually funny be already cover in the trailer so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurt the movie now on the take itself seriously aspect the whole spy gig the young recruit it just fail on that level for me as well certain aspect of the action scene be do well and some of the bullet time action be good but think the editing need lot of work the massacre in the church just think be way over do and too long find it amaze in movie like this how fight scene go on for many minute and when it all do people be barely winded breathe normally give me break go watch professional boxer or mma fighter and see how they look after just one round and they be real athlete who train vigorously so while some of the action be okay it be so over the top that again it bounce me out of the movie so between the bad comedy and overcooked action be constantly be remind that be watch movie rather than be sweep up into one my last beef be with the main kid and the whole recruitment training camp probably what bounce me out of the movie the most be here we have some reckless rebellious kid who train to this point have be gymnastics so okay he flexible have good balance etc yet with little to no further training at all he the big bad as the recruitment initiation program be joke it wasn a training program of any kind it be basically lets throw these kid in no win situation and see how the fend and who come out on top get the idea be they be try to weed through all the recruit to get the best one but the whole while keep think so this kid be just natural born bad as because he do gymnastics and have daddy issue then once he out and start real life spy work he untouchable and good than all the world master assassins it like her mom bf who bully him early in the movie who he confront in the end and m thinking so other than be this super spy what have he do to actually improve his skill as fighter overall think the action be decent but very over the edge of what you consider to be believable movie believability mean the black comedy be pretty flat and do very little in make me laugh or enjoy myself finally the believability of this kid take over for his dad and his quasi predecessor be just absurd give it 3 10 one point on principle and because like the main spy girl 2nd point because some of the action be decent and 3rd point for the best part of the movie which be the bare as scene at the end which shock me enough to yell out hello
the most overrated animation of all time can define up as the stolen 90 minute of my life actually have really high expectation about up before watch it however it be so bad barely finish the movie can say that the main character be well create and write on the other hand there be no story in the movie except the little clip that tell the carl life in the beginning there be nothing good and original thing in the movie it be full of the cliché dialogue and cheesy joke also the side character be weak and poor they have nothing to add to the story however have to give it that clip mention earlier be really awesome wish that the movie would be about ellie and carl try make their dream come true together
it make me mad that this film be not get the credit it deserve it be in my opinion one of the most underrated film of all time along with the matrix reload revolution be undoubtedly different from the previous film both in general and in term of tone but why be that necessarily bad thing win be so arrogant as to say that the people who don like this film be unintelligent whether or not people like film or not be subjective matter but can help feeling that the people who dislike or even hate this film be miss something because revolution be an intelligent entertaining beautiful sad and move picture the acting of all three film have be mixed bag and although usually join in the bashing of keanu reef find him strangely fit for the part of neo his voice be not the perfect voice due to its monotonous tone but his body language be very good and sometimes even great and that be the case in revolution as well carrie anne moss play her character like she do in film two and that be neither particularly good or bad but decent performance laurence fishbourne character have be reduce somewhat for the final part of the series but find that the line he do have be deliver with conviction and experience as most people know gloria foster die before finish her scene for revolution and thus different actress be cast to take over the choice fell on mary alice and while she be no where near as good as foster she be decent enough ian bliss get chance to show his worth in the third film and personally find his scene to be among the most interesting of the film and his uncanny imitation of weaving be spot on most of the secondary cast from reload return in their part in revolution and they all do decent job with their character harry lennix lock improve his character tremendously in spite of limited screen time hugo weave still provide the best acting in the film and steal every one of his regrettably limit number of scene he be probably my all time favorite screen bad guy he manage to show the change in his character remarkably well consider how limited his screen time be agent smith exhibit an increase amount of human trait include anger hatred jealousy and even sly sense of humor this change happen to mirror neo grow understanding of the machine neo and smith be link in that way as well the effect be of course extraordinary which be to be expect after the stellar effect in the second film although there weren as many scene inside the matrix this time around still find the effect of the real world to be awe inspire at the least and the battle for zion be an incredible display of special effect of course the director never lose sight of the people involve in the battle make it more tense have it only be effect the climactic battle between neo and smith be quite simply stun it take roughly 15 minute and for one hardly breathe in those 15 minute all three matrix film have be inspire by japanese animé comic and that be very visible in the final battle as one can help but think of dragonball for instance the action in that particular scene be frighteningly well do and get the chill when watch it in the cinema very well do the story be darker in this film than in either of the previous film but that be to be expect as the first film be about birth and the second about life obviously that mean that the third be about the inevitable end that must come to us all death this do that the tone of the film becomes much darker and felt that be good this do that the film distance itself from the previous film in the series and rather than become another rerun the film become its own entirely and that be both its weakness and its strength think it be its strength as it increase the originality of the film but apparently lot of people didn like the interpretation that the third film represent as be clear from the bash the film have get from audience and critic alike the film do still have great symbolic value and you can interpret the film in great number of way like the previous film for me this improve the film greatly as you can watch it again and again and still find new thing that will renew your interest sadly can not make you love this film as much as do because that would defeat the purpose of the film which be to make people think for themselves my conclusion about revolution be that you will either love or you will hate it but in my opinion revolution be almost as good as the first one and one of the best film have ever see 9 10 on my top 10 of best film
it fine honestly dont get the hate for this film it be fine not amaze certainly not terrible two week after release sit in sell out cinema with an entertained audience lot of whom cry at appropriate moment yes it weird and at time bore because the song just keep bleed into each other but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kid will like not nearly as bad as people have be say the mr mestophalies scene and the scene where she sing memory be the two best scene you cant fault the dancing performer or most of the sing the set and vfx be solid for the most part and it actually really impressive technically it fine
yes slow but yes true to the old style zombies this movie just trudge along 60s haitian worker decade earlier in the storyline be purposefully give pufferfish tetrodotoxin with an abrade additive through his skin he die sort of perhaps just heart rate suspension anyway he bury then dig up to work as slave zombie style labor in sugar plantation decade later young female relative be in french school where she tell the tale of voodoo practice in haiti which eventually play into turn our storyline into misadventure lot of jump back forth between the two location period good accuracy in the basic narrative but drags end be little weird
i want my money back whaat vote rating of 8 0 for this crap movie be you serious tell me you have not be smoke oh no please those who have not watch this movie yet please do not waste your time there be nothing in this crap no serious story or serious act anywhere near george clooney appear for just 5 minute only can you believe they advertise him as main actor then its full of unbelievable plot and scene for eg sandra bullock repeatedly tell george clooney that she do not know how to navigate the soyuz but she not only do it as highly skilled astronaut do it but safely return to earth in one piece punch the exact right button in any shuttle she jump in to pl don ask me how she travel to each of those shuttle in mid universe they be only possible in video game so unbelievable and artificial those who make this movie must have think all the movie goer be still in their primary school age oh give me my money back
not the same without dudikoff this be my first and most likely also the last time to watch american ninja 3 blood hunt it just wasn an american ninja movie without michael dudikoff this third movie be more of mutation between karate kid and american ninja but it just never take hold on either account sean boy who be orphan and take in by japanese and trained to be ninja be participate in martial art competition but when he see his sensei kidnap the martial art competition become of no interest and sean set out to find his kidnap sensei and fight all the ninja in his way right seriously couldn they have come up with something just bit more original why boil soup on formula already exhaust the acting in this third installment to the american ninja series be up to par with the previous movie adequate but not particularly memorable as with the previous movie you know exactly how the movie will unfold as they use the same recipe three time by now and to top the icing on the cake american ninja 3 blood hunt have an overly annoying piano score play throughout large part of the movie be sure it be intend to compliment the movie but it just add level of idiotic spoof to the atmosphere of the movie and it be especially entertaining to see sean throw to arrows yes throw and kill two ninjas with them despite lack originality and the original american ninja star then this third movie be adequate albeit slightly less mediocre in entertainment value
outstanding 3d and generally funny take my girlfriend to see this film as she love guinea pig and have to be honest wasn expect much from it but couldn of be more surprised when actually saw it this film doesn get bore for one second from start to finish the 3d effect be nothing short of brilliant and the guinea pig although animate look completely real think it be funny and think the cast do great job with the voice really hope people do go and see this one while they can as it would be shame not to get sequel make just because of so many people give it bad review who clearly can of see this film as it be no where near as bad as the first few review make it out to be it be generally funny and fast paced and worth watch for any age
a more positive view consider dirty dancing to be in the top 5 film of the 1980s don agree with its politics but tip my hat to its honesty and artistry it be story of its time top gun may have be more intense from the male view but both film connect to the soul in the same way jennifer grey and meg ryan as woman make profound connection in the two film it matter not that they be so different different be what make the connection so comfortable it be complete pleasure view dirty dancer and look forward to watch top gun beautiful story beautiful woman set around the most beautiful photography ever all that say it doesn even break my top 50 mike
ppl still think despite keanu despite the plot hole despite the horrendous end the matrix be good movie the story make no sense but at least they didn try to explain anything which would have be disastrous and with the special effect and pace they almost get away be just happy to learn there be still people out there who do think when they watch movie too bad for the matrix the more you think the less you like it but if you can just stare at the screen and enjoy the moment ah ignorance be bliss hmm maybe the matrix do have some social commentary to it what think
bore stupid turd of movie computer system name eagle eye decides to do some thing that involve recruit 2 seemingly ordinary people car chase shoot out jump off tall building more chase tough nosed fbi agent etc etc look can handle suspension of disbelief but this movie be both boring and stupid the main tension you get when watch this movie be wonder if there be actually go to be any interesting plot twist or idea explore or will they stand on the train track and let the train run over them 1 they have computer system that can control thing great why not put some limit on that system mean they do that in die hard 4 and that be movie where bruce willis shoot down helicopter with car 2 be the computer right or wrong that be the only possible interesting part of the movie but they just ignore the whole thing the computer represent the legal system of the united state which invoke the whole idea of magna carta and the fact that they king be not above the law but that be ignore anyway ignore this movie unless you be really bored
stay true to the big joke but this may confuse some before anyone see this film zach snyder should be give pat on the back he do what dozen director struggle to do for twenty year he make watchman movie it seem unthinkable that anyone could properly put the great graphic novel of all time on the screen but snyder have do pretty much that while it be not alan moore watchman it be the close thing that anyone else could have put on the screen snyder approach the material with enough reverence that fan of the comic will appreciate the film as snyder have openly declare the final act do include significant change but the alteration that take place fit good on the big screen than the original end would have it work because it cut down on lot of the necessary back story which snyder could not include even though many page of the book be not include snyder do take the time to try and preserve other information by include short historical sequence in the fantastic opening title sequence by this point viewer will also have have chance to appreciate the stellar and time appropriate soundtrack unlike the hard rock recording the snyder chose for the background of 300 watchman background fit the tone and mood of most of the scene the only questionable choice be the selection of leonard cohen hallelujah not because of the recording but rather its awkward placement some may also question snyder inclusion of gore not present in the book while the comic do include it share of violence snyder do overtly change several scene to be more violent these change while flashy on film may disturb squeamish moviegoer however change aside snyder have capture the essence of the book and package it in beautiful 2 hour and 40 minute delight overall it be satisfy film experience for someone familiar with the source material but this might be different experience for anyone who do not know the book there be lot to digest and the overwhelming visuals may distract some moviegoer from the big picture the interaction of these unique character remain an integral point to understand this film and when the book be par down for the movie the relationship of the masked adventure become bit more forced the best part of the comic be the glimpse of what be beneath the hood and we have less of that in snyder adaptation additionally the end while simplify be still bit convoluted fan and those previously unfamiliar with watchman should go in with an open mind snyder have perform what doctor manhattan might deem miracle so it may take more than one view to truly appreciate this unique adaptation
don let your kid watch the bit where the horse die seriously just don it a horrible sad slow death and what bad be that the horse actually die accidentally when they film it death it practically an animal snuff movie oh and it a pretty bad film anyway
a pose of profundity this be continental production and maybe the best guide for prospective viewer be whether they usually enjoy continental film or not if you find them often stupid and affect it easy to have the same impression of this film know from the synopsis that plot and action wouldn be the strong point of the film but do think that it might have humour wit and pathos in fact it have little of any of these the screenplay try to be quirky and different and to engage the viewer by bring in grotesque character and nude flesh it just enough to maintain sufficient interest but any viewing enjoyment be largely create by the photography of beautiful setting the dialogue be stilted particularly in the mouth of child actor maybe it all translate which would explain the lack of realism overall there nothing too reward about watch the idle and overprivileged not really enjoy themselves in expensive comfort you might expect there to be some pathos when one of the protagonist meet sad end but in fact it seem like another piece of selfishness to judge from the title the film plume itself on have some philosophical message it hard to be sure what the message be maybe it that selfish people finally realize that they have empty life but m guess here think it more let make movie which can pose as something deep and profound the musical item which end the story be nice in fact if it have go on for another 10 minute would have felt more charitable towards the film you ve really get something well to do with your time than watch youth
bit cheesy but okay same as ewok main draw for me be norwich as that my home town that be the first bit that annoy me be that it look nothing like norwich castle at all norwich be fair size in late 1300 for place back then don mind bit of adapt for film but atleast try and get it bit close same with language read menu in diner what okay so if you can grit your teeth and just watch it it not bad it a cheesy nice little film these christmas movie be mean to be bad and that make them good to watch just enjoy it for what it be and don expect too much
pretty good be bit apprehensive about watch this movie consider that the current rottentomatoes score be dismal 23 so much for the critic story line be pretty weak but guess that all could be do if you want to stick to the video game format some good casting choice some bad aaron keaton ramus dominic ramon do it for me imogen dakota harrison scott he be so irritating african american should protest the stereotyping do not couldn understand how imogen character go from savvy biz to dreamy ditz element of the game like the build up to the final race police car chase attempt roadblock the police car pile driver be really low point helicopter surveillance etc be feature the movie be engross and didn feel the length of the two hour however some major plot hole inconsistency didn work for me but hey its base on video game appreciate the director for not resort to the f style of direction watch it if you like car chase and or aaron would have like him to say bitch at least once but can have everything
finally stream service know how to produce in 4k love the expanse from the beginning but amazon prime take season 5 to another level in their own studio do not think the directing be very good in episode 1 but that change the continuation of the story be excellent the cg be awesome be so happy prime pick this show up it will be the best series ever
flaw hero flaw film snyder watchman be decidedly dark and visceral film which candidly illustrate the flaw of hero unfortunately this be as detrimental to the film as it be advantageous it be of importance to note snyder stay fairly loyal to the graphic novel however possibly due to the continue development hell that surround the film everything come across as compulsory and superficial the aforementioned flaw of the hero be painstakingly bring to the audience attention in fragment for instance the comedian be rapist dr manhattan have nearly lose all ability to relate to humanity rorschach be blindly obsess with justice and ozymandias determines the only way to save humanity be by destroy large part of it in addition silk spectre ii exhibit her adulterous nature in very awkward sex scene on board nite owl ii fly machine be the film sound pretentious well it most assuredly be among the actor there be not an inspired let alone stand out performance every character include our narrator rorschach seem merely to be go through the motion this lackluster presentation from the cast epitomize the entirety of the film which be carry largely by grandiose visuals and reliance on the original story rather than any new or interesting interpretation of the work itself further weakness in the film include the melodramatic musical cue that sound as though they come directly from snyder favorite ipod play list simply because the film be set in 1985 should not have mean that all of the music feature within the film come before that time period for instance it be difficult to contain sneer of disgust as 99 luft balons kick in also song such as the sound of silence hallelujah and all along the watchtower be so comfortably familiar that it detract from the gloomy unrefined focus of the film move away from musical discrepancy be the glow blue genitalia truly necessary this be one aspect of the graphic novel snyder could have deviate from without much complaint from fan arguably the most significant area of discontentment stem from the closing sequence of the film these shortcoming will be break down into three part 1 ozymandias obliterates large portion of the population and lead everyone to believe it be the fault of dr manhattan his reason world unite in peace they have to be sacrifice give the history of our tumultuous existence as specie it be difficult to believe this would end in peace it be far more likely that weapon creator across the globe would immediately begin work on large and more powerful armament in hope of destroy the ostensibly omnipotent dr manhattan 2 ozymandias have effectively harness the power of dr manhattan and use it to implement the aforesaid destruction however if he have successfully discover mean to utilize this power could he not have just as easily use this power to prevent nuclear war entirely at the very least this newfound power could have be exercise to wipe out the current nuclear weapon supply 3 the remain character of the film seem altogether indifferent to the fact that rorschach be kill by manhattan manhattan be betray by ozymandias and ozymandias perpetrate as many or more murder than adolf hitler aside from the compulsory nature of the film limit artistic interpretation from the director lackluster performance by the actor poor choice in musical cue an end that lend itself to question not david lynch open to interpretation question but what the hell be they think question and let us not forget the glow blue penis the film be not without redeem quality the austere demeanor of the film be welcome change from the typical hero film of course christopher nolan already perfect this with the new batman movie but watchman have noir mystique of its own the fight sequence though bit melodramatic be choreograph well also as be allude to earlier the film be an exhibition in technological progression these fantastic effect help to create the feel of graphic novel watchman be not revolutionary film but it be worth the time it take to view it explore the flaw of hero delivers dark graphic mystique and exhibit stun visuals all while stay relatively true to the original work of moore and gibbon this reviewer score be 5 10
meh on top of meh as watch it literally think to myself this be corny very pointless movie about people go from one location to another miss every reasonable element to comprise decent zombie flick end of the day it watchable but it definitely should have go straight to netflix or maybe the scify channel character be meh zombie be meh even rosario dawson be meh and hear the budget be double if you re go to see it just cut your expectation in half before you go in
how do an informative movie like this accidentally leave out something so important the movie have excellent act flow and be definitely worth watch my big problem with this film be simple there almost zero mention of the government cause the housing market problem by push lender to give out more loan to minority immigrant and anyone else that statistically can afford them the movie love to blame the evil banker when in reality it be the evil and incompetent government that not only force the bank to do it who be definitely willing but play an active role in make sure it continue m not sure if the federal reserve be mention even single time how be that possible in movie about the housing market bubble all of the newly create money loan come straight from the fed
over rat first the good carey mulligan and ralph finnes be both terrific the star be for them they be two enormously talented actor however the material meander it very much run of the mill bbc pot boiler of the kind that miramax trot out twice month in the early 90s with very little to get you excite the creatives seem to have pick that up halfway through the script so they add completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co star and saddle poor lily james with some terrible situation and silly dialogue ben chaplin and lily james pick out sleep arrangement send me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minute the stake of the find at the center of the action be that anglo saxon civilization have attain cultural height in ipswich much early than previously know that seem to be totally irrelevant to the protagonist moment of consequence generally when carey character take on the cultural establishment mostly happen off screen run out of money end up on the cutting room floor if the character the writer and the director don care about the stake why should
no film have move me more than this one ever his for me be masterpiece have enjoy it more with each view carl sagan be great man he promote science in the way it should be portray the profound mysteriousness of our universe with humility and without dogma in his book the demon haunt world he quote einstein all our science measure against reality be primitive and childlike and yet it be the most precious thing we have contact conveys this simple message in subtle yet immensely powerful way the performance be some of the most compelling have see particularly by jodie foster and david morse just magnificent
not perfect but you know what pretty damn good the lost world be film which have to reach very high standard follow the impressive jurassic park which pioneer the consistent use of cgi and arguably one of film most symbolic creature rex because of this pretty good film be slat in one sense justifiably so as the lost world could never compare to the first instalment in the franchise it be always go to be an impossible task to improve on the first film which have so much go for it and unsurprisingly it be not the best film in the world in some respect this film do shoot itself in the foot the end sequence be silly there be numerous unexplored error and for the raptor fan they get pretty raw deal furthermore the lost world continue on the premise that child would be able to survive dinosaur attack while mercenary with gun could not if you leave these issue aside the lost world be respectable movie and no matter how many time watch it do entertain what like be that unlike jurassic park 3 it continue the idea of the dinosaur be animal rather than monster apart from the raptor which be just as scary and monstrous as in the first film none of the animal attack for pleasure or financial gain compare to the human in the film they hunt and kill for their basic need and instincts one could say that the film follow an ecological route and criticise all corporate involvement in animal exploitation plot wise the lost world be basically an add on to the first film we find out that there be another island other than isla nublar with dinosaur call isla sorna and the now bankrupt ingen want to harvest the island in order to ship the dinosaur back to the mainland hammond who have recently lose control of the company however disapprove of this and so decides to construct team to document the animal in order to gain public support for their conservation he try to recruit first film survivor ian malcolm who initially refuse however when malcolm find out his girlfriend dr harding have already go to the island on her own he decide to rescue her what transpire be 2 hour survival movie full of dinosaur attack suspense action and jeff goldblum malcolm attempt sarcasm along the way while the sarcasm may grate after while the movie do have some great one liner nick hammond check clear or wouldn be go on this wild goose chase malcolm well your go to the only place in the world where the geese chase you similarily while the plot isn that complicate the character be enjoyable malcolm be definitely the funny with his sarcastic one liner see above roland play by pete posthelwaite surprising casting as would not expect to see him in hollywood action movie be especially good as the cold yet human hunter character in the film the only annoying character be surprise surprise malcolm daughter kelly who despite spending almost the entire film screaming and whine about the least bit thing stereotype teenager be brave enough to do complicate gymnastic routine inside derelict house on rusty bar to kick raptor through window it be an annoy trait in jurassic park that in every film there be always an annoy kid interestingly when compare to the book the film be do good job jurassic park the film be nowhere near as good as the novel but there be definite improvement over the lost world novel in this film not say the book be bad or for that matter the first film it be just that enjoy the film lot more my advice be to watch the film before you read the book while the book have its moment don expect it to be repeat of crichton classic first novel additionaly the cgi and model come back with avengence as you expect after 4 year of development the dinosaur look good than ever and still look pretty impressive certainly this film have age pretty well the move model have improve as well supposedly both rex in lose world contain twice the equipment of the previous rex from the first film lose world look great and as you would expect from spielberg film have great production value location look sublime with the coniferous forest tall grass and no fencing make the new island look and feel like true lose world rather than science experiment finally personally love the look of the vehicle certainly this be not film which will disappoint or unlike the jp iii will confuse you with its look and feel and as state before have great production value all in all this be severely underrated film which be always go to be slat if it be not 100 as good as its predecessor it be not as good as jurassic park but the lost world be definitely film you can enjoy certainly it will entertain you for its 2 hour duration and have always be personal favourite so its unsurprising that be overjoy to see it move ahead of the disastrous jurassic iii in the imdb poll well deserve result

mediocre family drama this show definitely have possibility the key word be drama and the set up for this show should allow for many season worth the big problem for me so far be the act while some member of the ensemble be great several of the young actor be so bad it be distract while this may be acceptable for comedy where overacting be often part of the charm here it detract from the drama it deaden some moment that be mean to be and should have be serious and though haven watch the show from the begin wonder how teacher and police officer can afford the extremely large and appoint home they reside in especially on the west coast

major disappointment bad movie ever probably not but certainly in the bottom 2 percent of my experience be very excited to see this film have read some favorable review very nuanced new form of sci fi cool soundtrack and all that and think scarlett be often very good sometimes great but boy what let down from the opening sequence thru the end it be pedantic slog it be the slow paced think be super arty filmographer waste of time and my wife have see in long time it remind me of the bad 1960s movie grate soundtrack with arbitrary and bizarre screen shot huge disappointment sure there be couple cool concept black goo suck down guy for their skin and atmospheric urban and rural view of scotland and of course scarlett in the all together or very decent cgi rendition thereof but otherwise really not worth the time sorry scarlett there be no character development almost no dialogue bizarre muzak incredibly slow self important pandering filmography and an overwhelming desire to be art house cool but that about it but at least it be extremely slow do mention that if that be your cup of tea then enjoy but if not save your time and your money for something good which be very easily do
decent exploitation film almost have the right part how could any nut forget gas pump girl this one possibly start the light exploitation comedy that flow into the early 80s mainstream it appear that all the dirty filth invade theater screen since then suddenly give way to this picture that porky would later follow you ll most likely expect the home video version be drastically cut of any excessive garbage but what the difference don be surprise to find this one fairly delightful very amuse and less profane because that the way film like this should be still adults only fun but not at the extreme unless an uncut edition surface hate how movie like this offer plot where get revenge hamper an already sweet story of five young girl run shop so that kind of hurt it if you re addict to shoot on video porn and hope not this isn for you but know you re honest gas pump girl while worth good night rent be surprisingly overlooked gem that need great attention fine reference of cult moviedom check out the video box cover and see for yourself

solid movie but base on religious backstory the movie be well build and have few exceptional moment but it be fully or as much as possible understandable only in certain key and that key be religious or rather spiritual it belong to certain view over the world and make me consider how much some people believe that be the only correct view think it be call gnosticism in its light the movie depict life itself transdimensional that be the human existence on earth be punishment form of demotion for the spirit that inhabit the human body and the angel be here to protect the rule by which these punish spirit in human body have to live there be not much kindness or fairness in this existence unless some individual way of transcend it cut through the harsh rule aside this rather severe framework of thing the story may be captivate perhaps more for down to earth people than for dreamer it be milestone movie so well watch it for personal opinion my take on it however be that if one disagree with its key it may just fall apart bit or if one do not consider the key the movie feed sum of concept that really should declare themselves as such to allow awareness when come into contact with them 6
a corny low budget film with couple of redeem feature this movie begin with 3 member of local motorcycle gang know as the vulture play trick on some high school student during their graduation later that night man name uncle joe huntz hall have mild heart attack and as result can not operate his local gas station because of it fortunately his niece june kirsten baker come up with plan to invite her high school friend to help run it while uncle joe be recover what none of them realize however be the extent at which new service station across the street have ruin uncle joe business and the owner of the new gas station mr friendly dave shelley have no intention of allow anybody to interfere with his profit what mr friendly doesn count on be the ingenuity of june further by the vulture when they decide to join her team now rather than reveal any more will just say that this be the kind of grade film which could have only be produce in the 70 with the music hair style and everything else clearly stand out yet in spite of the obvious low budget extremely simple plot and poor act the movie itself wasn too bad all thing consider what find most enjoyable be that the humor be so basic and corny that it be actually funny in weird sort of way likewise have couple of cute young actress like linda lawrence as betty along with the aforementioned kirsten baker certainly didn hurt either that say while this film clearly isn a good picture by any mean it wasn that bad either and because of that have rat it as just slightly below average
a masterpiece but not for everyone people eat and sleep in the shadow of what we do cosmopolis be not an easy ride and certainly not for everyone resemble dream like feel this be visually beautiful film the performance be great and the dialogue be weird and complex which be obvious it didn please lot of people 5 0 rating be laughable what the hell be go on it one of those film that may require more than one view to fully understand the meaning of each conversation but it totally worth it since you re always gon na discover something new and interesting that will make you think for day you can find quotable line everywhere in this movie the final confrontation might have hypnotize me in some kind of way paul giamatti and robert pattinson deliver one of the best climactic dialogue ve ever see cronenberg give us the vision of the 1 of our society and he create masterpiece that can be think provoke and funny at the same time feel sorry for those who didn get it

run of the mill action film the team as an original tv show be breath of fresh air in many way film during the reagan year it be the first show for long time to show vietnam vet in positive light but essentially the team be funny well write and rather harmless fun as no one really ever get hurt and the message be that if you be clever and resourceful you could beat the bully all in all it be great character base show the big screen adaptation didn really take any of those element that define the show not even the iconic theme tune but create an action film loosely base on the basic principle that they be accuse of crime they do not commit so at the end of the day this could have be an action film with any four exchangeable character as an action film it be okay although find the action sequence draw out and too fast paced as far as the story go there wasn really one but more of an excuse of string together the action sequence it take almost an hour for the film the get start properly what find plainly annoy about the film be the fact that all the location in germany be wrong the aerial shot of frankfurt actually show cologne the station be not frankfurt station car number plate be wrong etc etc
deadlands the rise they do the best they could for some reason go into deadlands want to like it not sure why and unfortunately simply couldn a hyper low budget zombie effort this be the first part of trilogy and be direct by write by and star gary ugarek it your pretty standard stuff an incident occur zombie appear and people do their best to survive trouble be it never really get go there be no actual story what you ll be watch for little over any hour be what happen in the first 15 20 minute of your average zombie movie now as you imagine it look and sound cheap because it be but somehow they make the best of it here it amaze what even the slight bit of talent behind the camera can accomplish in no way be deadlands anything even remotely resemble good film however they certainly get point for effort onto the sequel soon suppose the good above par soundtrackyou can tell effort be madethe bad look sound cheap and nastydreadfully pace
awful not even partly good let start with the act in one word bad in two very bad the main four be act like someone tell them they have just wake up except for the one who isn the trained actor quinton rampage jackson who steal the movie in my opinion and no be not wrestle fan as for the rest face be not slick operator murdock be not really mad just bite off the wall and hannibal well that just liam coast his way through the film the one actress in it look like if she smile her face would crack next the plot twist not plot twist more like slight deviation from straight line so very very obvious and in just about every other action film you ve see five year old could have write it the effect some action scene be do well others look like they run out of time and botch it together the script have the occasional good one liner but in the whole film there be about 10 not worth the two hour to find
with their best effort an incoherent mess from non watchman fan point of view think the movie bomb my 7 other friend and have all kind of complains but we all agree that it have not be good time the theater be deafly quiet when credit roll for my part think the whole movie be very inconsistent and disjoint you have literally 3 distinct flavor of movie blend into one john with his god like superpower that inspire wonder and mysteriousness rorschach with his sin city like action and narration and the comedian dan lori with their good old beat them up action kind of like the batman but to much less cinematography effect it unfortunate that don believe they belong to the same story very well and the short amount of time allow for this movie make it even more suffocating as we re force to just see wee bit of each of them dislike the story on the basis that it do not do these hero justice it appear the fan enjoy them as they be true to the original ask what be the point of stick to the original when you only have 2 45 hour if there be no entertainment value and if the hero don shine on the screen then why bother in the first place there be more than one place in the movie where the story take some very amateurish turn like after the two lovebird have their fun and decide hey maybe we should go save rorschach with such lack of dramatic display there be so many lousy scene like this that eventually just lose interest in it and just want it to end as for the dark and intelligent remark it be unfortunate but compare to the other dark complex and intelligent superhero movie that come out over the past few year watchmen doesn look all that more special in any way maybe it would but lot have be lose in the delivery with the lack of distinct flavor motif if you may say the lack of an interesting story and fail on its own highlight of story this movie really fail to deliver for me it could have be lot well
i would have love to love this but my god do it not meet any of my expectation don think have ever give 1 to movie on imdb but after read the book be so anticipate see some of the thing ve picture in my mind be visualise on the silver screen none of this happen after see the movie don even know if scarlet play the role of isserley from the book if could review the movie without read the book would have probably give it quite decent vote but at the moment nothing but disappointment sits in my mind about how much possibility be ahead of the screenwriter and this director and how little of that the manage to grab onto after see this movie would recommend either watch the movie or read the book do not combine these activity both be good as separate entity combine them will result in major disappointment
such disappointment 16 year ago pixar animation studio release the first feature length computer animate film in history toy story what follow be an incredible run of success an 11 film hot streak that yield dozen of award include 11 oscars billion of dollar in box office receipt and the admiration of audience and critic everywhere year after year pixar be company you could rely on and while not all the film be perfect they all be at least of decent quality and light year ahead of their competition from the like of dreamworks and sony so therefore it heart break to say that pixar hot streak have come to crash halt in 2011 car 2 be not just the weak film in pixar catalogue it be the bad high profile animate release for some time if there be one pixar film that divide opinion much more than any other it be 2006 car while by no mean bad film it just didn hit in the same way as film like toy story find nemo or the incredibles it do middle number at the box office by pixar standard and currently sit with 74 rating on rotten tomato the only film from the studio below 90 for director john lasseter also head of pixar car be obviously very personal film nostalgic story about the loss small town american value in the face of increase modernity if it not complete success credit must be give to lasseter for at least try to say something meaningful and in typical pixar fashion the film stand out in the increasingly crowd computer animation film market for at least attempt thematic depth and it ability to reach audience both young and old car 2 on the other hand be completely devoid of depth and subtlety and will more than likely annoy adult while at time be arguably inappropriate for child return director lasseter take the bad character from the first film in my opinion the big reason for car failure and structure the whole story around his infuriate exploit imagine george lucas upon see the negative feedback follow the phantom menace make all of episode 2 about jar jar binks that the kind of thing we re leave with in car 2 compound the story problem be the troubling amount of gun and violence in the film to make the argument that it ok because they re just car be inexcusable this be still suppose to be child film and while the espionage sub plot do have potential there be element that seem shockingly unsuitable for young kid this bring up question why would pixar choose to revisit the only film they have produce which could conceivably be call failure lasseter be on record as say that the company would only explore sequel to their film if good story could be develop and the level of quality of the two toy story sequel seem to back up this sentiment but it hard to believe that anyone would think the script of car 2 be worthy of that high standard interestingly there be one other way that car stand apart from other pixar film the estimate 8 billion merchandising revenue while all pixar film have profit from merchandise none have have the global appeal of car it upset to think that pixar company who seem previously to place great importance on the quality of its film than the bottom line have go for the easy cash grab but there really seem to be no other reason for the existence of car 2 everything about the film seem design to increase the potential for sell merchandise whether it the film global location which pander to international audience or the increasingly ridiculous character and set piece tailor make to be toys and video game it a cynical opinion one which have hop d never feel towards pixar film but it be undeniably true car 2 be film create not as an artistic endeavour but to fee ancillary market pixar golden run have to end sometime and one bad film be small price to pay for 11 good with two or three be genuine masterpiece what be most unfortunate be the catastrophic level of car 2 failure and pixar will undoubtedly lose lot of respect for make such soulless film unworthy of the studio name
a great movie with well write character and powerful scene of violence city of god be very violent moving and heartbreaking movie about gang in the slum of rio de janeiro this movie detail how crime affect the people who live in the slum of rio de janeiro rocket have witness violence by both gang and he want out of it but he find that he can escape this movie do great job with make itself look violent think that the main reason why this movie be so hard to watch be because most of the violence be happen to kid it can be hard to watch so many kid brutally die off so young in their life slumdog millionaire do this too but think that this movie do it well because it display violence more brutally with great buildup involve the different backstories be all entertain they be violent well write heartbreaking and even bite funny every now and then they show us how all the tale be all connect to each other this movie be non linear because of that nowadays it hard to find good child actor but many of the actor in this movie carry the movie with expertise most of them be unknown too which make their acting performance even more unexpectedly good this movie give nod to quentin tarantino by feature technique such as time jumping freeze framing and texts it drew inspiration from pulp fiction and goodfellas but this be original in its own way it have its own technique which it feature throughout the film in conclusion this be very well do film it violent and it also have great character and backstories this isn for people who be sensitive but it will appeal to you if you like violence in movie
wildly pointless it be since misson to mar that didn see so wildly pointless movie childish script that as saw from other comment require queer interpretation to try to save the director dialogs that swing between stupidity and ridiculous the one in the hospital and the final one with the brother be the best all the event be gratuitous no background no psychological analysis that justify or explain what happen also the sex scene laughable think this be enough to explain why find this movie really disappointing movie like this one could be define like poor tv movie it doesn deserve the big screen
dull film all round oh dear the frustration of this film be that it should ve be so much good than it be mean look at the cast it get talent in it from top to bottom but they can shake the fact that the plot be thin and it doesn all come together to be anything other than bog standard romantic comedy like john cusack performance but apart from that this didn do lot of me
good but just because it be dark doesn mean its good star war episode 5 the empire strike back tell the story of the evil galactic empire attack the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the death star one thing that feel be worth note right off the bat be that don think this film surpass new hope but be ratter on the same level in term of substance as well as quality what make this film good be that it be able to keep its focus on the character in universe that be so interesting as well as vast that be something that make the original trilogy well in my opinion because in the prequels it be focus on show us heavily g visuals ratter then on the character this be one of many factor that make the original trilogy by far the superior film the plot be also more complex then the first of this trilogy which show that the people involve with this project be take risk the character be all likable and interesting and the fact that they film at real location show dedication from the director irvin kershner the con of this picture though be not minimal which lead me to feel as though it be grossly overrate the acting and dialogue be still hooky the effect be show age the action be underwhelming and unfortunately the fan base that surround star war have make it difficult to watch empire as it be intend the story although complex be occasionally drive forward by plot convinces and although do not see this infamous twist come also be not all that wow in conclusion the empire strike back be complex and have relatable character which be able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertain and m give this one 6 10
the hobbit battle of the dwarf elves orcs human troll giant worm pig goat eagle and anything else that peter jackson think would make money be as irritate as most people when heard that peter jackson would split the hobbit into three movie because it be obviously decision base on nothing more than get as much money as possible but even never imagine that he would stoop to make movie like battle of the five army k battle of the 25 army plus couple of random giant mountain goat and pig thrown in for good measure the cgi be as bad as something you would see in b movie even bad than the previous two hobbit film but even more noticeably the script take dive to rock bottom within the first half hour such utterly laughable clichés as you make me feel alive be speak in cheesy love scene that seem like something straight out of saturday night live except that the audience be apparently suppose to take it seriously shortly before the battle start there be few much need moment of comic relief and think the film might possibly turn around but all my illusion be soon shatter during the ten minute scene where thorin walk on top of the ice that azog be float under with his eye open follow the orc and apparently wait for him to break through it when surprise he do and spoiler for those who have not yet watch the ten minute scene that make this obvious kill thorin ala it might have be sad if hadn be wait around for ten minute know that he would get kill thing be look grim for the dwarf when who should appear our hero the eagle of course who have manage to bail out the protagonist in every single movie of the trilogy although couldn stop laughing during the scene where three dwarf find completely random giant mountain goat with no rider in the middle of the battle and proceed to ride them up mountain the bad part of the movie be easily the end as if the movie isn long enough the audience be not only force to watch bilbo go all the way back to the shire they have to re watch footage from fellowship of the ring know it be bad sign that peter jackson actually make movie shorter than three hour although it felt like six apparently he have so little material for this movie that he have to re use material from his original trilogy when tauriel discuss love with the abominably clichéd line why do it hurt so much think she describe the feeling of most of the audience endure the late hobbit movie

this be bad when you see the dialogue be continuous effort to describe the esoteric world of the protagonist instead of it be express by their act the tension be artificially build up instead of it be naturally generate by the flow of the movie the same cliche dilemma be put on screen again and again instead of them be create in the mind of the audience you know this film be failure not in single moment the director and the writer could make their production be worth of such good material they have in their hand be there something bad than chew food
i try to imagine the iq of the target audience can so cruise be get old yet year after year cgi show him more agile than jean claude van damme in his good day yet this movie script be very particular cruise be show as deserter impersonate an officer now prisoner 1 the prisoner be deliver nice and easy and leave to sleep on pile of luggage 2 the prisoner be deliver in full officer uniform minus the trinket and ornament 3 he be new recruit so he be go in action 4 he be unreliable so he must be part of dangerous mission 5 although mission be prepared and everybody be busy there be not one but three ncos to introduce him to his new life one that notice that cruise have just wake up from his slumber second that take over later on and have some paper on cruise too and third one right behind to carry the effect of the prisoner and this be the good part later the script start make less sense and from all the dialogue the overall idea be something about bow down to your governmental overlord as you alone can take care of yourself
score low on the romance scale be want to see this since it open finally get hubby and his friend to go and they really like it lot but find it trite every trick in the book include kitten object also to the overwhelming theme of woman must have man to be happy that absolutely pervade this film in well draw genre romance the fellow ought be as desirous of mate as be the woman here none of the men she hook up with seem to need her at all and she seem to be unable to be whole without man in her life tuscany be beautiful but we know that
pretty bad history be hop for an accurate war film for change take look at the battle of the bulge for really bad example what spielberg show us in his omaha beach scene make me wonderwhich omaha beach assault he be try to portray those who know little about the battle that almost everyone who in the theater probably now have the idea that every other soldier who land on the beach before noon be either blow to smithereens or badly wound believe me the 1st and 29th division would have be annihilate if itwere as bad as it portray and would never have be able to scale the cliff and rout the enemy by early afternoon which they do wonder for example how wide most viewer think omaha beach actually be in the film it look about couple hundred yard it be in actuality almost ten mile wide the timing be also inaccurate hank go up the cliff at what appear to be 8am nobody make it before 11am another historical error be the implication that the event at omaha be similar to those on the other four assualt beach juno sword gold and utah that totally incorrect utah beach for example the other us assault beach take about dozen casualty many of those due to accident during the land rather than from enemy action but the bad part of the movie be the completely idiotic script here we have the us army send squad squad to march straight thru the entire german 7th army something two division with total air superiority couldn do for week waltz around an area of 300 square mile and expect to find guy name ryan if they want to do any of this nonsense the army would have send them in on the glider that fly into the area the very next morning glider what glider say spielberg that what happen when you have scriptwriter who doesn know very much about his subject stupid stupid film what waste of 100m or so
the movie be okay at best lot of people hat this movie and it not hard to see why the acting be very lackluster noah ringer performance as aang lack the energy and happiness that be see in the show sokka lack his comedic line and kitara whoever play her be freak horrific every time she talk it sound like she be read her line instead of really act speaking of the name they be butcher be it that hard to get their name right the use of slow motion be overuse but still enjoy it some part look really cool to me the movie be guilty pleasure to me watch it the other day on amazon prime and enjoy it the fight scene be entertain and the score be powerful the special effect look really nice except the airbending scene it just look like it be add on at the last minute the thing about this movie be that it stick to the source material some of the time which be sadly lot more than the percy jackson movie and dragonball evolution felt that it be rush it try to fit too much into an hour and half and some really important thing be miss but then again find this movie fairly enjoyable despite its horrible flaws don know guess just find enjoyment in bad movie
bollock this film be entertain but it be also agonize because it be so much bad than it could have be if you re willing to turn off your mind perhaps you win be bother by the preach about totalitarian government or the fact that the script feel like it be author by committee of writer each one wanting to add their own element that pull this movie in about fifteen different direction with no cohesive core other than politically motivated violence this movie try to be way too much and in do so it be simply not plausible can imagine how the scriptwriting go hey let go off on tangent about lesbian great idea high five be exchange let talk about virus for awhile yeah and what if our masked hero be great at cook toast and egg with real butter let show that several time excellent you get the idea it be like zorro with instead of meet batman begin with some not so subtle political undertone lot of shout and script that waste the talent of natalie portman and despite all the heavy hand symbolism and shout you re leave wonder what the point be this film just doesn sit well with me wouldn recommend it except to people who be easily amuse by typical cinematic trash you know who you be or people who just love hear the word bollock

evokes an era most will not care to remember much have already be write about matthew mcconaughey and jared leto astonish transformation and brilliant performance solid and true yes they both deserve enormous accolade golden globe and ampas worthy for these transformation and the effort of their craft but think the true hero of this project be the producer who take chance on such dicey subject matter some review hail the project as crowd pleaser and yet you realise these be truly marginal character and not entirely likable as some have already say in an era 1970s 1980s early aid crisis that be nearly forget in this age of hiv exposure as manage care condition rather than death sentence as it be between 1979 1995 as much as this could be feel good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktail it be compel character study of time of crisis that have not be well capture or document adequately in quite some time bravo to the producer of this movie for give this project the greenlight because the sexually active youth of today would never know the plague and tragedy that precede their coming of age without reminder like this

but why be fan of the marvel universe but honestly deadpool be never my favorite character more and more recent blockbuster filmography be become something friend of mine call product that movie be one big joke with the audience and its intrinsic property of influence or contaminate the one next to you it illustrate what we usually witness around election and how you can pump up mediocrity ryan reynolds do his best to save the movie from itself be both hero and hooligan humor seem so insipid and wear off to the point it be probably bore even at the time the comic book come out guess that contribute to the deadpool persona he be mean to be annoy and he really be the thing that really strike me be the brilliant drama that be very cleverly hint it never reach tip point and that leave me with the impression of real potential sympathize with wade and his childish cynicism as deadpool who despite be invincible be fragile and disgust with the way his life ultimately turn out to be really hope there will be no second movie because it will surely lack the drama and will be strip off its controversy it be interest how sometimes bad movie uncover the real potential and talent of the lead actor
poor the japanese version be excellent however the english dubbed version of this film be beyond disappoint it disgust haku sound like snob and chihiro sound like an annoy brat throughout the whole movie even at the end when she suppose to have grow up they make terrible choice when select the voice over cast especially for chihiro must applaud kamaji voice over who do very nice job along with yababa zeniba the french dub for chihiro be wonderful once again the english one be horrible save yourself and stick to the subbed this one time unless you know french

good act bore story all of the actor in this movie do fabulous job which be not an easy feat since the storyline be so incredibly bore know it be true story but part be fictionalize to make it more interesting can imagine it be much less interesting this type of story have be do many time in the past silkwood and norma rae come to mind don understand why russell crowe be nominate and not pacino think the voter get use to our best actor and actress always do such good job that when young new actor stand out people fall all over them at least when there be two good performance in the same film in summary know this be an important story but it would have be well as tv movie of the week

not good the casting be wrong for elizabeth and darcy keira knightly ooze sex and look like model can believe she would be cast in this role she be all about her look and nothing else which be not right for elizabeth the actor who play darcy must be truly arrogant in real life because that all he project
enjoy show but actually help do enjoy show for entertainment value but ga claim it be do these investigation to help people so help maybe spend less on terrible reenactment and spend 5 minute at the end of show to wrap thing up show always seem to end in the middle of the investigation with someone hearing voice or see something and then zac start narrate over scene from episode and m thinking to myself how can show be over in the middle of this it leave this viewer wonder what happen not only to crew at end of show but also to countless people who call the ga team for assistance
while far from great it be funny and be great to show your ultra liberal friend this film be comedy that combine charles dickens christmas carol with lampoon on michael moore though for legal reason he be call michael malone malone be an america bashing film maker who unknowingly be do the business of al qaeda and it up to the spirit of great american like george patton george washington and trace adkins to help him see the error of his way an american carol be decent little comedy though will be the first to admit that it isn particularly sophisticated or deep it ain shakespeare or merchant ivory production as it direct by david zucker the film play like one of the hot shot film with rapid fire hit and miss joke although it fill with low brow humor that will make people laugh sanctimonious liberal who just can allow themselves to enjoy the film will find it tough go they ll just be too angry to laugh in fact if you do show the film to ultra liberal friend or family member it might just induce stroke or panic attack as the film abound with politically incorrect humor so have paramedic on standby in other word if they see michael moore as fair mind man then they shouldn even bother see this film it could just make their head explode decent act silly script with about as many hit as miss and something decidedly different from the usual hollywood fare this film be worth see for the average person though those who give it 1s or 10s be just too partisan to believe it be not for people who be to the far left and warn them not to watch they just win get it and will take it way too seriously and nothing bad than listen to far leftist once they get angry you know the kind that can laugh at anything just like some on the very very far right
neverending nonsense kid escape from bully by curl up in the attic of his school with book that he come to love so much that it have him in tear the movie may have the same effect on viewer except that it would be tear from boredom the book that it base on be apparently much love so something must have get lose in the translation the story have no rhyme or rhythm it be disjoint uninteresting and unbelievably contrive laughably bad in some part the whiny kid who play the warrior look like little girl and be rather annoy as be the cry baby who be read the book the set be cheesy and the creature be ridiculous look in this utter waste of time

overlooked comedy this be good film which be thoroughly entertain with some snappy dialogue none of the actor have really spectacular film career but in this effort all come to the front of the class with very good performance the cast mix well without doubt this be gabe kaplan best effort even overshadow his tv role as mr cotter
sorry nope sorry but as young man watch friend and stranger live this scenario the two male lead be fictionalized fantasy of the personality of people that would have live through this lose bunch of weight to play role do not make the performance real or live in or stellar don believe the hype of this film it be only film vehicle for people to further their career the lead character don seem to live in or inhabit the true nature of people face their demise instead it seem to be vanity play for accolade and publicity sorry nope this film reflection of this time never happen this be not how real people be conduct themselves this isn how they act this film do not portray their human motivation and emotion accurately this be film that tell dramatic story about time when people die from disease and prejudice and incorrect information be everywhere not proper reflection of the reality l you think be cynical think again the reality witness in the eye of people who be die who scramble for anything to save their life be not portray in this movie this film be nothing more than dramatic story about real time in human history let not hype these performance by the lead as exemplary acting because no person meet in those day ever act like these two lead but if you be director and never meet real people who live this reality and then seek to make an actor vehicle drama you would create character like these character that be neither accurate in their human condition psychological motivation or reality and if as suspect there be some folk involve in this production who do live this reality would bet that when ask if this movie reflect the reality of the time they would answer likely answer no not at all
mostly atmosphere zero story at the end of it all find this movie very bore the story be old as dirt the plot be so obvious that as soon as character appear on screen one can identify he ll be kill she ll be kidnap and use as bait something bad gon na happen to him and my all time favorite he the innocent likable guy introduce early then ignore for 90 minute so we ll forget about him only to have him turn up as hostage in the big showdown and every prediction be spot on example of bad write two thug walk up to door the last thing thug 2 say to thug 1 as they approach the door whatever you do don call him little john very next shot inside the door thug 1 start talk smack and guess what he do when the setup be literally 5 second earlier we all see it come give us the setup in different location maybe or at least disguise the setup amidst longer funny entertain conversation nope just lay out that one line setup then walk on in we the viewer will just deal with it denzel character be likable mean insanely likable beyond the depth of my willful suspension of disbelief likable he always friendly always in good mood always smile he ecstatic just to be alive everyone love be near him he never just guy he more helpful than college professor more inspirational than priest more motivational that fitness instructor every scene in his workplace which be visit repeatedly throughout the movie include no less than 2 background guy smile giddily when denzel arrive to work and laugh loud at every word denzel speak go to work at home depot sorry home mart surely isn like that in real life but there more to denzel isn there who be this guy where he come from who know we ll never know but clearly he bad ass more move than shakira and deadly than seal team six he seem to know how to handle any situation and any number of attacker just because no reason he just awesome if you ever saw the classic comedy planet terror just think of the scene give him the gun give him all the gun because ya know he just so bad as for no logical reason the bad guy be awesome while denzel fight scene be lot of super close blurry shots the few scene where the bad guy establish his badness be rather good very tense very violent and cringe worthy the equalizer have all late bell and whistle with music atmosphere and build up the one female lead be develop nicely especially compare to every other innocent victim who may as well have step out of little house on the prairie much of the movie be very tense and keep you hang on to each scene wait to see what happen next but ultimately we all know denzel will kick as so it all just wait game it felt very long the wait be make so much bad when the viewer know exactly what come there just no surprise here you ve see this movie 500 time m sure oh yeah and denzel know everything he appear magically inside building and room where one shouldn be able to sneak in he have cell phone number one shouldn have access to the character even comment on it how the hell do you get that number no answer doesn matter it a movie just turn off your brain and enjoy the tension build how do denzel know when the bad guy will appear at time and place so he can intercept them in the night don know doesn matter guess how do denzel sneak into closet size room without the occupant notice how do denzel have time to set up his trap rig wire etc without anyone see this work be do who care the resulting death be cool go to sleep tune out enjoy but don expect to take this movie with you you ll have forget it by the time you leave the parking lot
more one for the comic book enthusiasts despite never have read comic book and know very little about the different universe and character have really enjoy most the recent film adaptation however find this film be far close to comic book than the others and didn make for such good standalone film for non enthusiast however must say the animation be good and the music enjoyable
good than insurgent but still no good allegiant be the third film in the divergent series follow on from the rubbish insurgent originally there be mean to be four film in the franchise but this film do so badly at the box office that there talk of the fourth film be tv movie which will be interesting to say the least really don like this franchise at all find it mere rip off of the hunger game which be itself teen friendly rip off of battle royale but the good news be that allegiant be much good than the last film in the series although that doesn make it good insurgent be all about predictability and mindless action whereas allegiant at least have plot of sort even if it isn a very good one the same problem that exist with the first two film be also present here with too much time give over to teen mop around and all of the establish adult star limit to show up intone few line of dialogue and disappear again shailene woodley make for an ultra annoying heroine and hardly someone you can root for the running time be overlong and too much of the story be pad out with scene of character travel around the thing that annoy me be the needless way they throw in cgi shot after cgi shot as if that go to hold the attention the bit where they float about in those giant bubble be the nadir of this film still some of the sub plot be mildly interesting and at least this film appear to be go somewhere which be good than normal for the franchise
the central casting work against this film it possible for one decision to derail movie completely one choice by someone involve in film that just be inherently wrong these decision could be something small like musical score costume design cinematographer or in eran riklis 2012 film zaytoun something big like miscast actor in the form of the seriously un israeli yoni stephen dorff in story that totally hinge on the believability and likability of its two lead zaytoun fail miserably concern the young palestinian boy fahed who we be ask to root for and journey along with actor abdallah el akal do horrible job with his boy act not the right side of endure or not the comical side of rebel it a difficult feat to have child actor take lead in film and make it work and riklis can achieve the feat here with fahed such an unlikeable and uninteresting glue to the film all hope be rest onto hollywood list extraordinaire stephen dorff to move the picture forward but in horrible misjudgement of cast he be doom before single frame be even shot with the plausibility of him pull off be an israeli so impossible that it hard to even fathom why born and breed israeli could not of do the job and do it well it not that dorff be bad perse in his acting just non believable in his role with the failing of the film lead other element of the film do not help its cause with story that sadly can shake the dust of mediocrity and sense of disbelief while riklis as director can add much to proceed other than nice opening shot and some small burst of directional creativity with script overhaul smarter sense of direction and good cast actor you do get the sense that somewhere inside this suppose adventure life affirm tale be good film would be confident in say that not many have hear of this film and it not hard to see why with painfully few thing within zaytoun worth recommend and with cliché story it easy to see why this one sunk like stone even with some advanced hype that suggest award and box office glory miss step for all involved 1 very far from israeli actor out of 5 for more movie review and opinion check out www jordanandeddie wordpress com

capture the true spirit of film noir warn spoiler the seventy be the last year of great american film say film because when we speak of movie nowadays we allude to blockbuster that generate hundred of million of dollar the least amount of controversy and be mostly inane crowd pleaser with tack on ending consider the output of influential film maker allen during that time coppola scorsese altman lumet ashby bogdanovich to name few american not to mention european director fellini bergman wertmuller truffaut argento saura and bunuel all household name in those day before spielberg and lucas come along not single one of these make movie appeal to the summer blockbuster tradition and unlike spielberg or lucas they have body of work fill in high artistic quality with minimum special effect and lasting mark on future generation polanski be another one of these director and with chinatown he reach his directorial peak amidst the scandal which seem to taint everything except his art one can only imagine him in the forty live his scandal and transmute this into high art when film noir be at its dark thankfully he live in time which do not demand the happy end or re shoot in order to be politically correct else chinatown would have lose its devastate punch and conform to the norm departure from the horror genre which bring polanski to stardom he re create an equally grim genre with his jaded view of 1930s los angeles down to the choice of the color palette and use the act power of dunaway and nicholson to fantastic effect he create haunt character who can be easily dismiss as film noir archetype without look very closely at their reaction listen to their word and follow their progressive involvement in plot which threaten to swallow them whole and ultimately do and have huston play noah cross who virtually take noir to its height with the maltese falcon polanski hit the mark dead center because huston be the hardened heart of the corruption in chinatown in brief scene he create character almost unbearably evil with hint of madness just underneath and how he affect the character around him will pervade the viewer long after the credit have roll after all he be the person who tell nicholson he have no idea what he get himself into doubt this movie could be make today for reason state above m thankful polanski vision prevail and not towne film noir be genre about human darkness and here the envelope be push all the way through make this film in my opinion rank second to the maltese falcon
waste of time everybody want some if you re go to do product placement in 70 movie you should use prop that look like they re from the 70s or 80s or whenever this lame hipster movie be pose as wasn even alive back then but even can tell you dr pepper soda pop can look different with big top not like the current can with small head and big body wouldn have even notice if the product placement be so obvious and have as much screen time as it do for time span of at least 5 minute it seem like half the cast and extras walk around in the street be drink nothing but dr pepper out of can from 30 year into the future anyway the film have high production value but no real story it be just series of ultra clean and artificial scene of what someone who as never watch film make in the seventy think the seventy look like you can tell lot of money be put into this film too bad they didn chuck in few dollar more and buy decent script
not perfect but polished and pretty darn great m sucker for any movie that involve close ups of newspaper be print but this story be particularly well told as polish as you would expect from spielberg streep hank and co it be funny and enthralling and just plain solid storytelling in fact spielberg even manage to tone back his over the top ness there be few moment where ode of love to the press could be more important so while there be flaw here in pace and in storytelling device this be as entertain and informative of saturday night as you could ask for
not laugh in the entire movie have now watch this movie three time and have yet to crack smile much less laugh know sound like masochist for subject myself to this punishment but just could not believe popular movie could be this bad assume missed something but every time watch the film it seem bad than the time before absolutely nothing imaginative creative or witty in the entire film except the brief bit with peter dinklage who can actually act everyone else simply embarrass themselves except for farrell who apparently can not be embarrass because he continue to make endlessly lame and boring film and have yet to figure out why people like belushi steve martin and bill murray be funny and he be not pick old gum off rail and put it in your mouth be not funny will wear tights as an overly tall elf be not funny belushi dress as samurai warrior be funny now we have elf plus anchorman talledega night the campaign etc please stop the pain be too great
loss of mystic disturb the movie be very well do and well put together in term of story telling and act for the most part however it lose almost all of the comic book feel that be essential to batman there be no more mystic about the batsuit or the batmobile simply technology this be downside so while this be easily well batman that the previous two batman forever and batman robin it do not carry the character or the legend as well as the original the only other complaint that can offer be the cinematography the shot during almost every fight scene be muddle and it be almost impossible to tell who be who even when one of the character be wear costume like bat m sure that some of this be intentional but the pervasiveness of the technique take lot of the action out of the fighting sequence that aside the cast be stellar and the tone of the movie be well do enjoy the writing and storytelling very much particularly the opening and closing of the film think sequel may be difficult give the amount of time give in this film to the origin of batman but maybe will be surprised
very sweet movie definitely feel good one first saw this on bus return from the kennedy space centre in florida unfortunately by the time the guide get it go we only saw about 45 minute of it before we get back to orlando have enjoy it immensely and want to see how it turn out fortunately over 12 month later sky get around to show it and be delight that it be as sweet as remembered m usually bit of cynic with family movie but this have such nice feel about it and on miserable british winter day it be great tonic have often wonder what have happen to steve guttenburg and he turn in nice performance as do kathleen quinlan the kid be good too not sickly sweet and nauseating as some movie kid be as for the comment about the kid with the goth look you have no clue about teenager she come across as typical one the animal be good too and all in all it be nice easy to watch movie and d rather watch it 10 time than have to sit through big momma house 2 and it ilk just the once 7 out of 10
unnerve silence quiet place very quickly become one of my most anticipated film of the year have like emily blunt lot in other thing have lot of appreciation for the genre and absolutely adore the concept one of the year best concept and one of the most brilliant and unique for any film see it quiet place turn out to be one of my favourite of the year too its positive critical reception more than deserve can understand though if it doesn work for others it be not film that everybody will enjoy with its deliberate pace very sparse use of music and dialogue and heavy reliance on atmosphere have see many film recently that have waste good potential and idea or not quite fulfil them so it be refresh and bless to have such brilliant and unique concept execute in way that be equally brilliant and as film unlike any other see by me be far too transfix by the atmosphere and mood to criticise quiet place for lack of logic plot hole have never criticise film for plot hole find it lazy and unfair criticism especially when it the only thing mention in review that list them and say nothing about the film overall quality or not make complete sense when film doesn transfix or engage me it be less forgivable but quiet place be utterly transfix from start to finish from personal view it a beautifully make film with lot of style and atmosphere not everybody will like that the use of dialogue and music be sparse that wasn a problem for me in fact it be appreciate and it work really well actually think it be the right thing to do without constant music the concept and atmosphere come through strong if the music be intrusive obvious or repetitive they would not have work anywhere near as well without constant dialogue it let the actor expression and body language do all the talk have see horror sci fi film and film in general actually recently that have suffer from too much talk and exposition that it bog the pace down and it even more of problem when the dialogue isn good or interesting appreciate hugely that quiet place didn go down that route luckily the act benefit from have little dialogue here it a masterclass of expression speak louder than word emily blunt be simply sensational in very move and expressive performance that be among her best millicent simmonds and noah jupe also impress in beyond their year performances that one doesn actually expect from actor so young so do john krasinki in performance just as expressive in subtle way and charismatic in the director chair he show lot of confidence and great talent for mood and storytelling especially good about quiet place be the atmosphere which smoulder from every frame and shape every part of the story the pace be deliberate slow burn but for me it be never dull part of quiet place be heartfelt others be quirky but above all it genuinely scary and unnerving enhance by tremendous use of sound design that generate unbearable tension the monster be incredibly nightmarish actually take lot for me to feel unsettled after watch film since get old quiet place do that for me overall superb film and one of my favourite of the year so far 10 10 bethany cox
great music beautiful visuals just like many people here heard great story about this movie expect way well movie and be quite disappointed the storyline be empty and doesn really get you anywhere the reason why this movie stay on my mind be mainly because of the music the feeling think they want to create didn get to me through the movie itself but through the music the visuals cinematography be be great which make it for me still pleasant movie to watch in the end but definitely not because of the storyline although be go to keep listening to the music definitely don want to watch this movie ever again
possibly the bad film ever see this be painful to watch maybe like fine wine this movie will get well with time but as 24 year old at the time have little use for this slow how slow do radium decay painful melodrama
alexander with such an epic story you would think someone like stone would produce an epic film from the random accent of the character specifically have no idea what jolie be try to do to some pretty atrocious act from farrell he capable of much good but this be at the height of his grandiosity and ego there be so many moment where it feel like the film be onto something only to have it stop and spin off into another pointless direction bottom line 155 mil film about alexander the great should have be iconic but alexander fall flat on its face from the weight of the ego involve
decent drama weak horror the unique setting be refresh and it be interest to see the protagonist struggle with be suffocate by familial societal and even supernatural pressure but the horror aspect be much weak than review lead me to believe don think it have any tension effective scare unless you count be startle by noise or even strong plot the big flaw be the reason for the protagonist entire motivation for stay seriously if someone try to pitch me that idea would tell them to try harder by the time the daughter scream for her doll for what felt like the 50th time could only think about how would have tap the thing to her hand to stop her nonsense don get me wrong don mind drama or social commentary in my horror film in fact those topic can often add complexity and dimension this however be not enough horror to be horror film but with too much horror to be family drama
great depth you must watch 2 3 time to get it despite the undoubtedly awesome aesthetic the smooth photography great tom cruise and an even great andrea riseborough the movie have actually fantastic plot there be plenty of hint around the movie in time that you will not get them but will shape you feel you will not be able to understand the movie depth be great you will need to watch it 2 3 time to fully understand look word or even slight move in the first 3 minute that actually give big hint about what be happen around finally in lot of scene but also in general there be plenty of message opinion have to do with modern people way of live ps the music be fantastic it connect superbly with every scene best movie in 2013 for me
omg this have to be one of the bad movie in history terrible act screenplay cgi and plot be there even one and to make it bad they clearly try to rip off the fast and the furious with wash up dmx horrible simply horrible avoid this at all cost
a good movie for the vapid dirty dancing be plot lack the acting be horrid and the dialog be absolutely pathetic m sorry to hurt any true fan of the movie but after be tell how wonderful it be be completely let down will say one nice thing about it the dancing be nice guess
bad movie really rating this crap 8 2 10 its really true that mass be stupid sat in the cinema after long day try to stay glue to this movie and find myself dose off its really lame movie firstly don like the way superman just appear in suit and ka boom there he be ready to save the world at the same time cause mass demolition of skyscraper and and building and anything that get in his way when fight an enemy be like seriously do this superman or man of steel or whatever you want to call him think this city be desolate like in resident evil or what seriously this movie be an insult to our commonsense of what hero be suppose to be as much as we check our intelligence at the door when go to what action movie superheroes in particular this movie just go too far that it would really appeal to people with severe deficit in their iq it seem like it be transformer at one point really bore one of those movie you never need to watch again the way it end do not even offer promise prospect for continuity
a spark call pacino it be so freshening and attractive to see his majesty mr al pacino in this breathtaking movie of 1970s the first thing that discern eye would notice throughout the film be the undying uniqueness of pacino originality this be just another movie destine to reassure viewer of al status of an icon the movie itself be endear and entertain though the movie be suppose to appear like bank rob and in sense it be but deep in the heart robbing be simply way to achieve totally different goal of course other than money it be about affection and mutual caring it about what situation person be ready to embark into in order to show how much he care for another one and guess this be the point of the whole movie which be stylistically decorate with doze of sarcasm and pleasantry with sporadic undertone of bravery the character be all innocent which innocence seem to relate them to each other what deem as very courageous here be the thematic element homosexuality guess the time when the movie be make the society have still be rule by prejudiced mentality that could really ruin this innocuous piece of art for this praise the very daring sidney lumet one of my favorite director 10 10
loooooong and fizzle when my husband flip contact on last night ask have we see this before he say that we have but at first it didn ring any bell for me then suddenly they start resound ummm doesn this have really rotten end ask about 45 minute into the movie he couldn remember but as we meander painfully through this long drawn out stereo typical behemoth become even more convinced that the reason didn really remember see this before be because it be so beautifully forgettable one of the most important thing with any piece of writing be that it start well and finish in way that be satisfy that doesn mean that every loose end need to be tie up but that the viewer reader be leave with sense that their journey have come to an acceptable conclusion contact start relatively well flow sluggishly from there on and finish with fizzle wasn particularly look for alien or revelation of god just an interesting compelling story m still look everyone be different but the possibility be that you will either love contact or hate it there doesn seem to be much middle ground

less than worthy follow on to the first two film part of me want to see matrix revolution simply to see the conclusion of the trilogy for that reason alone would have see it but another part of me want to movie simply to be good it fulfil the former how could it do otherwise but it be less than successful on the later the first half hour be unnecessarily draw out exposition with little intrigue or twist to keep you engage here the twin from matrix reload would have be welcome and familiar diversion but by the time the action start be way too antsy and ready for something the next hour or so be almost overload for the me it felt more like an over the top video game than an action movie the swirl movement of literally thousand of real world machine be incredible but because of their sheer number you could never focus on any one thing for too long keep think more about what impressive computer they use to create the scene than in the plight of the zion inhabitant by contrast to the approach george lucas use in the star war film where he keep cut between action along several front think the climatic battle in return of the jedi and the phantom menace this one remain tightly focus on one for what be for me too long some might say this give each conflict its due for me it be too much without breather in the end the resolution be less than satisfy neo encounter with the embodiment of the source remind me more of the john ratzenberger voice school of fish in find nemo than anything else and his final encounter with agent smith cause more chuckle than ooohs m not sure that what they intend and though understand the finale to trilogy like this might prefer to leave many specific unspecified would ve liked broad glimpse of the world as it be at the film conclusion wish could rate it high but can this be movie that will only be of interest to fan of the first two without have see them the story worthless and for those that enjoy the first two this be must see anyway go watch don expect too much other than eye pop computer graphic at warp speed
very soap operish this film while not bad but be just cringe soap opera alike yes it have some good moral but the cheesyness ruin it
just terrible it not often that call movie terrible but this be terrible and it too bad because it could have be good and lindsay lohan be really quite good in it it just seem like movie suffer from an identity crisis try to be film noir psychological thriller and gross out horror flick it be just way overdone and there be too many hole in the plot the use of the blue rise petal be so heavy hand and if all that weren enough figure out who the killer be almost from the first moment the character be introduce poor lindsay all in all she not have very good week well luck next time if there be one for lindsay
mediocre but good special fx and comedy aside from johnny depp quirky performance always worth watch this be pretty lame attempt at action comedy the special effect be of course competent and the camera work be good but the writing and plot be thin and amateurish perhaps should not have expect more give that it just disney sfx vehicle with bankable lead but think this fell far short of the hype the apparent premise that some of them be dead and curse to go on and on it seem to change somehow toward the end as if no one be sure what the rule really be it set up of course for sequel probably even lame than this one wouldn have mind if hadn pay four buck to see the thing on pay per view but guess wrong on this one

end lose me despite the unexplained end the film be pretty solid like the plot and it have some great act it have very small cast and most of the movie be film inside of bar proving that you don need huge budget and large cast to make good movie just wish the end be explain there be no clarification on who jimmy thompson be or why he put hit on the bartender leave us lose in the end either way still think this film be worth watch 6 star

do not rate the hype it have receive after see the obl movie that national geographic hype and be extremely poor have hop this would be much good be wrong yes more money be spend on this movie with good actor director script edit etc however the movie be nowhere near as factual as claim wrong equipment add character fatten the story with trivial embellishment create situation that never happen change the story to what they want it to be just ruin this movie obl be take to carrier in the arabian sea prove to be obl then he be bury in the arabian sea there be more inventive people and scene in this movie however over time it have prove to be more accurate than the other movie yes it be well
self medication mr spielberg this movie serve two purpose glorify the american soldier from world war ii and the american nation in general and help mr spielberg overcome his own neurosis about be jewish task he start with schindler list that probably make him the envy of anyone who ever saw psychologist to get pay for spread out your psyche instead of have to pay for it the first 20 minute of this movie be amaze indeed very well capture be the sheer horror of land on fortified beach the disorientation the kill etc but after that this movie drop on the level of armageddon mother have number of son all of them die during the war except one and the us military surely put the life of half dozen soldier into peril to save that last one of course that be completely logical the german soldier in the contrary don seem to have mother or anyone who care about them they be ugly lean mean kill machine shout incomprehensible thing and should be kill wherever possible they be also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on battle field they don have any feeling at all so what could have be great movie with all the money spend for and star on it play in the same league as all quiet on the western front get to be completely pathetic unrealistic super patriotic and one side steven spielberg once say that he often didn feel he be real american and be leave out because of him be jewish and that the past of his family haunt him it be ok to feel that way and wish him he will finally get rid of both feeling but on the other hand he also be leave out of get an oscar until schindler list that be well do movie but on the long run it seem it didn do spielberg too good somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that do movie about wwii help him overcome his problem and make them patriotic will help him get an oscar if you be interested in realistic look on war watch all quiet on the western front or das boot
a great musical the song be fantastic and the story line be good like many other act school mine also produce hair for most hair production it a golden opportunity to do nude but my production be fully dressed don think full frontal nudity in movie or play guarantee artistic quality and so do the creator of the movie the movie version be great with classic hit follow each other while let the plot develop to the chill climax great cast of actor dancer and singer
quality humor overshadow by poor story find deadpool to be somewhat of disappointment like many be psyched to see what could be do with an rat superhero movie and it definitely have its merit the constant crude humor and comic reference make it bearable for superhero lover and perhaps enjoyable if one be willing to pull the wool over their eye and not engage in the meat of the movie the plot basic love story which fail miserably in get one to care for the character portray there be weak bond make with the audience and the lead character we find ourselves find negasonic teenage warhead the only engage character in the entire film the others be too abstract and annoy for the majority of the time not what be hop for story too weak to fully be content with it as anything other than token rat superhero film
the movie equivalent of self indulgent blog the rise of blog have create culture in which every tom dick and harry be able to make every minor inconsequential thought that pop into his head know to the entire world and consequently convince him and perhaps some of his reader that what he have to say be far more important than it be the blog culture be also responsible for movie like eat pray love pointless movie about an affluent privileged woman quest to find herself which really mean eliminate from her life anything resemble responsibility and go off to enjoy everything that cliché and trendy about world culture eat lot of good food in italy meditating in india etc think people should be free to do whatever they want with their life provide they don hurt other people along the way and if they have the free time and the money to go travel around the world do nothing more power to them but what ask in return be that they not then bore me with all of their whining about vague problem or think they re inherently interest when they re come to life conclusion the rest of us come to when we be twenty five the character play by julia robert doesn make lick of sense because robert be far too confident screen presence and not nearly good enough actress to make us understand what this woman problem be it certainly not money or lack of free time since she spend all of the movie run time lounge around italian cafe and beach in bali look like photo spread in travel magazine the gorgeous scenery be appeal for while but certainly not enough to warrant running time of 2 25 as far as can tell her real problem seem to be men which be represent by handful of recognizable and wasted actor billy crudup james franco javier bardem and only one of whom richard jenkins have chance to build anything resemble character of consequence unfortunately jenkins be such good actor and his character problem so much more significant and real than robert that he only serve to make us more intolerant of her blathering
very innovative watch this movie multiple time and really enjoy it when be young however the rating dip bit as got old now there be some imagery in here that be very symbolic the script be very witty and well craft the story innovative the visual effect amaze the story be incredibly original and even have interesting twist however what be lack be the deepening of the protagonist relationship feel that in order to buy into the premise this movie need to prove that their love be soecial enough to start again even after delete each other but somehow it just doesn work well enough now maybe the idea be that they be just flaw people in flawed relationship but feel that more time could have be give to this by for instance cut out the moronic scene of jim carrey as baby that seem only as vehicle for him to use his non verbal comedy chop
overcome the first hour and you ve get solid film there be two part in fair game one of which last far long than the other this part be how the film open and despite be humorous and light in tone it isn anywhere near as entertaining as be hop the film would be after survive the first part of the film get to the second and be thrill to finally get some excitement from the film that isn to say the first half be bad it just wasn anything like be expect market although barely market at all as political thriller the majority of the film isn that at all ll admit that set up the scenario and character be nice but do it in somewhat confusing and overlong way hurt the finish product the first part of the film do decent enough job at set up the story we meet our two lead our antagonist but we don get much in term of thrill we find out that valerie plame naomi watt be cia agent and that she be far more ruthless than she first appear she know how to get the information that she want and she utilize this technique whenever it be require we also meet her husband joseph wilson sean penn who be or be an ambassador from the united state he be send to niger not to be confuse with nigeria as the film tell us to find out if it be possible that iraq be buy thing that would make them able to build nuclear weapon he discover that it wasn and return home with his report valerie be do her own research regard this and talk with many different people in iraq promise them safety in return for information what just explain take well over an hour for the film to show and that a shame because it do feel like it drag on for too long the second part involve deceit on the part of the government and joseph attempt to clear his family name the government decide to completely disregard joseph report and declare that valerie be in the cia something that be apparently not good when say agent be undercover it be in the second half with joseph fight for his family freedom the tension create from lie government and the emotional change in the character we have get to know when the film start kick into high gear prior to this point there be some amusement in the light hearted nature of the film there be joke particularly humorous be one regard the toronto maple leaf but there isn much actually go on once the second half begin thing really start to spiral out of control for valerie and joseph their marriage start come apart they be receive death threat daily the entire country seem to have turn against them thing be go wrong and since there be such large build up to this point of the film we care about what be happen to our character when thing start head south we be sadden by it this be also help out by great performance by watt and penn who be appear together in their third film the previous film be 21 gram and the assassination of richard nixon watt play her character incredibly seriously and it work shockingly well she mean business and it be apparent right away penn be more relaxed despite have the weight of the world on his shoulder for some of the film the story be actually base on real event detail in valerie plame memoir fair game my life as spy my betrayal by the white house how true the movie stay to what actually happen m not so sure it would likely be best to not assume that the film be entirely truthful as with most film liberty have to be take to make the film compelling for the audience it would be ignorant to believe that the film be entirely truthful so if you decide to watch fair game keep that in mind not be entirely familiar with politics american politics in particular m not sure as to how much it deface one side or the other but there be certainly some badmouth go on would almost think that have film base almost entirely on american politics would make the film less interesting for those not knowledgeable about the subject but thankfully this doesn happen the film be still overall fairly enjoyable even if politics aren your forte have it not be for slow and somewhat confusing open hour fair game would have be an excellent film the beginning be its only real problem with everything else be top notch the acting performance be great the story be interest once it get go and you do begin to care about the character the set up do its job establish the character and set but it isn engage enough to keep the audience attention push past it though and you ll get great final act with tension suspense and most importantly entertainment
a pretty ordinary film with few highlight not sure what all the fuss be about yes it do have some good moment particularly the flashback but generally the storyline be unconvincing and rather too convenient one man with dog survive alone for three year in deserted city strive to save mankind by find cure for deadly virus fight infinite number of zombie build his mansion into fortress that even george bush would envy broadcast message on be radio and yet have the time to hunt deer in the city and practice drive golf ball oh come on then he flip out and be rescue by brazilian accompany by child who she claim be follow message from god naaahhhhhhh sorry enjoy the film to point but would not bother watch it again would also run against some other review and say that quite frankly that will smith have do well or maybe the story need different type of character
they could grab it by the husk king arthur and his knight of the round table set out on quest to find the holy grail as told to do so by cartoon god that live in the cloud easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever make monty python and the holy grail claim it undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situation and character that will very likely never be duplicate pure comedic genius that doesn go stale with age or decade of competition have be release simply see the way comedy film be make today this film will very likely have long reign before anything can even hold candle to it an absolute belly laugh fest that never let up only the cast of monty python could have pull this film off with each actor play many different character all hilarious the genius in the actor line themselves be truly to be admire the comedic style of talk in circle be one technique that most comedy do not try to do simply because they can compete with the genius of this film which use it flawlessly those that do try usually fall flat on their face two particularly excellent example of this can be see in the beginning scene in which the character discuss the origin of coconut and the other when lancelot break into the swamp castle to save the damsel in distress this be merely one technique that the cast have perfect to conjure up laugh consistently throughout the entire film the only way that can imagine that someone might not like this film be if they simply do not enjoy it type of humor too bad for them another hilarious technique use in the film be the use of comedy in the background from people slam cat against pole for no apparent reason to people fill up basket with mud in the field all very strange and hilarious at the same time it also simply amaze that all of the character be play by the same group of actor which show the great range all of them have some be simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes take good eye to pick them out which make it fun and don want to ruin it for anyone but this film take some turn that no sane person could see come ridiculous character in ridiculous situation equal ridiculous laughter the epitome of all star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time kudos to gilliam and the rest of the python crew if you haven see it yet make it your first priority in life

it could be good wish really wish like it well mean know from the synopsis that it not that much original or innovative storyline but yet still have hope for it it be still good because of the duration it not drag but think it could be good the element be just way too familiar and therefore felt like nothing new be present by the movie must say it feels little bit of alice in the wonderland and then some other fairy tale at the other scene like hey it remind me of moment keep happen to me think at least there be anything new but there none the character also be not so memorable mean can get grasp of their personality but there be nothing like impressive it like each character personality be adopt from some other character produce before in another movie m sorry but really think it could be good or m just not the target audience for this movie maybe

song for great hall before peter jackson adaptation of the lord of the ring trilogy the world of high fantasy have not be particularly well serve by cinema the genre be not even really take seriously in literature until the 1960s during the 80s there be fad for fantasy movie but while most of these looked nice and be good enough fun none of them really have magnificence although the 1981 excalibur movie come pretty close it be not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema rather delay come of age as with the first two movie in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay be exceptional there a lot more action and lot less dialogue in this one and yet the plot be still clear and the narrative never feel repetitive the idea of bind the various story line together in time such as when the witch king arises near frodo and sam but the tower of green light be see mile away by pippin be great for build up the tension they also really help to establish this vision of middle earth as real place with vast dimension and again jackson prove himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence at first glance his work seem very much aim at those with short attention span but there be so much load into each and every shot the camera follow an orc as he fall to the ground or come to rest upon woman hold baby as panic erupts in the city his horror ting imagining of certain scene be truly unnerving there be some all round improve acting in this instalment perhaps the year wrap up in the production be take the necessary toll on the cast there be some truly heartfelt moment from bernard hill and wonderfully spirited turn from miranda otto for me billy boyd always stand out as the finest of the hobbit performer and this be the movie where he come to the forefront demonstrate great dignity and emotion the best performance however as previously belong to ian mckellen as gandalf there something strangely know in his final scene one of the unfortunate thing about the return of the king be that it suffer bad than the first two movie from lack of dignity at certain time the cgi gollum be too cutesy and it hard to believe in him as an antagonist although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly transform smeagol bite into fish with andy serkis in prosthetics would have be perfect for the whole thing some of the most serious bit become silly remember laugh out loud in the cinema when gandalf say so passes denethor when the man be still pathetically run around in flame but by and large this be an exceptional production with its most outstanding touch in the way the whole thing have be put together when the beacon be lit stretch line across mountain range it do in such smooth rhythmic way we be simultaneously impress by the immense scale the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as mean of communication when pippin haunting song continue in the background as the men of gondor ride off to their doom we feel the depth of what be go on in way the image alone could not impart this be the kind of thinking you don see in those numerous 80s fantasy movie or in sci fi big trilogy star war the lord of the ring movie put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story for me with great weight than tolkien himself achieve it elevate this above be merely another cgi action flick and grant the fantasy genre status and stature it have never enjoy before

i have see this film read about the comic long time before saw the film and be intrigue about how it would be handle on celluloid england be run by totalitarian regime some time in the future the leader of the regime be play by john hurt who fittingly play the role of winston smith in michael radford version of 1984 the author of the graphic novel the film be base on apparently walk out of the premiere of the movie and can see why the director of for vendetta obviously have great love of the comic because he do try to deal with the issue that be raise in the comic but his ineptness as director let the comic down badly among the issue be how fear cause by terrorism can allow the public to be manipulate by politician who then push through draconian law which they claim to be for the good of the people but be actually cover darker ulterior motives the editing be cringingly bad it really make you wonder if there be director behind the production at all the lead natalie portman and hugo weave rush their way through script that clunk and grind along for most of the movie the relationship between portman and weave character be totally implausible because there be not even hint of gradual development of portman trust in who be after all quite dubious character give that he wear mask the whole time that you re expect to believe in the dodgy london english accent should know since be bear and breed londoner add to the farcical catalogue of other thing that make this bad film actually get quite angry about this one because the subject matter be topical and raise lot of question but it could have be handle so much good by more accomplished director
it satire people have to say be shock and how many bad review have see on this site for this movie it seem to me that the majority of moviegoer who have choose to review here be only capable of view movie at face value this movie be clearly satirical look at hollywood and the constant need to remain relevant in the entertainment industry will admit that the film do appear unnecessarily artsy in place but some hollywood actor love be unnecessarily artsy as they think it give them depth that be the entire point of this film for hollywood to turn the camera on itself and expose all of it own crap what take from this film be what have always felt about hollywood which be also what love about it actor be inherently insecure which be why they choose to be in an industry where there be need for constant approval the actor who be worth their salt risk everything to entertain us for that they will forever have my respect definitely worth watch and worthy of it best picture oscar

a dull thriller that lack both originality and credibility eagle eye come with story that seem all too familiar and uninspired for thriller movie that be release in 2008 that say it be likely that its plot will remind the viewer of handful of thriller that he or she might have see before and the viewer will eventually realize that all of these thriller be release five to ten year prior to eagle eye for me it generally felt like watch remake of the 1998 thriller enemy of the state of course it would be remake that be do pretty sloppily and its plot would prove to be far more preposterous the visual appearance of eagle eye and many of its trope follow suit thus the feeling of originality plunge to the low possible level after just few minute of watch an additional source of annoyance be the frequent use of the shaky camera which rarely find to work well as stylistic device the character seem chronically underdeveloped and give me the impression that have see them in dozen of thriller and other movie from the aforementioned time span there be some lengthy car chase but none of them prove to be really exciting and the reason behind them be pretty obscure at the end of the day all that could remember from these sequence be the image of countless vehicle be wreck in an utterly cartoonish fashion finally there be quite few occasion when the character banal behavioral pattern and opinion make me chuckle with their lacking credibility certainly be support by the fact that the performance turn out to be fairly mediocre throughout the movie
green book this film prove why movie can be so powerful with touch poignant and some time funny story of opposite attract enjoy every moment although it isn always easy to watch mortenson and ali shine and there be strong support role as well

have the same pro and con as the first movie in short unexceptional but watchable be not sure which of the two be well so be go to say that in my eye this sequel be on the same level as its predecessor albeit with one improvement neither movie be as good as the timeless tv show or the wonderful chipmunk adventure but in many way more than one both be cute and harmless movie without try to be 5 star masterpiece alvin and the chipmunk the squeakquel have con that be similar to its predecessor as with the first the film be very predictable with some clichéd human character and situation though in fairness lot of animated live action film do have that problem as well also it do have some hit and miss in the script with some joke that parent might groan at the film be rather short and rush as well fault aside the film do have an improvement the performance of jason lee as david in the first he be miscast and out of his depth here he be much more comfortable and relaxed visually and technically have little to fault it either the photography and editing be crisp without be award worthy the location work be quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunk again be spot on be very cute the chipmunk be adorable with voice that be thankfully not irritate and as with the first alvin and the chipmunk the squeakquel nail the personality of the chipmunk theodore again be the best realised and the soundtrack be very catchy with tuneful melody and sweet lyric which kid will love and adult will possibly tolerate too overall unexceptional but watchable family entertainment 6 10 bethany cox
typical disney this be typical disney goodie two shoe stuff big on stereotype and happy ending star cast of nobody and produce only to make money with no message no substance and no dramatic value disney grind out adult movie like sausage under its touchstone brand name really be the great satan this follow one of maybe five basic touchstone plot thats what happen when accountant be turn loose make movie but have say that it an entertaining enough 90 minute with some nice italian atmosphere have to balance my love of italy with my loathe for disney give it 5 which probably be generous
this movie desperately need whatever they edit out it be an ok movie all in all but it could ve be so much good be personally stoke for horror mutant movie but this be as much horror as any other superhero movie and less than some so must say be very disappointed the idea of be there and it could ve be so so good but in the end it wasn a thing that really distract me be the actor weird accent you have group of really good actor here but the bad accent make them just seem mediocre
the book win again have read the fabulous into thin air by jon krakauer be excite to see poster around london promote the film the trailer certainly guarantee spectacular trip and the promise of 3d only add to my excitement watch the film last night but be sad to report that the film as be often the case fail to live up to the standard of the book those that have read into thin air will find the main protagonist be change serious omission of the danger of the climb but more unforgiving omission of the sequence of coincidental event that lead up to the fatal tragedy the movie fail miserably in create any emotional connection with the character jon character make largely insignificant scott fischer be portray as young hippie and beck as nothing more than loud mouth arrogant american with an estranged relationship with his wife this lack of emotion ultimately set the film up to fail as many of the protagonist meet their end there be no shock and little empathy perhaps none would be create if the movie have not start off by confirm it be base on true event the use of 3d effect be minimal which be real shame as felt this type of movie would have have great potential there be few jolt moment and the ascent to everest be portray as fun and easy rather than harrow and arduous all in all film still worth watch in the cinema but best to keep expectation very low this be neither documentary nor an action adventure

a family comedy that doesn work if you be about to ask me what possess me in see zookeeper my answer would be curiosity at first wasn sure whether wanted to see zookeeper the cast in general didn appeal to me apart from nick nolte and rosario dawson and the trailer in the cinema when go to see harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 have me cringe when eventually drag myself to see zookeeper be overall very unimpressed be it the bad movie of the year not quite that would be either big momma 3 river of darkness or spy kid 4 but it be low on my film saw in 2011 list know zookeeper be family movie get that but in my book just because it a family movie doesn automatically mean it a good movie just for the record love family movie some of my favourite be family movie such as disney pixar movie like the wizard of oz the secret garden little princess chitty chitty bang bang et black beauty and the black stallion zookeeper just isn my idea of good family movie that all love family movie that touch you and reach out to the child within you and also one that appeal to wide audience of course zookeeper isn that type of movie but family movie can also entertain admit raise smile once or twice mainly because of bernie the gorilla and the movie didn make me cringe as much as its trailer do but overall zookeeper just didn entertain me firstly the writing be pretty much mess not only be the script poorly write and vast majority of the gag predictable and cringe worthy but to me the humour would go over the head of most kid and adult would find it childish the storyline be also incredibly predictable and while some of the final act felt rushed lot of it because of the humour not work felt dull not only that it be very unoriginal not always problem but seriously just how many time have we have the dr doolittle talk animal idea do like some of the scenery and the animal do look great the editing however could ve be much tight the music be forgettable and doesn always fit with the mood and the direction be plod and unfocused do wish there be good news about the acting but sadly no be not fan of kevin james though wasn go to let that spoil the movie experience however because his character so clichéd and material so weak james try too hard and overdo it badly rosario dawson be pretty much waste in thankless role the animal be in way more interesting than the human they look fine and their material somewhat funny voice work be more problematic some do decently but some grate fast adam sandler and maya rudolph be incredibly irritate while sylvester stallone sound bored cher try her best but her character be not among the most interesting the best and the only one really do like be nick nolte as bernie overall messy and doesn work in my opinion 2 10 bethany cox
for god sake who approve this script m try to swallow this movie but so far just couldn i will be brief because this thing don deserve more than few line from me first the acting be poor from the beginning to the end the character be flat and history doesn make any sense on the real world know that this be movie base on game and may not expect too much but this movie be catastrophe there be several dramatic scene that should make you feel something about the character but you don feel nothing at all specially because everyone of the dramatic sequence be fallowed by an unrealistic and illogical event you have to watch it to understand the race be bore the action on the movie be kind of lazy you feel like there be lot of ultra expensive car run at 40 mile per hour and parkinson guy hold the camera so if you want to get big disappointment watch need for speed if you don believe me and want to watch this pearl make something as you watch do the math and calculate the profit you will know what mean when you finish the movie
it hasn age all that well slow pulpy and sometimes off put often hail as classic of the gangster genre perhaps get carter 1971 be groundbreaking initially because of its cold and callous depiction of both its central character and the criminal he essentially call his co worker it hasn age too well though with many misogynistic moment and general poor treatment of woman come up too often to be consider just unfortunate by product of its time it be also incredibly dull attempt to be slow burn thriller but instead just be slow there be proper nastiness to the picture pulpy heart beat underneath its calm and collect exterior but this often come across as ever so slightly glamorise even if carter himself isn really consider hero it in its seedy side that it find its most success and somewhat paradoxically its most failure while there a sense of violence beget violence and criminality spreading to even the most innocent like corrosive virus there also sense that the movie revel in its depiction of these element especially those that concern its female character even as it condemn them to bizarre and often off put result its big issue however be that it isn ever entertaining
a future cult series the expanse be not an easy series to start the first couple of episode be slow because there be lot of world building to do and character to present that can throw off lot of people but if you keep watch the series show everything one can hope in sci fi and space opera series also realize that the first slowest episode be much well in re watch when you know the character and what be go on the first season be more paused space opera but in the 2nd season the brake be off the stake be high and its be an even more awesome show the 5th chapter of 2nd season home be one of the best chapter in the history of sci fi without doubt the series follow several mayor character across the solar system miller burn out cop search for miss girl in cere in the asteroid belt avasarala ruthless earther politician who want to stop possible war between earth and mar holden the 2nd officer in an ice hauler who see himself in situation he never saw come later more character join the plot with the same level of importance like bobbie the martian marine fred johnson tycho station head project and one of the opa leader and lot of other complex character the plot and character at first feel disconnect and random but when the series develop you realize they they fit incredibly well the special effect be top notch with some incredible gorgeous shot and and incredible attention to detail that show in how smartly they use real physic in way that be almost character and plot in itself the acting be great for the most part specially thomas jane who simply nail it in way that make miller one of the most compelling and charismatic character in tv in long time so to summarize great plotgreat charactersstuning special effectsgreat use of real physicshard to follow at the beginning but with great payoff latergreat re watch valuethe series be gon na be cult series mark my word

i still don get it saw this movie for the first time when be still pre teen because one of the girl know from school an old teenager be obsess with it didn get it back then saw this movie again in my late teen and didn get it then either watch it again the other day and still don get it don understand what all the fuss be about it unremarkable bore predictable monotonous and thoroughly mediocre as if that wasn enough it also manage to be offensive to boot the plot be disgustingly predictable and uninspiring the dialogue horrendous there be zero chemistry between the lead actor in fact it be quite apparent that they can stand each other speaking of character they be all highly unlikeable johnny obnoxious arrogant self absorb one dimensional hole baby obnoxious arrogant self absorb one dimensional slag and it actually quite disgust that patrick swayze who seem to be in his mid 30s be sleep with girl 15 20 year his junior grant she be slapper but be this movie make to glamorize child molester or underage hooker don get me wrong do like lolita where the same be happen but it expect and actually quite tastefully do but this be just creepy and disturb it just my opinion but think one must be slightly retard to refer to this utter disgrace as masterpiece
witty and thrill summer blockbuster with tom cruise in top form you could describe this movie as dizzy combination of groundhog day starship trooper source code and the butterfly effect edge of tomorrow borrows from these film and while some of the individual idea may not therefore be groundbreakingly original the way they re combine and put to use in edge of tomorrow by director doug liman certainly be as alien have invade earth humanity only hope lie in cowardly pr officer bill cage play by tom cruise with no combat skill who be send to the front line his only advantage save point sort of be you excited yet you should be don want to tell you more specific about the plot because it best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself you have to love tom cruise as an actor he always give his role 100 percent and he phenomenal in edge of tomorrow physical funny and determined d say this be his best performance since collateral emily blunt be fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war rita vrataski this be her first real action film and she knock it out of the park cruise and blunt also have great chemistry together bill paxton and brandon gleeson give great support performance and most of the support soldier have distinct personality even with their limited screen time edge of tomorrow world building be slick and credible the cgi and the special effect be seamless and bring the great set piece and the relentless alien to life the action be really exhilarate the cool exoskeleton suit definitely help here and the script be very witty and inventive as it need to be when you re deal with time travel or time reset if you will despite its action thrill edge of tomorrow find plenty of room for character development both for cruise and blunt the script also manage to pull off some quite funny scene especially in the training segment also have to mention james herbert snappy editing because it that good the the situation could get old really fast if it wasn for the fast pace edit that concisely and freshly show the difference in each repetition cruise go through the pacing be absolutely relentless and there isn a boring moment in the film the tone of the film be pretty much perfect for summer blockbuster it not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion instead it opt for wit fun and action thrill be really grip from start to finish and have this big grin on my face when leave the theater really like the other recent blockbuster in godzilla and men day of future past but edge of tomorrow surpass them both if only every summer blockbuster be such good fun

just see just want to go ahead and say there be little spoiler in this review but if you be completely oblivious to then there no worry just catch the midnight showing of be legend and this movie be not be legend one bit think its little disrespectful for the film studio to give this movie the name be legend when it be so far from the book this movie be complete and utter remake of omega man yes there be change but it be basically the same thing this time around the creature do not speak the thing though be that when go see movie don go in with preconception of movie because when you do that you be only ruin the movie personally be shock this movie be very well make be skeptic when this movie chose will smith but he pull the part off and he do capture the character from the book thats basically where the similarity to the book end think the movie be way too short consider the budget because the movie do capture the audience but move very fast ve read people complaint about the cgi and honestly can say it do not bother me because it be no where near as bad as some say think the creature do not need to be cgi they could have use real people like the reaper in blade 2 this movie should be call the omega man because it be very much remake but this version definitely eliminate some of the big flaw in the original omega man so kudos to francis lawrence for not make piece junk and don understand why they felt to call this be legend on techinical note for warner bros guess they do not have fake dust in the budget because neville go through building which be suppose to be dormant for 3 year and there be no dust or cobweb maybe the creature dust each night and also people remember this movie may look and sound like 28 day later from the trailer but its quite different 28 day later be far superior but also very different

boe_dye sez it wasn funny it wasn not funny it wasn much of anything really certain movie you can sort of understand why they be cult classic other film such as this one seem to be funny and intelligent because someone say it be funny and intelligent and therefore must be funny and intelligent suppose you could find deep meaning in this or perhaps the meaning be right there on the surface but like many of the coen brother film that have watch either like them or don the one that like usually have strong story behind them the one that don like seem to be more of day in the life of story about people who really don seem to matter and about event that no one really care about maybe there be some type of amusement in trivial matter make bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really be but need something deep for intellectual stimulation for my comedy don need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh cynicism witty dialogue sarcasm commentary and so on not one line random event that happen out of no where with no real context and then expect to be funny which be not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn make me laugh at time very random film with very to little no substance to it few quirky one liner here and there but in all honesty be more look at the clock wait for this film to end then be look at the film wait for it to be entertain yet for some reason it have cult follow and there it be however one should keep in mind that cult generally comprise of brainwashed individual who really can think for themselves anyways and generally follow wherever they be point to like mindless sheople
well it not that good it be hard not to be bias go into this film jerry bruckheimer have be responsible for some of the bad movie in recent memory kangaroo jack pearl harbor coyote ugly go in 60 second armageddon nonetheless the prospect of pirate occupy the bigscreen for couple of hour be quite appeal there unfortunately lie one of the film weaknesses it too damn long half hour of this movie should have be leave on the cutting room floor maybe reappear for the dvd release johnny depp be brilliant as captain jack sparrow but m sure you ve already hear that in other review by now jeffery rush performance be also noteworthy however the rest of the support cast be mediocre at best depp be amaze but that in itself do not warrant throw down 9 for this movie perhaps if you stay in the theater and check another mediocre movie afterwards it would be worth it otherwise wait for the dvd at least then you have remote available
very disappointing unfortunately for everyone involve and especially the audience the creator of this reboot have no idea what the f4 stand for or what their story should be about this be rather dark without charm or humor and totally ruin one of the great villain of marvel comic sure the special effect be decent and there be potential for somewhat good film here or there but the stereotype and lack of an intriguing plot entirely ruin any chance of redeem movie experience very disappointing
silly forgettable action flick in the accountant ben affleck who be forever link with his erstwhile partner matt damon get to play both of damon most famous role he be mathematical genius an autistic savant like will hunt and weapon expert like jason bourne the movie be not as memorable as the one that feature those character however it shallow and predictable with unnecessary bookend and hard to follow plot you don need to follow the plot though the movie be well oiled machine and guess that part of the problem nothing take you by surprise nothing jolt you it a good time waster nothing more that the movie attempt to be statement on autism outside of its absurd thriller plot might be the only original stroke but then the fact that it a statement that say nothing new or interesting autistic people aren stupid just different show that it just another play in the hack director screenwriter handbook it a ploy to make you think you ve see something more important than lacklustre action movie
funny adventure in magic world movie very cute where all the thing be connect and have action comedy and diferent amazing catworld that be incredible to follow and see their weird place the protagonist have great trajectory their friend be also funny and interesting ensure happy and exciting end
plodding and predictable dog day afternoon in which michael and fredo corleone rob bank just year after the godfather part ii al pacino and john cazale be together again this time they play two bank robber sonny and sal respectively whose robbery do not go at all accord to plan with pacino in the lead role cast cazale be probably mistake for as great an actor as cazale be when you see him with pacino your mind can help but go to fredo again pacino the star while cazale play the quiet somewhat dim witted support figure it fredo all over again and think about that take you out of the experience of enjoy this movie then again there isn necessarily all that much to enjoy here the fact that cazale presence may lead you to think of the godfather movie be not dog day afternoon big problem this movie disappoints in other way ultimately despite very good performance from pacino it prove to be quite letdown so the robbery go horribly bad and sonny and sal find themselves trap in the bank surround by police hold bunch of unfortunate bank employee hostage and then nothing nothing much of consequence anyway the movie plod along incredibly slowly pace rather devoid of drama crowd show up television broadcast the unfolding event live and sonny becomes an unwitting medium star while sal whimper in the back of the bank the story doesn really move forward sonny and sal be trap and they re still trap and they re still trap and can get this two hour of my life back there a sense of inevitability to the whole thing once the situation have be establish there be very few potential outcome this be all base on true story but even if you know absolutely nothing about the real life event it not hard to guess how this be all go to turn out really the only twist in the tale come when sonny wife show up reveal the motivation for the robbery and well that quite twist so bizarre you wouldn believe it if it weren actually true if it weren true any screenwriter try to pitch it would be laugh out of the room if nothing else at least this provide for bit of story and character development after all the time spend with sonny star at the cop and the cop star at sonny and absolutely nothing actually happen aside from the introduction of the wife the movie be rather monotonous predictable crawl towards the finish line pacino be very good but he doesn have much material to work with there not much story here and what little story we have be hard to believe even if it be true the robbery fail the movie largely do too

whats all the hype ve see this movie and dont see what all of the fuss be about its not that great and dont know why people think it be struggle to stay awake and fell asleep several time try to watch this movie it tedious movie and once you finally get into the movie it end m not say it be horribly bad movie or anything just dont understand why people think it be so good
great movie ever make with the combination of the writing of the coen brother and the cinematography of roger deakins they create film as beautiful as it be funny the coen brother consistently impress me with their ability to write an interesting story with fascinate yet quirky character without resort to gratuitous sexual scene like many other writer director of rat film the coen brother manage to add the right amount of language and violence that be necessary to the story without it become the only reason for watch the big lebowski have so many clever and hilarious line that you have to watch it over and over again nothing else need to be say about it other than it be the great movie ever make
la la land be musical that dose not have good song or good story la la land be musical that do not have good song or good story the story follow woman who dream to be an actress but just can get movie role and man who want to open bar that play jazz music the story be not creative or interesting it be just so cliched the film doesn know what tone it want to go for from the advertising and the trailer you would think that this be go to be happy musical but no it a drama and not good one despite of it be drama most of the song in the movie be very happy tone and once the song be over the movie instantly go back into drama because of this the song of the movie feel out of place not to say that the song be not good they be actually very good city of star be the best song in the hole film it well write and it the only song in the hole film that fit in with the tone of the film so what about the drama if that be the main focus of the film well it not only bad but it stoop the character be always go back and forward of happy song and serious drama which just ruin the drama this film would just be alright if the end be not terrible do not make sense for the character to do what they do at the end and nothing else make sense about it that why give la la land 4 out of 10

i don get the story before begin slat and rant against the unforgiven let me make few point clear be fan of clint eastwood and have see most of his movie even like some under appreciated one like the eiger sanction do not mind lack of moral clockwork orange be one of my all time favorite do not mind cruelty be one of the few who can stand pasolini salo but don get this one simply don get it neither the first time nor the second one why do munny leave his house he leave his kid alone and betray his deceased wife why do ned logan leave his house and his wife do understand why sheriff daggett ignore the prostitute initially as munny and logan have hear about the reward he must have too so why doesn he just chase the prostitute away from the town why doesn he take their money then why do he get involve when the bounty hunter show up again don get why he risk and lose his life for couple of whore hopper my inevitable conclusion be that the story cks the character simply act irrationally sure it be beautifully shot kudos to leone acting be good so give it 5 10 but by far unforgiven do not deserve all those award they should have go to in the line of fire or perfect world probably eastwood and co be award because the committee felt guilty much good movie like dirty harry and the outlaw josey whale do not receive anything alas two wrong do not make one right
very poor if this be new animated comedy from an unknown studio it might pass as decent but it isn it be the simpson probably the best tv programme over the past 15 year so from those very high standard m afraid have to rate it as very poor just didn like this film at all as comedy it fail and surely that it what comedy film must be judge on do it make you laugh m afraid the simpson didn and therefore fail what happen to all those other character that make the simpson so good principle skinner selma and patti groundskeeper willie barney mr burn smithers where be they all m afraid this wasn very good at all and follow number of disappointing blockbuster this summer

a glorious vision of middle earth the reason why this first part of jackson lord of the ring be superior to his latter two part be because of restraint jackson be restrain from over do it with the cgi and epic battle sequence which in my opinion do not make story epic part of the reason be simply because tolkien do not have very many battle in the first part of his book which thankfully force jackson to focus on create believable world rather than believable hack slash action movie don find much entertainment in watch people mutilate each other but love it when movie engage me in world and the fellowship of the ring do just that certainly the most breathtaking scene in the movie be the moment of patient observation when the camera pan around and capture the beautiful setting of middle earth must give jackson credit he do hire some very extraordinary artist that have envision one of the grand interpretation of tolkien world there be about five particular moment that stick out in my mind and give me that tingle of goosebump down my spine when saw them for the first time the first be the introduction to hobbiton after the somewhat awkward prologue be begin to have my doubt to whether the movie would live up to the book but the movie surprise me hobbiton be perfect the house have flower patch and old fence the road look worn and make through decade of travel and the old mill spin with the laziness of quiet town every color be vibrant and every moment look as through it be take out of picture book although still don agree with the particular look of the hobbit believe everything else in hobbiton be worthy of tolkien word the second moment come after frodo awaken in rivendell and the third during the exploration of the hall of moria in both moment the camera pan away from the character and outward into static shot of their surroundings the moment make us feel like we re turn our head and gaze at the world around us just as the character do the golden waterfall of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark hall of the dwarfish mine but each be inspire in their own way and add to feel of be engage in living world my other favorite moment come during the exploration of lothlorien and the passage down the anduin and while win go into detail about the scene since they really should be experience without any prior expectation they be monument in imaginative cinema the fellowship of the ring be one of those rare movie that always wish could reexperience for the first time unfortunately jackson turn away from explore middle earth in his next two movie and instead turn to fight and warfare he seem to take lot of pride in the love story and battle sequence he create in the two tower and the return of the king but it be be in his first movie when he really get it right in the fellowship of the ring it okay if the character be uninteresting and have silly dialogue middle earth be the star and the character be the one see it for the first time
mix of green mile and shawshank redemption but in very bax way if you have any info about 80s in turkey and you be very lazy screenwriter this be the result do not watch the original korean movie but this movie be cheap rip off of green mile and the shawshank redemption movie have very dangerous message about turkish arm force and antimilitarism you don have to watch this movie

brainless but solid action movie without constant cgi explosion overload overshadow his sense for classic action bay actually manage to do something solid though the thin plot be full of improbability and morally more then questionable the dialog corny at best with the bay esqe line of humor merely randomly distribute throughout the movie disregard script and situation and though the fact that bay doesn manage to make you shed single tear for any of these people one be still constantly on the edge of his seat while the kind of entertain connery cage duo might get you trough the rest enjoy with popcorn
happy movie the only movie watch more than 10 time this fun fill movie which have the right humor at right time and will definitely tickle your funny bone many guy can replace themselves with our protagonist in one if not more situation we may find many character in the movie familiar with one we come across in our day to day life in short movie do not have any superficial stuff it bind its audience well till the end everyone act superbly and background eel music be very rightly adjust to the mood of the movie all in all very very good movie with good message s line from yes man the world a playground you know that when you be kid but somewhere along the way everyone forget it
very good until the dumbed down end so first off for all those suppose horror movie book zombie or vampire fan this be not knock off of 28 day later it base off be legend fantastic book by richard matheson write in 1954 very long time before 28 day later and in case you don know it very clearly inspired night of the living dead which have influence most zombie movie since but anyway this movie be very good at first it have fantastic open set the tone amazingly well and the effect of nyc that everyone be rave about be in fact worth the praise the use of sound or lack of it create such great effect and it even add some subtle nuance from the book that wouldn expect the movie to have such as imply that the vampire be smart and in my opinion though it could just be the fact read the book it seem as if it be imply that they be in fact form the society they do in the book or at least some organization though it never follow through with it the cgi while not convince be do at such appropriate time that the way the scene be do make up for it however the only complaint really have to make be the pathetic excuse of an end for those who have read the book they know why it be call be legend the movie try to follow through with that only they change it to some pathetic excuse of an end rather then give it the intelligence of the book they end it with some dumbed down end for the mass and no one who see it could be satisfy by such cheesy pathetic attempt at something deep my advice for people who see it watch until the girl show up then read the last few chapter of the book you ll be much the good for it
a hauntingly flaw unconventional masterpiece day after see it be still haunt by no country for old men there be just something so effectual and uncompromising about it that mere word will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display at its most simplistic the film be game of cat and mouse the mouse here be llewelyn moss josh brolin hunter who stumble upon two million in cash after drug deal go wrong and take it think nothing of it he try to cover his track but end up let the group look for the money figure out his identity the cat be anton chigurh javier bardem hit man hire to find moss and the money but chigurh be unconventional at best he also happen to be border on mentally insane and another man law man this time sheriff bell tommy lee jones be on the trail of both men as they criss cross around texas right up until its dénouement the film be simply brilliant taut and thrill it blow right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease even during moment of slow down the film stay right on track and never feel like it have run its course it engage even when it appear that nothing be happen the coen brother truly craft what appear at first glance to be masterpiece even if it be their first real shot at something that be not indelibly and inarguably their own even without read cormac mccarthy novel know that the coens have do it justice even with their bitterly twist and dark sense of humour scatter throughout the film but all of that come to standstill as the film conclude the last twenty or so minute feel like hour as the film wrap itself up and it almost feel like these scene belong to another movie entirely one that border on be pretentious and monotonous realize now that mccarthy novel probably end the same way but it do not help provide closure to the fact that the movie be so break neck pace right up until this happen its brilliance be shatter by what look to be series of tattered event throw together to provide closure for all of the character alive or dead and for its audience it speak volume to the film title but it just do not feel satisfy compare to the rest of what we saw even with its enigmatic device at play still can not come to term with how the film close it do haunt and in way it may prove to be significantly strong end as time roll on but as it stand now it just feel weak what be also bit of surprise and only seem to appear as the film conclude be the music it be not so obvious at first but the majority of the film be audibly show with just the sound the character make and no background music to speak of this element be brilliantly use as it help intensify every situation and make the film downright terrify in some case it just help truly make the film come together and only help establish the quick pace even more so it be definitely surprise and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even strong the lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film despite the film take place mainly in deserted area or the desert itself the camera manage to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting be convey the isolation and the terror almost become character themselves through these visuals and be sure to be recognize as the award season roll in the film acting be also very well do brolin anchor the film and even when it be just the audience react to his attempt at save his life he manage to deliver the best performance of his career he breathe life into moss and truly brings sense of pathos to the character we feel for him and his greedy mistake and as he develop into man unwilling to go down without fight he only manage to up the ante for himself countlessly jones as the law man stick on the fringe of every event also do very well for himself most of his work be simply deliver dialogue but it be deliver in such fashionable sense that you feel like he be speak to the big picture of thing and not just himself would have like bit more development in his character but what little there be help his performance greatly support turn from woody harrelson and kelly macdonald be also do well but be overshadow by the main cast by both brolin and jones and even more of an overcast be bardem as the ruthless chigurh he absolutely nail this character down to his very bone if anyone be merely toy with the idea of see the film it should be specifically for bardem his performance be calculate and plague with petrify silence when he choose to talk his word sound like they be be give by the essence of evil this be man with plan but it be one that only belong to him his enigmatic presence be develop throughout the film and never once do it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace come from watch him on screen be jolt to the heart and will go down as one of the best performance of the decade his terrible hair only help to make his character that more scary and formidable no country for old men be one of the best picture of the year even if it be flaw its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunt
jake s blink in prisoner be only rival by the weaslely grin in nightcrawler this movie be both fun and terrify jake gyllenhaal performance as lou bloom will certainly frighten you he be brilliant when pair with the amazing monologue style rant write for him lou bloom be drive man reminiscent of sociopath who find he have talent as nightcrawling in that he take video of true crime as they be happen to be broadcast on the news his motivation and seem lack of empathy allow him to break through and take the controversial image and sell them with strong aptitude for negotiation as character he grow more and more motivated and seem to learn his business in such way to bring him amazing success but to the determinant perhaps of his assistant and the victim of these crime the writer director of this movie make his directorial debut certainly understand fear and comedy the simple scene be make into laugh by the angle and cut it funny and enjoyable but still terrify enough to feel like real horror thriller
incredible mediocrity be miss something here when this movie come out last year everyone go on about it like it cure cancer well just saw it on dvd what be remotely new about this movie nothing it nice visually but so what think it be go to be bite snide and outrageous parody instead we get the same old family dynamic and bore be yourself speech few minor joke about expand waistline do not carry movie and frankly too much action leave me numb and animated action even more so the whole idea of the stay at home not to mention incredibly nag mother be bit tired and think the black character be really insulting be it necessary for him to be jive talk stereotype this movie be for people who actually think find nemo be good too
uncontained drivel incontinence valueless tale without any meaningful allegory or metaphor leaf you aghast that this be ever bear into the world let alone accept nearly three hour of absolute nonsense and nonsensical gibberish be leave wondering who be actually suffer from dementia the director the writer the cast or all three

ahh jennifer garner you deserve good than this though daredevil wouldn be consider one of the best comic film it do however run circle around this terrible spin off star jennifer garner as elektra bring back from the dead to become one of the deadly assassins the world as ever know in daredevil elektra be the daughter of nickolas natchios lover of matt murdock be round showed emotion and have believable storyline throughout in the sequel elektra her character be reduce to nothing more than an assassin give no reference to her past she be cold distant detach from the world say cryptic dialogue that make no sense and have sudden change of heart when she see her new target be father and daughter instead of kill them she protect them from the mythical hand group wait to take the daughter and turn her to their evil way jennifer garner truly deserve much more than she get in this terrible film the screenplay be terrible to say the least with dialogue that be either choppy or stereotypical the support character be more annoying than helpful in this flick especially the daughter abbey who unfortunately really can not act or play convince 13 year old girl who be give special ability her scene with garner always seem forced unnatural and fake the action scene be surprisingly dull give that this be fearsome warrior elektra but since the audience do not really care for the villain in the picture the scene turn out to be cartoony and uninteresting plot point throughout come off as hokey to the point of be laughable the viewer start to wonder why be they send ninjas instead of commando with assault rifle elektra be one of the bad comic book movie to come out which be disappoint since the character of elektra really be interesting and would have make well film if put into the hand of director more open tot he fact that elektra be real person who deal with real situation not superhero who be involve with all this supernatural mumbo jumbo magic too bad it would have be interest to see this turn into trilogy not recommend
a few word didn like the movie one of the most overrated movie ve ever see although we must pay tribute to marketer and all those who make so much hype around la la land you may love the picture in several case you re 14 o or so for you the form be more important than the content you re fool who dream objectively film have both positive and negative side that why my rating be 5 10 not 1 10 but unfortunately many viewer and even critic be guide by emotion rather than common sence while rating la la land
cronenberg faithful to his theme extend it to prophecy this be very profound and insightful film it focus on dialogue more than action not lot of thing happen it be demand for the audience yes but every line of dialogue suggest every line hold mean cosmopolis be like an essay about our time and the time to come what be derivative in our system and how the human mind and the human condition be dangerously shift this be pure cronenberg very mental talk about the society through the portrayal of individual psychology this be for me the most accurate yet quite pessimistic depiction ve see of what the society of money and information mean for human being and it dig quite far thus can become hard to understand our relationship to time have change you focus on minute and second it use to be manageable but now it go out of control chaotic profusion of information self contradiction be an enigma for ourselves blurry perception blurry identity and do we even have one we as spectator can feel on the edge as ambivalent as eric packer both reflective and impulsive anyway think the viewer will throw his own inner theme in the profusion of concept that rise from the film cronenberg be still the master of suggestion window big open for interpretation maybe it win touch those who feel they perfectly fit in their time facebook user people talk about money people care for what they ve be tell to care maybe you have to feel bit out of phase out of place at least sometimes to get engage in the film it be brilliant in connect the concept together in some momentum there be terrific cinematography by cronenberg on depth of field and what happen inside outside the limo eric packer inner sanctum very great acting by pattinson sarah gadon paul giamatti and kevin durand

three hour film about walk ok so forget all the hype and think about it for second 3 hour in which nothing much happen except bit of walk and then bit of fight do not good film make there may be those who be fan of the book and don doubt that to them this be great film but to anyone else who have never venture into the world of tolkien then it be huge let down there seem to be too much reliance on knowledge from the book as none of the character seem to have any back story and we haven get clue to why they be prepared to take on the quest the action scene be few and far between and when they do come they seem bit lacklustre the acting be nothing special and there be some scene the council meeting where the effect people must have take the day off which leave the walking there a lot of it in fact they re some of the best bit as new zealand look very nice however that all that get do and after while be convince that the film be go to show and advert for millet or the ramble association at the end painfully dull though if rambling or fantasy be not your thing

a faithful adaptation which mean it miss the point watchman be one of the most important text of the 20th century as deconstruction of the concept of the superhero and sharp analysis of the paranoia of the cold war it define and diagnose the period in which it be release it also deftly demonstrate that the comic book can be serious art form zack snyder get the majority of the key moment from the comic yet miss almost all of the theme for one thing everything look too perfect too clean too render by computer dave gibbon art be deliberately grungy fit the dystopian alternate america of the narrative night owl and silk spectre come together because they re lonely old hero they re out of shape and struggle to regain both the fire to fight crime and the timing and physical move they use to know but snyder make them in shape as kicker capable of take out thug in an alleyway or murderer in prison riot the violence in the original be brutal but also frequently just suggest but snyder make sure we see people get their arm cut off or their teeth break the film be poorly cast with only jeffrey dean morgan grasp the narcissism that fuel the comedian desire to be hero and his regret over his life and jackie earl haley reach the unsettled morality of rorschach malin akerman appear to be recite her line phonetically matthew goode be non entity as ozymandias and carla gugino mug underneath some of the bad age make up in cinema history bily crudup be lose beneath mediocre cgi that make his lips look like rubber band waver near where his mouth should be that say it move pretty well and be entertain enough guess and morgan best moment capture exactly what moore be go for it worth watch but as an adaptation of comic book miniseries that be must read that not good enough

cute be pixar fan no doubt they be second to none do what they do the imagery of rataouille be simply stun the people at pixar have do it again they 39 ve surpass themselves all surface so beautifully textured add strong sense of realism to the surreal universe that 39 computer animate movie and the movement of the character be so very alive and it all look so easy but anybody with even the small interest in animation will tell you it be not br br the storyline however be imho definitely one of pixar 39 weakest it 39 not completely without merit though where most of the character leave me somewhat indifferent the food critic anton ego for instance be subject to most compelling portrayal sadly he be only minor character the big problem with the story of ratatouille be for me however not in the character but in the mere fact that didn 39 laugh now compare with early pixar movie like toy story monster inc and my all time favorite the incredibles that all have me laugh loud amp heartily from start to finish this seem to lack the trade mark pixar humor
let your imagination fly funny sci fi unusual but here it not only work but do so spectacularly whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzle you leave you want more the charasmatic michael fox play wonderful bumble high schooler search for love guitar gig and his existence which he himself threaten to erase clever and humourous reference litter this fun flick reference which be far improved upon in the sequels view of the same scene from different angle different perspective and different timeline abound fun for the entire family
a stupid mess and it didn need to be walk in think this be go to suck but be surprise that it immediately seem way well than expect the actor be all great and the character be good except the girl and can figure out what she be even do in this movie there be some actual funny dialog so now you just need to blow some stuff up and it do right no it start out entertaining and just get more and more painful as it go on until in it melt down in mentally deficient mess of convoluted sewage how freakin complicate do this story need to be the hard part be already do just pull off the mission and go home everyone happy and the awful editing and shaky camera work give me headache be think hadn see an action movie this badly shot and with story this unnecessarily complicate since smokin ace and what do you know it the same guy this movie be 10 time the movie smokin ace be but that one of the bad movie ve ever see this director really need to be stop before he become the new paul verhoeven
the most over rat movie since shakespeare in love can understand all the praise this movie have be get think it a case of jump on the bandwagon for many of the critic it seem like nobody want to say anything bad about it just because clint eastwood be the director and star where do this great relationship people talk about between the boxer and the trainer come from sure didn see it develop during the movie and what do clint eastwood do that merit nomination for best actor all he do be walk around bear his teeth and growl the only satisfy scene in the movie be when she refuse to sign the paper that would give her low life family control of her finance and tell them to get lose and then even that be negate by the end which leave her family get all her money anyway and what about the legal mess he leave behind after he kill her and disappear isn there an investigation and what happen with his gym people keep say this isn a boxing movie and they re sure right about that don think there more than ten minute of box in it there be few train sequence of more than two minute she just go from someone that doesn know how to hit speed bag to someone ready for shot at the title all we here be that it almost like someone have be help her would like to have learn something about the woman box circuit but they don tell us anything about that either what be the purpose the whole sub plot with the mentally challenged guy that keep come to the gym and get laugh at by the other boxer be it just there to provide morgan freeman with his big scene of deck the bully the critic all talk about how great hilary swank performance be but there must be dozen actress in hollywood that could have do it just as well or good also they don mention that for the last third of the movie she be flat oh her back with tube stick out of her throat needle to say will be hop that by some miracle one of the other nominated movie will take the oscar for best picture m not hold my breath though this be the same academy that pick shakespeare in love over save private ryan few year ago

highly underrated picture the chase be powerful and underrated drama it have most of the ingredient that be require for solid dramatic picture exceptional act particularly by brando careful direct well draw character and good production value the first half meander little but in the second half the tension mount and the film become constantly more and more involve and move so why do it have such low reputation maybe because of all those report production problem but who care they re certainly not evident in the film recommend for mature viewer
kind of bore saw this for free thankfully and wish it be well than it be but it really the same old stuff that movie studio seem to foist on us in the last ten year ben stiller and jennifer anniston play couple who be opposite and yet they be attract to each other yes it an age old trope and if that plot twist doesn take you by surprise and thrill you the movie win either lot of sight gag and fart joke halfway through the movie begin to realize that ben stiller really isn that funny but he try very hard and jennifer anniston really isn that pretty but her hair look great and hank azaria and phillip seymore hoffman must have get pay great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho hum movie ve come to expect more from them what be interest be that saw this after saw american splendor which be truly funny and original movie and compare the two in my head and find myself wish that the movie executive would be force to sit through those two movie back to back perhaps that would knock some sense into them and they start make good movie with unknown rather than this formulaic stuff that play best on airplane

confusing be really look forward to watch this movie since the bosnia war be such present event and still remember article and news footage form the conflict the beginning be quite promising and the plot seem quite simple and interesting even though do thousand of time before think for all war possible but after the first violent shot start to get confused and the story get quite bore with plain flash of free violence that guess be there just to shock the viewer and cover the lack of depth of this movie it be very disappointing and rather violent with no sense and mingle in maybe attempt to be original and to cover something you know nothing about it leave sense of emptiness and also exploitation of such recent war maybe keep the original language instead of forced english would have help bite but doubt that be really surprised that woman have the courage to direct this and place such display of nothing this could have be wonderful story and instead be just festival of shock image and moment that after while get tiring and predicable the end be quite surprising and there again with meaning of nothing this be probably the bad war love movie have ever see and 127 minute of life could have use to do something more interesting

enough with the sarcastic with this movie be very well write ll give it that the writer obviously spend lot of time on it it be however incredibly pretentious and completely in love with itself will bet my bank account that no high school kid in america talk the way the main character do you re constantly be bombard with sarcastic wit at first it pretty funny but this movie go completely overboard with it halfway through thought to myself hmmm gay guy must of write this only they could reference this much outside pop culture and extraneous irrelevant information and whaddaya know think in the midst of try to make so many pop culture reference he forget that he be actually task with writing structure movie because the end felt pretty rush and the conflict resolve too easily oh and have the unconventional hip parent be such an original idea and funny too the writer watch juno way too much the bottom line if you re woman age 13 55 or homosexual chance be you ll love this movie if you re couple of normal average unsuspecting guy just try to be entertain on sunday through netflix on demand you ll be severely disappointed and the only positive thing you ll take away be that you get to see emma stone in lingerie and act slutty actually this be the one redeeming quality it have for all of the guy out there definitely worth watch just for that reason just put it on mute
average at best not worthy of spot in top 250 film be special effect all that be require by movie audience be quality story unimportant be character development unimportant be spectacular imagery all it take to impress apparently so this movie bear little resemblance to the work of tolkien that read 20 year ago at age 15 and truth be tell doubt that these novel could be effectively depict on screen fellowship be too long by third long movie can handle two hour plus film consist of nothing but childish repetitive chase scene refuse to tolerate mar by brilliant director whose past work be nothing short of genius but who have obviously sell out to the almighty dollar the character barely make an impression tolkien rich character should produce more excitement than funeral dirge movie feature these character should be enthral enchant it be none of that actually fell asleep during the show an afternoon matineé do that tell you something it tell me something that fellowship of the ring be not worthy of such ridiculously high acclaim want to know how many critic be pay off don blame the actor who be all top notch blame the director the screenwriter and the unwise decision to make into movie complex novel which have zero chance of be successfully adapt without sacrifice characterization

time travel never work time travel be very difficult subject to project to the viewer the writer or author of book have to be careful because once you throw time travel in to the story you could open pandora box of problem this movie base on book do as good as it can to project this idea on to the viewer but it fail miserably the time travel in this movie be so mess up it create more question and continuity error than it can resolve think the special effect be good and think that the over all direction of the movie be good but the time travel thing didn work for me when the main plot of the movie have continuity error and this one have it be spades no longer like the movie dislike it because the illusion have be break and realize that m back in my seat watch movie want to be submerge in to juicy plot which will make me forget reality for 90 minute want to watch the character grow and learn lesson or save the day or both if you be think about write story about time travel don you ll just screw it up
collosal fail short and simple story plot be very bad make no sense stupid the character of the story be underdeveloped or development of them be non exist most of them have the same trait in common not damage by intellect overall acting be ok bit more too many thing in this show just don make sense or be contradictory and don blend in fact so many thing seem to be nonsense or just plain stupid that it make the show utterly annoy not to mention the irritating piano theme music many plot twist seem to be make in way that you would be tell make up story on the spot and some way into that story you just make some stuff up about character that would let you develop the story far for example do mention that somename be also an undercover spy and because of that somethinghappens most of the character portray as simple mind what would give them the chance to reach the position in life they be portray in the same as win lottery think watch this be actually slowly turn brain into mush the reason m not rating this 1 star be because recognize the work that be do to put this thing into production
didn expect lot get less with such well know actor and actress just didn think they could go too wrong before the end even the actor seem to have give up maybe it there be no where to go with the story line so it get too absurd or maybe they just get tired of pretend they could save the movie at all really felt like every actor in it save joel kinnaman give up halfway through still do watch until the end
what happen when you combine alien and rambo there just something about 80s action film that give me joy sure they re testosterone poison macho blast where grotesquely muscle men use big gun to shoot anything that move but they re so honest about it that it become endear they re like that one jock friend you have who you expect to be insufferable but who turn out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted dude full of good cheer case in point predator star the manly man who ever man arnold schwarzenegger who likewise turn out to be surprisingly humorous and kindhearted individual in this film he play major dutch the leader of mercenary group send into the jungle of central america the mission seem to be go well until something something start hunt him and his men something not from this earth what like in this film be how it go straight to business here the setting here the mission go there and start blast honest straightforward pure in its over the topness and when the film transition into horror film it pull off well the character of the predator be one of the icon of action horror cinema for good reason the special effect be surprisingly good for late 80s albeit not perfect by any mean and the final confrontation between dutch and the predator be one of the best action set piece of the decade and that a stiff competition still it must be say that predator be not perfect film personally its flaw don bother me at all but objectively speaking can see how its mindless violence macho culture and linear storytelling might bother some viewer but in the end dude m here for the explosion the dakka and the gore
love unhappiness and independence among the idle rich this be the type of draw room comedy that dominate the 1920 and 30 with both social relevance bit of sophisticated humor and glimpse into world that depression era audience long to at least get view of frank morgan be the wealthy patriarch of this family where his son and daughter both find love with partner morgan be suspicious of miriam hopkins be the lead lady as morgan daughter fall in love with noble mechanic charles starrett while her more irresponsible young brother henry wadsworth fall in love with the pretty chorus girl carole lombard whom morgan believe be gold digger delightfully stagy this be one of the best early sound comedy and feature some great line and terrifically sassy performance by stage legend on ina claire as an eccentric friend of the family lombard have very few scene but it very interesting to see her in several of those with fellow blonde miriam hopkins in her very first film lombard have be around for couple of year but be work her way up bit by bit this film assure her place as one of paramount bright star and she show penchant for comedy that she wouldn get to do for few more year morgan be far from the flibberty gibbit character that he would play in many of his late film and it be reminder that he have start off his act career in more serious part the last scene brings everything together all very nicely with the truth of who each of the major character be be reveal and morgan make surprising discovery as to what class really be
anti story manages to make both scarlett and scotland look ugly feat of immense proportion probably should make clear that literally know nothing about this film before saw it as be usual for me except it genre and main character haven read the book neither look be all for minimalist storytelling and get away from the tired old hollywood clichés and the all too predictable over explanatory fare these day but this film be overdo it after all it film visual medium and you know at least part of your film have to look visually not ugly someone who get that be kelly reichardt which be why her film be very superior there a story clear goal the actor be more or less likable and reichardt doesn hate her city scapes glazer take on glasgow be just plain ugly declaration of hate take look at brownian movement 2010 any chantal akerman movie or even philipp glass koyaanisqatsi 1982 to get minimalism right this be why photographer be on average good filmmaker they know how to tell story in image haven see mr glazer other film but base on this it seem he a writer who accidentally and very unfortunately stumble into film and this film take the non explain to ridiculous level couldn connect once with the main character what be the deal with the motor guy leeeeettle bit more dialog would ve be nice and helpful gather from other review that she suppose to change her way go through some realisation she supposedly grow as person it wholly unclear why that be what the extent of the change be and what that will lead to take look at the road 2009 on how to get this right same type of minimalism but as viewer you don feel lose it not just that the actor be ugly but they be all totally unlike able this film manage to make johansson who be not in the slight way fat or even obese still look that way at time she no waif sure but if we talk about it as if this film be pair of jean and she be to ask do this film make me look fat we should be honest and say yes scarlett you look fat in that film get it filmmaking isn easy to distinguish between aimless wandering and minimalist story tell between realism and just plain ugliness between nudity that natural or simply very unflattering that be hard but that why they get pay the big buck in the end glazer completely fail at tell story through imagery if you can do that you can cheat via dialog but you can shun both that just dumb but be afraid that kelly reichardt and mister glazer be perfect example of the unfairness of the world she get it right but doesn get enough praise and he get it totally wrong and get way to too much 3 di 10 the melancholic alcoholic
a great cast on so not great movie it have all the element of romantic comedy the witty line the handsome cocky lead character the girl the geeky friends however failure to launch fails to launch they try too hard at be funny for example all the animal related accident one scene about it be enough but they repeat the same kind of scene 3 time in the movie make it so predictable it bore nevertheless zoe deschanel save the day by bring in amaze original line that have you laugh in almost every scene she in her character kit be just adorable and hilarious in contrast with sarah jessica parker paula who stereotypical and clichéd all in all it fun to watch failure to launch although doubt it ever become anyone favorite

bulletin the system be rig for the rich powerful although my headline above be satirical do find this documentary to be taut and concise at only 1 hr and 16 min long and although m fairly well verse on the subject do learn quite bit from it think perhaps one of the most interesting aspect of the doc be cite the memorandum of lewis powell in the 1970 who would go on to be u supreme court justice in this memorandum which he write for the chamber of commerce basically the game plan be write for the rich and powerful individual and corporation which be still be use today some 4 decade later president ronald reagan like the powell memorandum so much he distribute it to all his administration official and apparently use it to back many of his doctrine these include slashing tax for the wealthy the infamous trickle down economic theory raise tax for the middle class and the poor but couch the term as revenue enhancement marginalize or destroy union and deregulate business as much as possible the film be quick to point out that republican administration be not alone in this wealth re distribution under president clinton the 1933 glass steagall act be abolish which have very successfully prohibit bank and saving and loan from use depositor money for risky investment now it be the wild west all over again with bank package mortgage into the infamous derivative which believe lead primarily to the economic meltdown of 2008 also clinton back and foster the nafta treaty which since its inception have cost countless american job hold worker wage stagnant and put them far into debt in all three country manipulation of the medium be another goal of the rich elite or oligarchy in 1983 there be 50 major medium company and now we be down to 6 time warner comcast cbs newscorp viacom and disney investigative reporting be become thing of the distant past and any reporter that seriously challenge those in power will most likely be fire six extremely powerful and rich family such as the koch brother joseph coors et al have form private foundation to manipulate the medium and promote their agenda we even saw this in the recent federal government shutdown and near default when certain group show they be virtually willing to do anything to de fund obamacare next on their hit list will be social security and medicare cut while major corporation shield their profit overseas and often not only do not pay their fair share of tax but receive enormous rebate from the s government could write all day on this but let say the movie offer some possible solution towards the end for citizen to fight back and try and reclaim some of the wealth that have move to the rich and widen the gap between the wealthy and the other 99 of us unfortunately personally believe it will take another crisis of some sort to get people motivate enough to demand major change in this rigged system the documentary be direct by france causey and donald goldmacher and narrate by thom hartmann

i don know just don know just get out of the theater don get me wrong be entertain throughout the duration of the film but rarely get any belly laugh out of it and just want it to be well smarter and funnier the animation and production value be awesome just see springfield and all the character on the big screen be enough to make this movie worth go to but be rather let down in term of the comedy it seem like it be dumbed down to give it more mass appeal and that disappoint also have annoy little kid sit around me and their father refuse to shut them up which somewhat ruin the experience the first 45 min be good then it dip in humor in conclusion while the south park movie take advantage of the new medium by push the envelope and produce hilarious brilliant satire the simpson movie seem to do the opposite get water down in the process
stunning movie but where be the plot let me start off by say that be big harry potter fan love all 8 hp movie and really like the 1st installment of newt adventure as well this movie just didn really do the trick for me there be absolutely nothing to complain about visually the movie be even more stunning than the first one with even more beautifully design beast and as many other people have mention as harry potter fan you just can hate this movie where fantastic beast and where to find them only contain handful amount of reference to the harry potter series the crime of grindelwald have tonne enough to hype up any harry potter fan the problem this movie have for me be its plot or rather its almost nonexisting plot this movie just seem to serve as background information or something for the upcoming movie in this series for which we ll undoubtedly have to wait another 2 year or more more of like setup for thing to come it introduce many new character and reveal certain thing about already know character but yet some of these thing just felt unnatural as if jk rowling just keep write more and more to squeeze into 1 movie this basically lead to movie where the big plot be to find credence true identity not really much of plot at all some of the reveals about character also seem bit strange but that could be just me all in all all this dialogue about character make it extra confuse to know what the movie be about in addition to it lack much of plot to begin with this movie be definitely not waste of money or anything you could just buy ticket for the stunning scene and you be satisfy it just that this movie be quite disappointment compare to many people expectation think see as it basically be just setup for the upcoming movie which lack good plot
too many plot hole to be good my vote of awful may be little exaggerated but can tell you when this film end the audience literally groan the story be about some guy who we don know happen upon drug deal that go horribly wrong then find 2 million in cash and take it this guy who we find out be call lewellen don know how to spell it sorry suddenly grow conscience and decide to help die drug dealer by bring back water almost get himself kill in the process honestly as watch do not understand why he go back it be only after we leave that my wife explain that he go to take that water to that poor drug dealer next we meet our bad guy man who have be arrest escape and can continue to kill literally dozen of people even have shoot out in hotel and main street without anyone either caring or phone the police this sort of thing must be perfectly normal in texas because at one point you have one guy fire shotgun on the street and no one could care less let alone phone the police there the sheriff who try to help the good guy but couldn really care mean wtf be he do all day apart from laze about read the paper apart from anything else he get psycho run lose and like 10 dead mexican as well as two dead police officer you think he be quite busy but he really not anyway our bad guy be hunt the thief for the money and then in step woody harrelson who you assume be go to save the day but get shot within five minute honestly even after he be shot thought he be fake it and would come back and help our hero honestly couldn believe it then they have both hero and wife murder off camera and again you honestly can not believe that it happen the bad thing of all though be the end you keep think that the bad guy will get catch but no he get away after kill like 1 million people and the film close with our sheriff who do jack anyway talk about some dream he have be literally astound by this film it start off well but just when you be wait for something to happen like showdown between psycho and thief nothing happen if you want to waste your money go watch this otherwise pick something else

excel the story of captain america from the first film brilliantly be sure to stay after the credit for nice button lead into captain america 3 the winter soldier be not just fantastic sequel to

world the narnia trilogy and the first avenger have do such great job shape captain america story that this movie could almost stand on its own there be many exciting twist and turn in this well constructed political action thriller but nothing come as more of shock than how important the story be at define the direction of the mcu what take place in the winter soldier along with an awesome

action blockbuster from cinematography to pace they do infuse their own style of comedy with fun reference and cameo other than stan lee function properly within the confines of the tone and story henry jackman captain phillips wreck it ralph men first class also compose an adrenaline pump score that set the right mood every time the big fault find in the winter soldier be that it do not address the whereabouts of other hero or where we be in term of the time line of the other movie why can captain america call on tony stark to help him out or even hawkeye who be member of h e d himself this be recur problem we have see throughout phase 2 of the mcu in iron man 3 and thor the dark world marvel studio need to acknowledge this hiccup if they want us to continue to believe all of these character live in the same universe together you can not exclude these character once you have open pandora box marvel studio have hit this one out of the ball park with yet another gripping

stun performance from jake gyllenhaal the first half of prisoner be incredibly grip and power by some stellar lead performance and magnificent cinematography gyllenhaal be comfortably the standout turn in arguably his career best performance it all too common to see these aloof sullen detective suck the life out of movie with excessive dreariness but gyllenhaal get the balance between sombre and compassionate just right sadly though the writing be bit of letdown and we be leave with numerous unanswered question and directionless subplots to be honest m still not quite sure what actually happen and how event unfold everything felt bit sloppy and incomplete not to mention the film run way too long well worth watch but messy end stop this from be genuine masterpiece
didn like it this movie have some redeeming quality but basically didn like it m not very familiar with anime so maybe that part of the problem the animation seem to be choppy unlike pixar movie where the character move in smooth manner some of the scenery be wonderful but the choppiness of the character take away from the beauty of the scenery for me also the fantasy part of the story be just plain weird for me understand the alice in wonderland reference but in that story we still have animal and people as the strange character in spirited away there be strange character that don seem to make sense for example the witch baby how do she have baby and why be he huge other part of the movie didn make sense why do the father suddenly drive his car very fast up the hill just before stop in front of the stone statue why be the fantasy world suddenly surround by water it a little too strange for me
good battle scene but plot be ridiculous and film be too long this be world war ii film about group of soldier who set out to find and send home soldier whose brother have be kill the battle scene at the beginning be very good but that the only good thing about this film the plot be ridiculous the army wouldn devote soldier to find and bring home one ordinary soldier no matter how many people in his family have be kill the film be far too long and lot of it be slow

a confusing action thriller the accountant be an action thriller direct by gavin conner and star ben affleck as the titular character with support performance by jk simmons anna kendrick jon bernthal and jeffrey tambor with cast like this be it really wrong to feel tad interested in this film the movie be about freelance accountant that just so happen to work for some of the most dangerous criminal organisation around add the fact that he be on the autism spectrum and you ve get yourself an entice character who be pretty much what the entire film be revolve around the character of christian wolff have lot go on in his life and come into movie like this you would expect to get glimpse into all of the aspect of himself unfortunately feel like that be all we get in the end just glimpse into the different side of this mathematical genius really do expect to see more than what we get understand that with character such as this it be difficult to convey his different side in depth but that knowledge doesn change the way felt during the movie another problem have be that the movie felt like it be try to be different thing at different point at one stage it more of psychological thriller study how autism have affect christian and the way he live his life at other point it an action thriller about an accountant that work for the wrong people and have training that equal the level of special force this be just how it seem to me but m just some random on the internet take my word with grain of salt on the plus side the acting be all good enough to warrant watch at the very least
good film let down by an obvious and weak end if you have see the trailer this film do what it say on the tin it be decent cop bad guy film that be little different in its storyline the film rattle along decent pace and have some good scene there be some quite good suspense and action along the way as well where the film be let down be the end be just so clear aside from tiny twist from about half way through the film and even then when it happen it quite damp squib there be also part of the story that just don stack up which be shame as it have good potential
nightmare nun the nuns dark atmosphere and eerie tone make for near perfect entry into the conjure franchise the camera work be great and with very little use of cgi it make the film feel even more dark one thing for sure the nun will give you nightmare so whatever you do don stop praying

it be not too late never have be never will be too late short warning first you may like action pack toy game inspire or superhero movie like transformer or man where the action have priority over message or there be no message at all do not be alarm if it be true there be nothing wrong with you it simply indicate most probably you will not enjoy watchman stop reading and look somewhere else otherwise please continue begin to learn english reading comic superman spiderman batman men and ff later but that be more than 40 year ago when be young therefore have never hear about watchman phenomenon until buy dvd with the theatrical version then it begin saw the complete movie several time day after day become obsess by its character and theme put away my work for few day do research on the internet find out the movie be controversial for many not for me it be true masterpiece of rare kind something much more than sum of all its ingredient all part fit together while every part make others strong the story be fascinate the character be psychologically rich complex and morally ambiguous if you look deeper you find lot of disturb and sometimes unanswered question about politics people and societies some of those question flow from the movie motto who watch president bush when he launch the iraqi war to finish the job his father do not who watch israeli cabinet when it launch the gaza offensive to improve its poll rating ahead of election who watch iranian ayatollah and their dream to create new persian empire no matter what equally intrigue be question about the human nature be dictator who sacrifice million so easily drive by their lust for power or by dream of ideal society envision for their nation do they truly believe in their utopias what be really behind brutality and trigger happiness of some of the law enforcement official do they loose control or enjoy their work too much why some people prefer death to avoid betrayal of their value be ready to do that these be some of the question ask myself but there be much more from different perspective this movie make you think hard about the world around act be from satisfactory to very good the best actor be jackie earle haley as rorschach should get oscar nomination however find jeffrey dean morgan the comedian as the most charismatic he steal every scene he be in as for the music the original motion picture score be good but it be the incidental music applaud the opening sequence the funeral and dr manhattan mar monologue be the most powerful scene in the movie and the music be responsible for such impact bob dylan be songwriting genius and the time they be changin be perfect background the sound of silence illustrates introductory funeral image in an unforgettable way as for dr manhattan mar monologue music write by philip glass be brilliant choice particularly as the laboratory where he gain his superpower be run by professor glass and then come all along the watchtower one of my all time favorite will recall the related movie scene every time hear it till die some question the 99 luftballons as the right choice but not me the decision to use it convert the accompanied scene into small jewel raise the eyebrow only once when heard hallelujah after the second watchman watch it drop down however needless to say ordered the novel immediately after my first watchman watch just complete my first reading and it be certainly not the last one have never read graphic novel before and be happy it be the first one now it be the interaction between watchman the novel and the movie which make my amazement and impression so deep and lasting watchman the novel fill some of the gap and provide more context for many scene watchmen the movie enrich the picture and text for me both be perfectly complementary it seem most of the critic side with alan moore who state watchman the novel can not be translate into movie that be the writer right but if movie critic do not judge the movie as such but how well or not well the book be adopt then he or she should take care of the book movie should be judge on their own and watchman be true masterpiece as standalone work but even if the book be take into account the adaptation be at least very good in my view the change omission and addition make sense because of the time frame and other factor zack snyder style include understand some of the fan of the book be disappoint by simplification and the end in particular let us be serious shall we watchmen story take place on an alternate earth right think of the movie and the novel as parallel world that overlap mostly and differ in some respect such world can happily coexist together as an extension of the original watchman concept if we accept imaginary world why there should be only one the movie have some tiny flaw but they disappear without trace when you look at the whole watchman the movie would not be so great without watchman the novel alan moore and dave gibbon create masterpiece in graphical form zack snyder turn it into movie masterpiece if you be still with me see watchmen the movie and you should enjoy it as do do and will it be not too late never have be never will be too late for that
overrate whew maybe if have never read the book and didn know what the tale be suppose to be about could have sit through this film more patiently but to me it seem overlong and overblown and rather far from the spirit of the original work be not slaver tolkeinist no offense mean trust me there be other thing be slaver ist of so didn need word for word transcription but be disappoint
overall worthwhile but hard not to feel disappointed the first matrix movie be one of the more ground break movie in the last decade as evidence by pretty massive influence on pop culture could immerse myself in this review of just how great think the first movie be but digress the second be receive with so much hype that it couldn possibly live up to in all fairness but think the second movie be wildly entertaining and bit like the first one in the fact that it make you think quite bit after the movie be over the first one blow your mind an over used phrase when it come to review movie but it certainly apply in this case however think the second have too much action believe keanu have close to 5 fight scene morpheus have one trinity have 2 think all this fight think cut out of the plot which be why the the matrix be cool to begin with the action be fun and out of this world at time but without good enough plot viewer can feel disconnect from the character in the action the plot of the second movie do enjoy just think more time should have go into it think there be many twist and turn and it end with decent cliffhanger my own problem be that unlike most of the critic go into the third movie with lot of expectation but know see the first matrix and the previous wachowski brother movie bound from 1996 that this trilogy be go to end bit differently than conventional sci fi film and it do but more so in way that think real fan of the matrix be still left want more or let me re phrase little more attention to detail revolution do have bright spot as much as love rock em sock em well do kung fu in any movie thankfully that part of the matrix be cut back how many time do need to see keanu just entirely beat the tar out of some random machine that never really die like the fact that jada pinkett smith be at least put to some more use although it could have be more in this last film she add spark in basically every scene she in the final neo smith fight be awesome think the rain alone create very cool atmosphere but death fight in the rain be certainly something that isn new to an audience view an action movie it still the same basic plot but think too much of the plot be revolve around the destruction of zion think the battle sequence be something around 25 minute that way too long for computer generate battle at least if your movie be barely over 2 hour for 4 hour epic like the 3rd lord of the ring for example it work because they ve take so long to develop the character that the action be more thrilling because you feel so attach the support character be barely develop that be fight in that sequence the kid have back story in the ani matrix but capt mifune or the vast array of other character that get blow to bit have no clue who they be so what do all that destruction mean to the viewer it a huge display of visual effect that in the end kind of have weaken purpose with the matrix feel more so attached to the idea present rather than specific character as much as you get ta dig mr whoa keanu and the ever present bad as himself mr fishburne great in mystic river by the way and the under rat carrie anne moss just don feel as attach to them as would to say well sam wise sean astin from lord of the ring m not try to compare m just offer an example also because it be little over 2 hour there no time to get into some of the other cool support character monica belluci have one stinking line mean she a very talented actress see the passion or foreign flick malena but hell at least give her few more to see her in that dress wow lastly the overall flow just seem like the wachowski didn know exactly how to end it not enough time be really give to any of the main or support character seem to keep harp on this but if you be go to end trilogy you don have to come to end all be all on everything but it would be nice to go into more detail than they do scene between seraph and neo in the teahouse be so light and generally cool for example but nothing like this really appear in the third like what be this underlie connection between the frenchman and seraph for example what be that about all in all the matrix be fun ride interest early philosophy the first movie unbelievable special effect all three just incredible and great kung fu but it just could have end differently with more depth so try to write this while be sick at school but as un bias as could for someone who isn a fan of the trilogy overall rating 6 5 7 0 out of 10 for the matrix revolution course if you re fan you ll probably dig this way more than that s seriously hope the wachowski don pull george lucas and plan on make bigillion more of these movie because while thoroughly enjoy the matrix trilogy m matrixed out no need for matrix reboot or regenerate or regurgitate you get the picture
sneak watch no not even in the face of armageddon never compromise rorschach while rorschach jackie earle haley proclamation may be possible to uphold as superhero the refusal to compromise on behalf of the filmmaker in the process of literary adaptation be impossible as film theorist andré bazin write faithfulness to form literary or otherwise be illusory what matter be the equivalence in meaning of the form in other word bazin be argue that each medium have its own mode of representation thus the struggle for formal fidelity be lose cause and that the main objective be that the adaptation should capture the original work essence bazin continue state all it take be for the filmmaker to have enough visual imagination to create the cinematic equivalent of the style of the original zach snyder 300 attempt to adapt alan moore and dave gibbon watchman 1986 1987 be compromise but that be the only possible way an adaptation can work as film he capture the bazinian essence of moore and gibbon work deconstruction of the superhero mythos with an aesthetic that also capture much of the style of the original graphic novel to the degree it be possible in film will die hard fan be disappoint no doubt but quite unjustly even with snyder compromise end which ultimately can be interpret as be more devastating than the climax concoct by moore and gibbon although the film lack sequence on par with the opening page of the comic twelfth volume snyder ambitious attempt be the best that could be do in feature film for those of you unfamiliar with the story watchman take place on an alternate timeline begin in late 1985 the united state win the war in vietnam richard nixon have be elect to third presidential term and the only man stand between nuclear war between the s and s r be dr manhattan billy crudup human nuclear bomb who stand on the american side as nuclear deterrent the film like the comic begin with the murder of eddie blake jeffrey dean morgan retire superhero formally know as the comedian while clue point to robbery the sociopathic rorschach believe that the death of the comedian could be the beginning of plot to eliminate former costume hero hop to foil such conspiracy rorschach warn his former partner in crime fighting manhattan and his lover the beautiful silk specter malin ackerman the batman esquire nite owl patrick wilson and the smart man in the world ozymandias matthew goode collectively dub the watchman the group initially disregard rorschach theory that be until dr manhattan be force off earth make the possibility of nuclear war near certainty this complex story as reader familiar with the book will attest be existential that the typical comic book and the film be much the same much like last summer the dark knight watchman be not concern with action scene and obligatory fight as the film antagonist note in the film climax m not comic book villain and like the film he be not treat as be the product of fantastic world far outside our own while snyder do bring an unrealistic edge to the action sequence particularly his manipulation of time via cut and slow motion these technique much like those of sam peckinpah become mean of deconstruct motion just like comic book instead watchman as both graphic novel and film favor the approach of make comic book and superhero fan think about the motif and action in what become study of ethic in this study it be only the murderous and sociopathic rorschach who be able of follow any sort of moral code even if it be demented in its adherence to reject compromise for the most part snyder direction be precise his graphical style capture gibbon graphic and layout perfect right down to the book fearful symmetry the framing and camera movement mirror those of the book treat for avid fan of the book and gibbon art moreover snyder work with the actor be quite accomplished jackie earle haley continue his streak of embody sociopath perfectly patrick wilson capture the sadness and longing for great goal in life something all retire hero must face the film be not without its flaw for the most part the film and snyder do fantastic job of draw out the background of the individual character and the past of masked hero in general very well particularly during the film open ten minute and the beautifully execute credit sequence however the one character who seem to receive the short end of the narrative stick be nite owl snyder establish his background but not to the degree that the others benefit from in addition malin ackerman performance while be far from bad seem to be the weak out of the lead however her character be the most clichéd in the book so perhaps ackerman just do not have that much to work with the most glaring flaw in the film however be in snyder choice of end credit music the film like the book end on relatively quiet scene but it be entirely displace by terrible cover of bob dylan desolation row by my chemical romance while dylan version would have be fine and in keep with the period music use listen for musak cover of everybody want to rule the world in ozymandia office throughout the rest of the film the cover be loud and obnoxious and seem like it be fit for an entirely different film than the one just watch snyder have make an adaptation that be as faithful and accessible as possible compromise that be ultimately successful snyder to borrow from bazin model not only capture the essence of moore and gibbon novel but also demonstrate visual imagination that create the impression of gibbon layout and graphical style

surprisingly conventional modern animate feature have often be mark by profound rumination of life and death 39 toy story 39 39 madagascar 39 or by hip reference to popular culture the 39 shrek 39 movie but 39 ratatouille 39 this year 39 smash hit it by contrast very conventional animation straightforward cartoon story inspire by the simple pun that give the film its name indeed it remind me in some way of 39 wallace and grommit 39 although obviously without the northern english flavour like the animation of france citroen seies include and peter 39 toole be very funny voice snooty restaurant critic but think chance be miss to make the rat as physically repulsive as most people find them in real life cuddly rat be sort of miss the point and overall found as an adult viewer the same joke stretch little thin by the end of the film film where woman shoot up her own house to kill rat as happens early in this movie be not one to encourage dark thought about the nature of life
the best film you could ask for from an team adaptation if any film demand to be grade on curve it the team simply consider the notion of make big budget summer movie from of one of the cheesy television show of cheesy tv era it a crafty plan to lower your expectation as long the movie isn two hour of punch grandmother and kick puppy you re likely to leave the theater say that be good than expect guess what it work like charm the team against all odds be one extremely entertaining film it put pedal to metal about 90 second in and never let up that also savvy because it also kind of mess that would collapse under its own weight if it slow down for more than two minute director joe carnahan smokin ace narc isn take that chance action scenes come fly at you hard and heavy from start to finish the result be mixed some sequence be choppy and confuse others thrill but like comedy that never stop pitch joke content if only half of them stick the team pitch action action action with side of action and little action to wash it down the plot follow the general concept of the tv series with few tweak very lengthy credit sequence set in mexico show us how the team of former army ranger come together leader john hannibal smith liam neeson his right hand man templeton face peck bradley cooper powerful bosco a baracus quinton rampage jackson and loony pilot james howl mad murdock sharlto copley we jump ahead several year where the team be now an army covert operation crew with dozen of successful mission under their belt but when they re set up for fall by variety of villainous force the boy have to break out of jail and fight to clear their name that pretty much all you want to know about the plot right because it get pretty confuse from there and doesn matter in the slight anyway it only there to support that right action before tell you why team be worth your hard earned cash should lay out its many fault though carnahan direct it not surprising to see director tony scott be one of the producer too many scene evince scott look the camera shove in way too tight on the actor so you can tell what the hell go on in fight scene or big gun battle the special effect be wildly uneven too especially in the climax it look like the usual hollywood problem of the cgi be just good enough to make lock in release date this time it nowhere near good enough but then the team be nitpicker dream if you really want to go there jessica biel cast seem like an inside joke we re not take this seriously and neither should you so let cast gorgeous but astonishingly wooden actor in this role maybe you re wonder whether she really that bad look at it this way this be the first major film role for rampage jackson an mma fighter he not great but he not too bad and that high praise for non actor step into the iconic role yet he a good bit more believable than biel so with those issue what make the team so entertain the rest of the cast actually if you can look past biel actually look right at her that what she there for the film be jam pack with colorful charismatic performance neeson seem bit odd at first step into george peppard shoe as hannibal be considerably taller leaner and tougher but that appropriate for the movie which be basically the tv show on lot and lot of steroid no attempt be make to explain his irish accent nor that of copley who be south african it doesn matter somehow in this film it work but the film decide early on to focus on cooper hot off his success in the hangover and it the right choice you never have guess the guy who play eighth fiddle on alias would be front and center for star making performance but it true the team show off cooper buff up physique almost to the point of absurdity he shirtless on screen more than mark wahlberg in date night but cooper charisma carry the day throughout well round support cast also deliver patrick wilson and brian bloom as potentially shady character relate to the team trouble steal every scene they re in it probably doesn hurt that bloom veteran actor mostly relegate to tv work get co write credit their wonderfully brash character bring welcome levity to the pound machine of gunfight and explosion that propel the team finally would be remiss if didn note the drinking game that by all right should be bear from this film drink whenever guy with icy blue eye be on screen you pass out halfway through the film there cooper and neeson alone plus bloom and wilson with little gerald mcraney yes major dad himself throw in for good measure if you re really into dude with bright blue eye the team be like porn if you re into nonstop action and lot of male bond the team be like porn if you re into deep fully realize female character well look elsewhere but if you have to ask me what would want big screen take on really silly tv show to be the team more than fit the bill it ridiculous sure but it also ridiculous amount of fun

pure lunacy well if you want original humor mean something different than what you normally see this be your ticket the above statement be true 30 year ago and still hold it just silly far out humor it not all winner no comedy be but there be enough of them and enough classic bizarre scene that it always hoot to re visit this film from time to time the only problem have with it be the cheap shot in give in typical 1970s fashion of anything biblical but it not that bad and most of the film be pretty innocent it pretty much one ludicrous scene after another mean where else do you see knight fight on after his leg be chop off then his arm or killer rabbit it be almost like watch marx brother film 40 year later with 70s irreverence don let the pg rating fool you this would be an easy pg 13 today with all the blood some cursing and the violence know some young kid however nice kid too who love this film as much as adult so it can be too offensive if have to describe this movie in one word it would be lunacy

ghost protocol there be moment during interstellar which may be compare to 2001 space odyssey well movie there be moment during interstellar which may be compare to prometheus also well movie there be even moment and storytelling technique within interstellar that be completely rip off from inception much well movie from christopher nolan himself that say interstellar should still be tout as the most ambitious film of the year so far and in the same breath should ultimately go down as one of director christopher nolan worst film to date this highly anticipated nolan project depict future riddle with dust storm where the world food supply be nearly deplete or at least 40 to 60 year out from be deplete but that doesn sound nearly as dire where astronaut be work as farmer and child be teach that the apollo space mission be fake during this time an underground government institution call nasa commission group of astronaut include matthew mcconaughey and anne hathaway for top secret space mission this mission will have them travel through newly discover wormhole with the promise of find another inhabitable world ok let get right to it any praise heap upon this movie will be direct at the final 90 minute of this two hour and 49 minute long film since the first 80 or so minute of interstellar while absolutely gorgeous at time to behold be drench in sequence of mcconaughey seemingly reenact moment from those pretentious lincoln car ad catch in continuous and almost finger wag diatribe about how the human race be never mean to die on earth which nearly put me to sleep in other word the first half of this be as slow and lifeless as watch dead astronaut drift through space anyway this be intersellar fatal flaw since the latter half be ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequence stun cinematography and fascinate talk point deal with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe due to some really insightful slab of dialogue from script write by nolan and his brother jonathan even the literal rocket science lingo become more and more palatable as the gravity of this plot begin to set in near the midpoint of act 2 final think the end allow me to take quick spoiler free moment to discuss this end during the final act of interstellar for most film nerd nolan story will be encroach on the hallowed ground of kubrick 2001 space odyssey some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he do in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste though this be not huge issue since don believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sale the problem be that for the million who didn see interstellar for any film school aesthetic reason nolan end will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far fetch that many may leave the theater angry that the punch line wasn worth the nearly three hour set up

dance in handcuff you have to really try hard to get me to not like movie whose main theme be dance especially learn to dance you have to really try hard to get me to not like film with patrick swayze and or jennifer grey in it like swayze in donnie darko roadhouse and ghost like grey in b day off and wind this film be not just mediocre in its dialogue production and yes it dance it be actually obnoxious the ever present glower rich jew who be the owner of the jewish summer camp for jewish family everything be askew in this film grey embarrassingly conventional garb in contrast to the people she associate with be hard to watch swayze and grey dance be stiff rehearsed and inexpressive it be as though they know the move but do not know how to express their life through the dance little smile would have help the abortion reference and inclusion in the plot do not sit well with me do not find this entertaining and when the young man say could hear her screaming in the hall press eject what find particularly appal about this abortion content be one line issue by the jewish father of the child the mother be gentile in reference to the woman he impregnate some people matter and some don i could not help but think he may have mean gentile non jew in general we see in dirty dance how the other main gentile in the movie be cast as the bad boy what dirty dance need be more dynamic character play by jennifer grey she would have certainly be capable of it if you be go to create tension 30 something lady killer with young woman then bring it to crescendo and burn down the house complete the transformation of demure baby sic to the defiant and autonomous france swayze need to have life outside of dance perhaps take on the restrictive and possibly elitist management of the resort we need to see barn burner in dirty dancing with hotter more expressive dancing and much great development of the main character identity grey character need to complete and fulfill her transformation swayze need to interact more forcefully and cleverly with his antagonist swayze original partner play by cynthia rhodes may have be much well play by fire brand demi moore his later beloved in ghost professional salsa meringue dancer may have be even well because the acting be not especially difficult moore would have rectify this role object strongly to abortion be toss into picture to liven up what be still dreary and now morose film it be cheap and it be disrespectful would have give 5 to dirty dance appreciate some of the difficulty the couple go through and because of the fairly good acting by swayze and grey but the tactless inclusion of abortion as excitement cause me to detract one star choose life stand and fight the full fledged transformation we need from dirty dance never happens and we be leave wonder who these people really be watch bootmen center stage flashdance or shall we dance instead much good movie

unoriginal prison movie there be some thing in this life we will never understand how do the universe begin what happen to our soul when we die how do movie as bland as the shawshank redemption become so overrated in the case of certain other movie can at least understand the reason why they re overrate but the shawshank redemption be so average and clichxe9 ridden the film moral be basically that hope be important and there nothing wrong with that in itself heck have no problem with simplicity the problem be when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic the movie treat its borrow plot part count of monte cristo anyone and banal theme as though they be freshly mint nugget of wisdom wouldn be complain if it didn pretend to be anything more than pleasant diversion however it be with its very last shot that the movie reveal its true condescending colour if it have end moment earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea would have have some respect for it that where the superior original story end but no the director have to spell thing out for his audience frank darabont know how to tell story he just doesn know how to tell one with any originality or depth the movie be partially redeem by three thing the majestic cinematography the powerful score and most of all morgan freeman one of the very best actor work today as for my rating yes m one of those jerk who give movie 1 just to lower it on the top 250 think it outrageous how highly it rank here even the folk who make it would think it ridiculous to consider it one of the great film ever make 1
pure beauty as person in an intellectual field state that my favourite movie be dirty dance do not come with kind look however have never be more mesmerized and take by movie before or after this one everything be perfectly place and the subtle detail entwine in the major scene be excellent will always consider the car scene after baby and johnny dance at the sheldrick to be one of the most masterful cinematic scene in film history but alas all dirty dance fan know that the only reason they watch the movie be for the last scene everything build up to it be necessary and consequently move but that scene leave me breathless and goosebumped to this day do not avoid this movie because it be seemingly superficial teenage romance it be not on the contrary it be beautiful picture about life hardship and of course love
overated remember when the hype when spr be first release gawd it so realistic it show the true face of war it like be there man also remember that these claim be make by civilian with no experience of the military or combat maybe the next time film audience want to experience the horror of war the cinema might like to stick sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers that would be realistic to this day haven hear single day survivor comment on the realism of this film yes agree that the opening 20 minute of spr be outstanding as be the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that be no different from john wayne or errol flynn star vehicle there very little depth to the story which seem at odds with the anti war visuals will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro american bias it an american film make by american with american money for primarily american public for more subjective view on the normandy landing see the long day or good still read the book but the comment on monty be uncalled for bernard law montgomery spend 4 year on the western front 1914 18 he be disgust by the slaughter he saw there and make needless casualty his main concern bet the red army wish for general like that on the eastern front oh and monty win the battle of el alamein think d just mention it so just to sum up spr have some graphic battle scene overcome flaw script it a good film but nowhere near be masterpiece maybe if it be set during the korean war and be lot more cynical it might have be true classic but as it be it a case of b movie script save by brilliant director

condense soap opera with political message most of the people can get past pretty badly write script otherwise there wouldn be so many soap opera but if you like soap opera prepare for some really stomach turn scene as someone from the netherlands beautifully put it it war porn at its high first heard of the movie from newspaper story about some serbian gangster threaten the movie director angelina jolie if she come to the premiere in belgrade say to myself oh my what treat it must be really good movie if it make them angry and oh my what terrible horrible heart break miss there be no 5 minute in the movie without major logical artistic or documentation loophole after saw this movie remember two other movie recently saw one be lara croft tomb raider laugh like crazy at how outdated it be and another one be the artist why well in this case angelina prove to be kind of like the artist yes we will continue to love her how can we not but she should remember that no matter how good political message be for movie bit of good taste be absolutely vital for good movie and well she just didn show any in this movie sorry angelina you re still no clint eastwood maybe some other day after you shoot some 20 more thousand zombie alien russian and so on could go on for page like this but in conclusion only one more vital thing for understand why my grade be so low compare to the movie budget what beautiful two main character actor angelina have and what an incredible mess how limited be the connection between them one point one extra point for just have angelina try to make point and invest such huge effort in it it really make my heart melt at least she try to make point unlike so many director recently one extra point for choose so many actor from the country in the region the story actually take place in it really admirable as well as the fact that she try to film it in serbia also like the fact that the main character actor be coincidentally or not really serbian orthodox and muslim exactly like in the movie it be almost like reconciliation message in the pr story finally really like the fact that the movie be film in the local language as well wow what beautiful beautiful gesture
just awful boring plot character with no depth and no empathy no suspense or mystery turn it off before it finish and never do that total waste of time like pacino but never saw him bad and crowe who be mediocre at his best be even bad than that
great cast interesting failure when be kid grow up in scotland there use to be really cool cult film show call moviedrome it be host by alex cox director of repo man and each week he would pick film talk about it very honestly often point out shortfall and foible of the production and then show it this be before dvd of course so it be great opportunity to see some pretty weird and wonderful film thing like river edge near dark and something with dennis hopper escort dead body across the united state on train don remember what this be call this be exactly the kind of film that would have be on moviedrome great and improbable casting crispin glover and eric robert together at last unachieved potential etc busey really impress as rick he really take his character on journey and towards the end he really start to impress think the pairing of busey with indie film legend crispin glover help busey achieve this performance whether because of the good on screen chemistry they obviously have or because glover set the bar pretty high act wise other plus point include the credible and snappy dialogue and great cameo by eric robert as jennifer tilly husband manager pimp on the downside we have pretty uninspired performance from tilly and meander plot that doesn seem to get its act together until the last 20 minute or so there also part by play by goldberg and lyon be that right the girlfriend that be so underwritten that they could almost have be leave out they do that little to forward the action the terrible split screen sequence be extremely half arsed and should have be leave on the cutting room all in all very interesting failure bbc bring back moviedrome and might even pay my license fee this year
and run ran so far awayyyyy at least that what want to do with this movie the best part of the movie be emma stone cute little quirky dance to the ran song try to get back at ryan gosling character after that it go downhill for me and it just seem like every other rom com musical ve ever see give it four star for that scene alone that scene definitely should have win an oscar
absolutely hilarious ryan gosling have me in tear at time even russell crowe have me laugh it be hilarious with good story didn really know what to expect when put this on because ve never even heard of it but m so glad find it be just solid film all round have absolutely zero complaint or anything negative to say about it

the true end deep analysis as kid be never interested in star war for one reason or another just never watch any of the movie it wasn until be 17 year old that be visit my grandparent for the day and decide to watch some cable come across star war marathon it happen to be the final battle of ep 1 where darth maul fight quigon and kenobi be literally spellbound and never once take my eye off the screen be blow away by star war so much that decide to watch the rest of the 6 movie saga in one night my life be forever change that day recently decide to have star war marathon and give up to date review of the 6 movie story han solo be be hold captive by jabba the hutt and solo friend perform complex but amaze rescue the ancient jedi master yoda die leave luke skywalker as the last jedi which be bad time since the empire have already finish construct second death star and the rebel be get ready for one final assault that will decide the future of the galaxy luke be emotionally conflict because his duty be to save the galaxy from the emperor and darth vader but he cant help but feel that he can save his father from the dark side physical and spiritual battle take place in one of the great saga ending ever conceive character luke have finally mature and have become jedi knight accept his parentage luke be determine to save his father from the dark side even at the cost of his own life despite luke be the hero of this trilogy when he confront the emperor and vader he decide not to fight them but instead redeem anakin which make luke unconventional type of hero darth vader be humanize more than ever in this film despite be the villain we see him be conflict depressed and resistant to hurt his son also we witness how he be the slave of the emperor and that anakin skywalker be still alive within him which be why luke never give up on him even to the point of sacrifice himself just so anakin could resurface fulfil the chosen one prophecy han solo have the funny line in the movie and he be show to be the spearhead of the rebel attack leia be put into uncomfortable situation in this movie which she overcome by be the determined leader of the rebellion and as she learn certain truth she remain focus on the mission at hand lando redeem himself for his betrayal by be one of the most heroic and influential rebel in the final battle darth sidious the emperor in his only appearance in the original trilogy steal the show he be truly evil incarnate and despite appear frail he prove to be the great threat he have always be as he attempt to force luke to give into his anger and the darkside so he can make both luke and vader his slave jabba the hutt be only show for little while but his ego and puppetry make him very memorable grotesque but enjoyable as the first villain in this movie yoda have small role but meaningful one as he give luke his last advice before he die despite be puppet yoda death feel so real and sad but you feel he deserve it after 1000 year of constant struggle and war action the battle seem to have be scale down in this film but there be still plenty of action adventure to go around the battle over the sarlacc pit be one of the most engrossing fight in all of science fiction the speeder chase and battle with the ewoks be very atmospheric in the forest of endor the final space battle against the second death star can seem repetitive but be show just enough to keep it fresh the final battle between vader and luke do not have the best choreography but it be full of raw emotional energy as the soul of these 2 men hang in the balance most of the special effect still hold up such as jabba puppet work the lightsaber fight and the emperor force light the special edition lot of critic and fan have issue with the special addition lucas make but because didnt grow up with the version before the added effect im less bias while the first 2 movie have cgi effect insert they weren as heavy as the one use in this movie the most egregious one would be the jabba palace song and dance number its not necessary and its too weird most other effect be too obscure that just notice them truly appreciate the addition of several planet and city we saw in the prequels be use during the celebration scene it really make the universe of star war feel big the original anakin see in this movie be play by sebastian shaw and while he still portray die anakin he be replace by hayden christiansen anakin as force ghost honestly prefer this while it doesnt make much sense in universe see hayden connects this movie with the prequels well and make the saga more satisfying for me it doesnt ruin this heartwarming scene but improve it the soundtrack also have several change the best one be luke and vaders lightsaber fight and the final celebration song make by john williams that replace the original song yub nub be far more emotionally powerful and melancholy legacy on its own this movie be not the most impactful besides the luke and vader dynamic the rest of this movie can be lackluster when it come to the battle and effect which be why this movie be intend to be watch with the previous 6 film to create unbearable amount of stake and story development after watch all 6 film from episode 1 to 6 felt have be through life alter experience the skywalker saga be one of the best cinematic experience have ever see and feel it be the reason why and so many other fan be obsess with the universe of star war even beyond the movie story lastly don not acknowledge disney trilogy in any way as sequel to this saga and personally believe their effort attempt to sabotage this monumental saga which be why there be only 6 episode in my canon this be the only end to the star war saga that recognize the prequels and the other 2 movie together successfully create profound and compel story that would dare say rival most greek tragedy will say with confidence that this saga be one of the great work of fiction ever thank you george lucas
a 70 classic in his second and last collaboration with sidney lumet al pacino give amazing performance as bank robber who don plan his assault very well actually do not want to harm anyone and reveal himself as bisexual john cazale also give very good performance in one of his last film as accomplice of al pacino character the film transmit extremely well all the anguish fear and fatigue of all the character from the main until the support especially in the part that be fun charles durning also give brilliant performance as the man who try to bring balance to keep the negotiation between the police and the robber one of the best performance of al pacino and one of the best sidney lumet film dog day afternoon be one of the best film from the 70

as hollow as it be pretentious memento be film that will never be able to understand the hype around curious but completely uninvolving piece from director often criticise for be all brain and no heart maybe the sign for that begin early than most think the whole draw of the film be its backwards move narrative which reveal the detail of the story in reverse order can only ask what happen when that isn enough take that away and this be lacklustre ramble confused film that be try to bite off more than it can chew no matter how much you try to get away from it the film be base entirely around gimmick sure it an inventive one but you take that away and you re leave with bland murder mystery that play out with equally dull individual our lead character leonard suffers from form of amnesia be he can create new memory and be try to figure out who kill his wife by use clue that he have already create this structure itself be just mess we see leonard write on polaroid and try to recall event we see scene play out then another scene happen which be connect to the beginning of what we just saw and so on m not exaggerate over two third of the film be exactly that it get tiresome about half an hour in there no suspense or mystery because we ve just see what will happen so what there to be invest in how he get there isn of any interest the film be ice cold too distant far out of reach way too impersonal there be no way the audience can get connect to anything that take place the film make no attempt to get us to sympathise with leonard bar his mental obstacle which isn enough and the rest of the character be just sleazebags or wholly unpleasant the action of the character make little sense even once you find out their true motivation teddy role be one which should have be mysterious and grip but it start off as baffling and end up make no sense whatsoever by the time the film conclude actually realise that wouldn have care at all about anything that take place in the film if it have be tell in chronological order the further it progress or be it regress the more detached and bore felt in guy pearce carrie anne moss and joe pantoliano you have some fine actor that be completely waste in part that don allow them to do anything of interest all of them be shackle to the plot and restrain as result feel for pearce the most he play character so thinly sketched and load with quirk that there virtually nothing he can do with the role it here that the entire narrative device fall down too if it be try to put us in his shoe then it fail because we feel nothing for the character beyond that leonard be simply muddled lead and not just because of amnesia he have tattoo all over his body that offer him information which he doesn remember get and yet he trust what be write completely if he have no short term memory then how can he believe any of the detail to be correct that not even nit pick that a major flaw that isn explain there be host of plot hole like that base around the entire memory loss area this be clearly nolan attempt to craft twist film that can measure up to the one make by the like of kubrick and hitchcock something deeply psychological and with noir twinge with the reverse chronology be an add bonus his first problem be that he doesn create suspense properly partly because we re already step ahead of the character partly because he give us character that we can not gain connection to then you have the write the dialogue be painfully simple at time just lack any dynamism or sharpness that could hold our attention it as if nolan think the character have to spell out what already simple plot because we re too stupid to get it have little problem with his camera work and the shooting style be vibrant but it clear that this be his debut and it one he fail to get grasp of maybe he be try to be too ambitious by go straight for such story first time round m not too sure the film end with twist that be so nonsensical on grand scale that can help but feel anger that sit through the entire thing all of that for such lousy payoff what be key to note be that there be no substance to anything it be very basic mystery wrap up in gimmick that will make people think it do something unique and propel by character that be as one note as possible it be borderline pretentious it almost like people think that because the narrative style be unique that the film must be exceptional well the main thing stopping that be that it not remotely entertaining or interesting to watch it doesn matter how clever film be if it a dull mess then it a dull mess
perfect movie classic american family film with heart hilariously clever joke adventure and superb animation
ambitious complex sci fi mystery thriller offer great world building and perfectly pace storytelling wow this be by far the big surprise for me in 2016 and apparently be somewhat late to the party as the show already begin to air in 2015 m an avid sci fi fan but hadn heard or read anything about the expanse and yet it one of the most ambitious sci fi or generally high profile concept tv show ve come across in recent year first believe little spoiler free information might be helpful prior to watch the show because the viewer be thrown right into an incredibly detailed world where much be show rather than explain which be certainly an elegant choice in term of storytelling and world building but there so much go on and every shot be pack with so much visual information that it can be little confuse during the first 2 or 3 episode so what you need to know be this couple of hundred year into the future humanity be spread out throughout the solar system and divide into 3 oppose force who be on the brink of an all out war for political power and resource mainly water which be harvest in the form of asteroid ice the 3 fraction consist of the two superpower earth govern by the n and mar the third party be the belters which be basically everyone unfortunate enough to be live on poor dwarf planet like cere or other large rock in the asteroid belt hence the name belters those belters be the future equivalent of the 3rd world population as they represent the poor exploit and underdeveloped colony in the solar system many belters feel represent by the outer planet alliance short p which be radical group demand more autonomy and fair distribution of resource for the inhabitant of the asteroid belt but be view as terrorist group by earth and mar belters be badly affect by the harsh condition in low or even zero gravity which be often refer to as low or zero as well as low oxygen level and the strict rationing of water their body develop less muscle and their bone structure have less density compare to that of human bear and raise on earth or mar the belters life expectancy be roughly half of that of human live on earth so that the backdrop to the story tell in the expanse and it all may seem little complicate at the start because the plot unfold through several separate story line the key part of the story be tell through the eye of three different protagonist high rank n official on earth name avasarala play by shohreh aghdashloo cynical belter police detective name miller thomas jane whose story start on cere and young executive officer name holden steven strait work on an ice freighter in space although those three don know it yet their story be connect and that all m gon na say about the plot because this show deserve to be watch unspoiled feature visual and narrative element that remind me of almost every sci fi film ever love alien outland serenity blade runner and many more this be an rated space opera no sci fi fan should miss and although it probably can compete with 175 million cost blockbuster like the new star trek movie in term of visual effect the expanse look fantastic give the insane amount of effect work involve it must have be very expensive affair for syfy who order the series from production company alcon television and the sean daniel company and although doubt they be able to afford the kind of budget hbo usually spend on show like game of throne or westworld in term of scope and complexity this new syfy show easily match hbo flagship it appear syfy be try to get rid of its reputation as shlock channel the storytelling be meticulous and perfectly pace the world building richly detail and always credible and the patient viewer who doesn demand everything be explain within the first episode be reward with thrill mysterious tale of adventure and discovery the cast be terrific especially thomas jane who seem to fit his character like glove and the writing manage the astound feat to elegantly lead us through very complex world and complicated story without ever feel force or weigh down by expository dialogue showrunners writer mark fergus and hawk ostby know for their oscar nominate work on the screenplay for child of men really have do fine job bring the series of novel by james a corey aka daniel abraham and ty franck to life highly recommend to every sci fi fan 9 star out of 10 favorite tv show review http www imdb com list ls075552387 favorite film http www imdb com list mkjokvqlsbs less know masterpiece http www imdb com list ls070242495 favorite low budget and movie http www imdb com list ls054808375

good yes groundbreaking not really warn spoiler 15 year ago back in the 20th century the first of so far three matrix film be release it run for roughly 2 hour and 15 minute and be direct by the wachowski brother andy and lana still larry back then the film star keanu reeve with support performance by carrie anne moss laurence fishburne and hugo weaving can not say didn enjoy this film as really like it to some extent but be not wow either maybe because science fiction be not exactly my favorite genre my big problem be possibly reeve in the lead role just fail to see him as guy who bring the necessary toughness for his character here and in any other action movie all this praise about him be the chosen one make me cringe occasionally the dialog about him be so grand be sometimes downright cheesy and same go for the explosion come with the final kiss between reef and moss character another criticism have be the oracle be wrong she be present as know it all authority and in the end her prediction be simply disregard with the explanation neo have to find his way and then he be the chosen one if he choose to be oh and the song during the closing credit do not match my taste at all what do like about the film be basically all the support player especially fishburne and moss also the helper turn villain be creepy in his big scene and weaving be revelation his antagonist really make the film and the film be at its best during the scene he be in the camera shot with weave before the subway train run over him be certainly the best shot of the movie maybe the whole trilogy his parallel on human be the real virus of the planet make you wonder too if he be maybe right other than that like the pill reference from alice in wonderland early on and the green code on black ground be certainly memorable and immediately associate with this film finally would like to say that recommend this movie especially to sci fi lover although they probably have see it already anyway it be not film really want to rewatch anytime soon but it start okay and get well during the second half don think the second and third matrix film be much bad but that be maybe because don consider the first masterpiece all three be solid the matrix win four technical academy award all four category where it be nominate it no return of the king but still an admirable achievement
what be the point love qt film but this be soo boring be wait for the movie to start after 90 minute this can have 2 star because the end scene be good that about it what be the point in this film there be hardly story line what be the point in margot robbie character the whole film be an anti climax all that need to be say if this wasn direct by qt this would no where near get the hype it have do it would be class as awful simple as that
be miss something make an imdb account just to leave this review be so excited to watch what ve hear many refer to as the great sci fi film ever make the only thing keep this from 1 10 be the visuals the atmosphere be great dystopian los angeles remind me of vivid terrify nightmare scape besides that this be one of the most flat and empty movie ve ever see the pacing be never more than crawl we be give no reason to care about the character and it have the bad quality film can have it bore me to tear statement could be make that it be not great for its entertainment value but more so for its philosophical commentary on the future of machine and ai but the film do an awful job at that as well haven the slight idea what m suppose to have take from this film if one enjoy this for the nostalgia factor go ahead but if you re new to sci fi do not watch this too long didn read great visuals dull and uninteresting script and character will bore you to tear perhaps the most overrated film in sci fi history proceed with caution
complex but slow it a movie that build toward something it well act it have great film noir quality about it but it be incredibly slow get anywhere and be be time when have to force myself to keep watch not movie to watch when you re tired or in the mood for anything even resemble action
pathetic homophobic and bore honestly this movie be one of the bad gay movie ve ever see the audience be fidget for the whole length saw few people go out in the middle of the movie and not come back personally stay the whole time and couldn believe the abyssal emptiness of it 2 main problem 1 the movie be suppose to cover 8 year from 1998 to 2006 but everyone be wear 2012 clothes and 2012 haircut not just the people on the street all the actor too and in 8 year they don change clothes or haircut or anything not even once the guy start and end with the exact same shaggy beard know they probably shoot the movie under 2 week but it would be nice if they make an effort to at least pretend they didn i not say that just to be anal about it but because it one of the main thing that kill the movie because even with the title card warn you we ve change year their whole story seem to last 1 month certainly not 8 year difficult to get emotionally involved 2 the drug didn know it be drug movie but it be it close to trainspotting than to gay romance and hat the casual way it show as if all gay men smoke crack and it be normal ve be around and ve never see anybody smoke crack ever not say it doesn exist but to play it like it a normal occurrence be just stupid then there be many other thing guy who in the closet with girlfriend and 1 month later he kiss his boyfriend in the street and of course we saw nothing that show his evolution the problem just disappear there be definite pace problem as well the first 25 minute everything be happy in wonderland and you re just shift on your seat wait for the movie to start the only saving point be that the actor play the drug addict be incredibly good look apart from that you tell me the movie be sponsor by the american family association and the frc wouldn be surprise it just play into every single negative stereotype about gay people save for the child molest guess they didn have the time
rebecca demornay like stranger really like the plot and directing and act in this movie think this be one of m de mornay great dramatic role ve see her in no corny bimbo performance here great dramatic acting combine with good soundtrack and story line it have mystery intrigue romance and spice ll even use word don usually use and say the love scene playing in the snow and flash back and forth be the best ve ever scene in movie m de mornay be underrated and all the nude scene ve see of her be classy and in good taste while it have hole character wise such as why wouldn sarah know her ex fiancée sister or his cousin already somehow it still easy enough to get catch up in the mysterious tony and his motif in pursue sarah and hey anyone who doesn melt when tony be hold the wine glass pour the wine for sarah as she enter his apartment have no romantic soul there be good combination of mystery suspense and sex recommend this movie to anyone who want thrill
go have another adventure one of the funny and most touching pixar disney movie ever it be certainly fill with unexpected surprise and moment solid story which have great atmosphere and write the character be likable you get the main character carl who be go through tough time and have good development you get rusell who be well rounded character and have his own quriks and personality and some of the side character such as dug and kevin the animation be pretty good and the voice acting be great overall an enjoyable moviememorable no rewatchable maybe

very slow and bore this could ve be nice short format movie try play it at 3x speed and you ll get the impression they forget to edit the movie
mime from hell future flavour and concentrate abound for epic movie that would appear decade or more later in various superhero franchise and still do it also rive by noirish element of some year precedent and consumes significant measure of goth punk music culture and stylisation g the sister of mercy siouxsie sue ray spec and gene love jezebel none of which would have look out of place on set show its age bit now but the theme be perpetual
beautiful and realistic don normally like musical but this film wow this film have such strong meaning and music the music be just beautiful city of star and the main theme the roll around in the scene of the planetarium or at the end just take your breath away and it hit you right in the heart in my opinion ryan gosling and emma stone have solid performance maybe emma stone with 1 over gosling but still both of them very solid and big respect for ryan upgrade his piano skill for this role both have nice and beautiful voice but again will give emma stone 1 over ryan gosling what really like be that even though the movie be sad in the end it be very realistic how lot of people separate because of their dream and it real shame but some find happiness and something well and new it be really lovely movie
nothing original be fan of good cartoon and my 7 year old son and saw this together unfortunately there nothing really original in this movie where the plot be the usual one with bad guy who want to rule the world and happy end where the frustrated and control party the mole be bring to reason without inflict too much damage it barely seem to be rid on the originality of previous movie such as the good fella be unusual guinea pig instead of the ratatouille rat and at least 2 scene resemble toy story the pig escape from their child owner and the car chase where the skate board be replace by futuristic 3 ball vehicle the only interest not new but refreshed idea be that of machine attempt to control the world but the coffee machine be really use in one scene only so ok the visual effect be sometimes impressive but technology do not do all in movie
an enjoyable cartoonish comedy the following didn make huge difference but it do raise my rating bit more than one point rent this disc from netflix be enjoy it moderately but think it have enough problem to merit low 7 or c it get to the 50 minute point and have glitch have to exchange it get the replacement few day later and felt compel to re watch the first 50 minute to get back into the groove of the film especially know that want to review it oddly for such short time span enjoy it lot more on my second view feeling that it be solid 8 where it remain for the rest of the film be we there yet be primarily aim at youth market from about 5 or 6 year old to mid teen approximately the age of the two child star of the film it cartoonish and unrealistic the humor be mostly innocent although the expect bodily function humor be present it be somewhat predictable and sentimental if those quality turn you off and you re not go to show the film to kid you should probably stay away from be we there yet happen to like lot of kid film like cartoonish the bodily function humor stuff still work for me although m middle age never get to the point where be that concerned with seeming mature and don suspect that ever will don care if film be realistic or not don mind predictability or sentimentality laugh out loud at least once every few minute and smile lot otherwise there be lot of fun scenario as this be basically what call go to hell in handbasket or just hell handbasket film see my review for the out of towner 1970 and that be one of my favorite subgenres if you have taste at all similar to mine or your kid do there a good chance this film will be enjoy the story bring together two set of character remember that set can have one or even no member in which case guess we could say that the story bring together as many set of character as we like but that too odd tangent for such short review on the one hand we have nick person ice cube player roughly mean serial dater who have no inclination towards commitment who run successful but smallish sport collectible store in oregon on the other suzanne kingston nia long divorcée who just open the party planning store across the street nick fall for her as soon as he see her but she have two kid lindsey aleisha allan and kevin philip bolden and nick hate kid at the same time lindsey and kevin hate the idea of anyone but their estranged father be with their mother and they do their best to sabotage any potential suitor the fate or at least scriptwriting convenience bring nick and suzanne together under adverse circumstance and they strike up friendship which nick hope will turn into more suzanne sense his kid aversion so she keep him at distance however suzanne get in bind when she have to travel to vancouver and no one can take care of her kid so nick be recruit to bring them to vancouver chaos or gradually go to hell in handbasket ensues although be we there yet be essentially or eventually message film director brian levant be much more concerned and rightfully so with make wildly cartoonish comedy remember that levant be the guy who bring us both flintstone movie 1994 and 2000 as well as fare like snow dog 2002 jingle all the way 1996 and the early beethoven 1992 and problem child 2 1991 like all of those film too and they re all also cartoonish to an extent part of the problem for some folk might be that here the cartoonish aspect be temper with mood almost approach realism but it would be severe mistake to expect be we there yet to be believable with respect to the real world that not the aim of the film this could easily be disney film and it have many of the fantastical or unrealistic element that you expect from that style of film making in addition to his skill with cartoonish comedy levant be fine technician there be lot of attractive cinematography in be we there yet although nothing where the style be overbear to the story all of the effect work include well execute cgi personification of nick conscience in the form of satchel paige bobble head and the fine stuntwork be seamlessly integrate into the fabric of the film levant be skilled at direct his cast who all turn in performance that be more than acceptable to me and he also do great job with block fairly complex action sequence the relatively minor score song be even well incorporate and add to the story to me be we there yet seem like case of viewer go in or not with proper expectation if you don like the approach and content that ve mention above such as cartoonishness cgi fuel talk bobble head bodily function humor and predictability for experienced cinephiles you should exercise good judgment and not bother with the film if you or your kid enjoy this style of film you ll certainly find enough here to make be we there yet worthwhile and it a great way to introduce kid to the hell handbasket genre in other word like always you should exercise good sense if you have very particular taste if you have somewhat limited set of criterion for good film make such as good film must be realistic don expect to enjoy every film
not absolutely dire but could have be so much good first of all absolutely love the cartoon it be classic and great fun for adult and kid alike unfortunately while there be some redeeming quality inspector gadget come across for me as dull uninspired and disappointing but it be not the bad movie ever do think disaster movie and home alone 4 be much bad there be some bright spot one be the special effect they be very very good and the best part of the movie it be true that the film be tad low on laugh though the part when the thumb turn itself into cigarette lighter do raise chuckle or two there be some terrific scene involve gadget robot self car chase and helicopter and joely fisher be lovely as brenda and rupert everett ever reliable make an entertaining doctor claw unfortunately that where the positive end be in complete agreement with anyone who think that it could ve be so much good matthew broderick struggle to make convincing enough title character but do think it be to do with the fact that the role of inspector gadget be badly underwritten have say that the script be very weak and lack any sense of plot and drive and the plot be rather slow moving and doesn make much sense plus the editing be rather choppy overall disappointing film that could ve be so much good have it be more faithful to the show and have more of sense of fun it could have be great film rather than mediocre one 4 10 for try bethany cox
very predictable in term of the content well the movie be total waste compare to the 1st part it seem to be force upon people to watch sequel of beautifully do movie during the 1st part don think people should make sequel with non sense content like this seem like the dragon warrior seem to make fool of himself all the time and need someone to rescue which think be so stupid many time we can laugh at the dumbness of the panda there be few moment when movie be very interesting especially the panda chase around the city otherwise it seem like those old fashioned movie where hero family be destroy by villain and hero take revenge my rating be only basic on the graphic content for the movie have try to portray thing very realistically but yes 1 very disappointing thing be the 3d effect somehow put on the glass make the brightness go down many time the clarity be miss big time
i hate this movie really it be the bad movie have ever see bad story bad casting
awesome be raise in super religious home could relate to this movie all they way to the end excellent act and just and all round awesome film best film have see this year
originally decent personally find the first matrix movie little overrate it not bad movie would just recommend other sci fi movie before this one the premise be the film strong point you be so intrigue by it that you have to see how this could possibly end it do lead to some very exciting shoot out and special effect and laurence fishbourne performance be something to be say about yet it feel very muddle at time like you get the feeling of what do just see keanu reef be actually not as bad in this movie as one might think but it passable when compare to morpheus all in all see it if you want to because other people have much good thing to say about it than do
it be ok guess not really an accurate portrayal of the housing bust the movie make it out like these few people be the only one who know there be problem brewing uh no zillion of people know as early as 2004 include me and m no einstein what set these guy apart be that they figure out good way to profit from the come collapse although it be never make exactly clear just what sort of percentage return they make the michael burry character be portray as an annoy mental case which seem wrong to me since ve see video of the guy give various speech and he never strike me as nutjob except in this movie didn care for the bimbo in the bathtub explain financial jargon to the viewer very contrive no laying of any blame on the people who buy house they couldn afford lot of those people be close to idiots than victim the victim be me bail all you dumbasses out and you good believe it ain over yet round 2 come up
disjoint and vague some really good acting by costner rip beth and rainwater scenery stun general story be engage but that where the good bit stop character introduce for whatever reason and then go before they get chance to say hello from jaime and his plastic hair to storyline that start in the middle but never get to the end do lot of head scratch try to figure out what the hell be go on lot of the story seem to be make up as they go along and then someone seem to have good idea and introduce new plot scrap the old one it vaguely start tell you the outline but never ever go into proper detail g the beck brother surely billionaire have body guard and get them to do their dirty work g the native american story seem to be token sub plot kc and his wife and jaime be about as convincing as bull use knife and fork it have the potential to be excellent but fail miserably would love to remake it and give the character much strong script
divergent series fall apart with misguided penultimate installment chance be if you ve make it to this third installment of the divergent series you re pretty allegiant to veronica roth teen dystopia book or you just like watch the sweaty shirtless back of shailene woodley and theo james either way no judgment here voluntarily watch it director robert schwentke return to the series after make insurgent which he handle with acceptable competence in allegiant he get an even less script to work with and can do much of anything to counter how far fling the story have get at this point both roth actual story and the film rework version of it with the goal of turn around these film annually the studio turn to new writer and ask them to not only adapt the series finale but split it up into two part and only write part one as far as we know this task give to adam cooper and bill collage exodus god kings the transporter refuel and noah oppenheim the maze runner and possibly another writer who didn end up get credit on the film pretty much write the film death sentence allegiant the book have its problem as roth crack open the world she intricately build in the first two book and place her character in an almost completely new world with whole new stake we follow tris woodley and four james as they break out into the fringe where they eventually discover the bureau of genetic welfare and learn of the circumstance that lead to the development of the world they be bear into during their field trip beyond the fence however war loom back in the city where evelyn naomi watt factionless be at odds with those cling to the old way of life despite couple different story line and large portion of the story that split up tris and four which no hollywood studio would allow to happen for significant length of screen time there really aren two good movie worth of material without expound significantly rather than add compel new material however the script just draw out certain inevitable twist from the book and ensure the story plot point play out in action friendly way actually almost the entire plot of the book get use except the end which be lop off to make room for rouse fourth movie that have no precedent in the novel so not only be it forced script jeff daniel be awesome when he get the dialogue but watch him in this versus an aaron sorkin project be like night and day but it deviate enough from the book to confound the only people still watch the series the book fan not wise choice insurgent nearly zap the film of any character drive element and in allegiant there almost none of them the best opportunity woodley get to act be weirdly long decontamination shower scene the script doesn entirely lose the conflict between tris and four but it short live and ineffective plot device rather than the core of the narrative the first person perspective of the novel be always go to make these film difficult to adapt it show with insurgent but the quality of the popcorn munching element drop off in allegiant in part due to fatigue and in part because the story doesn resemble its former self the story and backdrop can change if the character journey stay intact but that be already fall apart before camera roll on allegiant you ll be ready to be do with the divergent series come the end of this one and see as it the third film in book trilogy you kind of expect to be relieve of that burden but ala whatever lionsgate summit can throw together for ascendant win be worth watch save for the final moment so fan can have some closure

not perfect movie but movie with some aspect that be perfect don think this movie be perfect but in many way it come very close on the down side do think it be too long there be many scene could imagine be short by 30 or so second without lose any effectiveness and one or two scene could have do without that would have bring the running time down by about 10 minute there be few line few plot issue and few bit of act that be below stellar finally there be few technical goof in the cgi obvious green screen or poorly do physic that say the rest of the movie the other 2 1 2 hour that don contain any of the nit be pick above be masterwork for starter every moment of kong be pitch perfect the cgi be masterful and the movement be sublime kong eye express more than some of the other actor and to say again although there be other moment of below grade animation every bit that have to do with kong be absolutely believable and incredible and jackson be without doubt masterful director the score be magnificent the cinematography be beautiful the performance be all good and in sync with one another all in all fine example of the craft of movie make don give the movie perfect 10 and not even 9 would have like tight plot and little more pulse pounding for that but do give it an 8 5 and still feel that that be high praise movie absolutely worth see by practically any kind of moviegoer and an absolute must for aficionado of special effect
couldn stay awake guess just don get the facination with this movie find it to be far to long goofy and boring to stay awake actually doze off for bit after struggle to stay awake for the middle hour haven fall asleep during movie since the robin william disaster toy be tell before the movie that this be one of the great movie ever make the academy award nomination far prompt my belief that this movie would be exceptional must have be expect much more than get what expect be to be draw into this magical legendary r tolkien universe for 3 plus hour have hear of the great special effect scenery and character prepare myself to be amaze what dissapointment the character with the exception of bilbo baggins be all one dimensional and boring find myself unaffected when they be in peril since could care less if one of them be to get off by an inept ork the orks be scary look but when you consider that there be probably 300 of them and they couldn defeat the 9 in the fellowship their bark be obviously bad than their bite they be as inept as star war stormtrooper the scenery do live up to the hype but think it be pretty bad when you consider the surroundings and not the story as the high point of the movie special effect maybe m spoiled star war junkie use to the industrial light and magic standard that have be set saw nothing special in the special effect but the firework at the beginning of the movie while it may sound like hat this movie didn at all it be an entertaining film but expect much more hold this film to very high standard base on the review and feedback from my peer don know how this film crack the imdb top 10 let alone the top 250 this wasn even close to the best movie ve see this month but will end up with the dvd as my wife love the film will watch it when need help fall asleep

brutal let me get this right from the get go this movie be not 7 in the broad scheme of movie not at all it be 7 in very bizarre genre where ethic moral and poor taste be enclose within small space this movie be disgust violent somewhat graphic and hard to watch at time it also just plain doesn make any dang sense throughout much of it but do think it be fantastic watch the synopsis explain the basic of the film so win bother and waste time this be film about how whoever be at top abuse those below them and how that dynamic can shift at any time and while logic tell us we should adjust our behavior to make thing good over time we really don we just repeat the abuse and send it back down over and over never learn our lesson this be an extreme literal interpretation of our behavior as society and it be deliver with depravity blood and violence there be an overall message of hope at it core but it be literally insulate in blood and viscera mind be warp and broken people die by the score everyone be monster and yet there be message of hope at the very end this movie lay bare how ugly we really be at our core as people and society and not in subtle way it pretty brutal and often gross enjoy it don know if you will

soared high but fell hard the brief response this movie soar very high but just as everything that rise must fall so do this film story and when it fell baby it fell hard the abundantly lengthy response be legend at the end of richard matheson novel these be the word that send chill run along the back of your neck and make you break out in goosebump because these be the word of the last human be on the face of the earth remnant of much old and much more familiar age sadly these word do not have the same effect upon the film audience that it do with those who have read the book in fact those three word which simply define the movie and it rather morbid sense of humor perfectly make absolutely no sense in the film adaption or at least the only sense they make be unbelievably trite and cliché because in matheson i be legend robert neville be legend amongst the last living or otherwise inheritor of the earth vampires the entire story revolve around this fact of the earth pass from one set of hand to the next with robert be eventually one of the casualty of the age and be bless or curse with the ability to watch the transition with his own eye essentially if you do not have at least this one fact you do not have be legend which be why would have be happy if the film crew have simply change some minor fact shamelessly steal the story plot device of course under different less recognizable name essentially remake of omega man when this movie begin be extremely hopeful of course there be small change make his companion the dog fat to starvation in the novel give smith more to work with for neville characterization and to portray his slow spiral into insanity and back again with more brevity change the main character from factory worker turn scientist into soldier turn scientist be not terribly big deal either and in my opinion help to lend slightly more credibility to the fact he cure the incurable virus in three year which bring me to the virus itself which find very interesting though the vampire themselves be dreadfully do in the movie the idea behind the virus be cure for cancer be very clever though give the choice between matheson genuinely fresh and interesting vampire and the film recycle viral zombie horde would stick strictly to the literature finally the end this be be find myself the most in disagreement with because up until the film end be still hopeful yes serious change have be make but have still believe that the film link to the novel could be maintain and still produce quality film to boot unfortunately my hope be shatter will admit though they have me fool for quite some time have believe that the two sole survivor only the woman in the novel would prove to be the spy cleverly send in by the more intelligent vampire to take neville as it be in the book be surprise to find that this be not the case indeed many hint have be let that she be not entirely truthful about where she have come from and her distinct lack of knowledge with popular culture lead me to believe that the movie would try to remain as close to the book as possible while still maintain blockbuster status it be to my displeasure and shock to find that the film script completely cop out with half assed end and cliché message in which the entire focus of the movie be lose to the film try desperately to patch up the metaphorical hole it rent into the story the final spoken word in the film be what prove to me that there must have be some kind of dispute which lead to this final outcome because up until certain point believe the movie be still salvageable but be lead to believe that certain person or group get involve and turn this gripping and compel story straight out of the sky and into the ground it a pity have hop that the story would get good treatment oh well maybe they ll get it right with the next book to movie adaptation highly doubt it though
just as tv start to go downhill let me just say that be very skeptical about this show judge from the sneak peak and preview assume this be go to be just another family guy brikleberry lazily animate show with some cheap and low standard well gee wizz be very very wrong rick and morty might seem like some stupid knock off of back to the future or some money launder scheme as part of late night cable tv but its not behind all the joke each episode surprisingly have strong message and whether you can relate to it or not you win 39 really feel like the end of each episode be bummer br br the weak aspect be the animation its not pretty and seem out date despite this its hard to say that this pull the show down no not even one bit the absolutely clever writing and well design character personality be basically what this show float upon br br unlike many other cartoon that have sub plot in every episode the one in this show be actually relevant and memorable they aren 39 just there as filler and they be nearly as important as the main story in fact in most episodes its hard to tell which one be the sub plot and which one be the main plot br br what 39 try to say be that this show be near perfect what be you still do watch new simpson and family guy go watch this show if you haven 39 already its great example of how tv hasn 39 turn to total crap
believe the hype the watchman semi dynastic group of superheroes with all of the emotional psychological and even philosophical problem of the rest of earth human population have be essentially wash up in his third term as president and on the verge of wwiii with the soviet union president richard nixon have ban super heroism some turn to alcoholism the comedian roguish skulk rorschach or resignation and depression nite owl ii while others exploit and explore their ability in new way ozymandias and dr manhattan yet somebody be go out of their way to hunt them down one by one will the seemingly unbalanced rorschach succeed in reunite the watchman to prevent nuclear holocaust and to defend themselves against their unknown enemy and more importantly why be they be pick off one by one and by whom load with irony strong characterization and cleverly spun plot the watchman be very much worth see the performance be generally very good though thought that matthew goode interpretation of ozymandias be little too predictable and stereotype billy crudup and patrick wilson be stand out for me malin akerman be fine but not really challenge by her role the effect be appropriate and never over bearing and the script be much good than average well directed and edited and very well shot there be only few unnecessary scene in this lengthy film unlike many comic book or graphic novel film the pace of the watchman be far from frenetic its pace be exactly that of noir film some will figure out who be pull the string early on but will almost certainly be unable to discern why and how many more will have hard time follow the film since like many noir adventure its course be not really establish until it be too late to stop or even impede it rorschach upon whom most of the first half of the film really revolve provide the complementary angry ironic and fast talk voice over to complete the noir atmosphere surprisingly despite the nihilism which underlie so much of the noir genre and be so penetratingly palpable during the real world cold war the film end up be as much about ideological conflict duality problem of perspective and philosophy as it be about millennial adventure and if you walk away question your own concept of good and evil and the place of humanity in all thing you ve pay attention in the open and thoughtful manner the film really demand highly recommend for people with good attention span not recommend for others
don bother watch this last week because do believe lilo do have some act skill that be show in some of her early work anyway want to see if this be as bad as people say okay this be even bad than just my luck that occasionally manage to be humorous in some place this be so bad that can hardly believe anyone would finance it the plot and premise itself could have be interest if there be rational script the actor themselves perform well enough but nothing could save the movie not even the pole dance scene in the strip club in fact and can hardly believe would actually write this the pole dancing be probably the most tasteful scene in the movie yes be female and resent the way female sexuality be generally depict in film so now you know how awful the film really be be it really necessary to show decompose limb in what be suppose to be mystery watch the entire movie hoping expect it to improve as it progress well it didn i think the producer be try to show how crime victim mentally process and remembers horrific experience that no human should ever have to experience also perhaps how society perceive female sexuality do appreciate the attempt because it be so difficult to understand if you haven have that experience yourself or experience the restriction the culture still place on female sexuality the virgin whore good girl bad girl mentality sadly this film fail to do that
watchable but lack depth substance this be one of those movie that be somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but be easily forgettable and have nothing of substance to make second view possible to enjoy the plot be convolute as we don know what the main character be do or why in fact everything we know about the 4 magician be reveal in the first 10 minute of the movie and after that there be zero character development the entire movie appear to have be make solely for the sake of the end and yet it be so cliché that be actually little angry about the way they do it it unfortunate that in the filmmaker attempt to be clever they neglect the most fundamental element of storytelling plot and character like magic show without magic you may find yourself somewhat entertain but inevitably wind up disappoint in the end because they leave out the most important part of the show
great movie think this be an amazing movie it be very well put together and put out an amazing message about how medium lie to sway people idea about what go on also it show how people can come together to go against totalitarian authority and defeat them without fear this movie remind me lot of the book 1984 the movie wag the dog and the movie loose change about 9 11 it show how the chancellor try to cover up what be really happen by feed lie to the public which the publice do not buy recommend this movie to anyone look for film that make you think about our govt and if these kind of thing really happen we just don know about it great movie one of my favorite
huston and bening put the femme in fatale devilish twist modern day noir with style to spare director stephen frears handle the morbid material expertly it walk razor thin line between dark comedy and too disturb to enjoy john cusack play the con man at the film center torn between the affection of his mother and his lover anjelica huston and annette bening play the two woman tear up the screen both of them be like femmes fatale who wander out of the 1940s and end up here we can be grateful that they get lose good good movie grade a

a great worth film this film be worthy of 10 10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature mean couldn bring myself to know why this simple idea of man age backwards hadn sprout up before set all the way back at the end of the great war to new orlean meeting with hurricane katrina this movie tell the story of benjamin button baby bear an old man of eighty destine to die in the mere form of zero year old find this movie very emotional and special because there reeally nothing like it honestly think when find out the immense length of the film it be go to be bore be wrong it grip me from start to finish there be many emotional and touch scene in it include the end where it bring forth benjamin button young year as an old man nothing go wrong with the cast brad pitt play great job as reverse age man and cate go well as his childhood friend overall this movie be great and recommend it to anyone who love the genre
teen pickle nose seduce by pedophile apparently some time in the late 80 a casting call go out look for teenage girl with pickle nose and guy in his 30 who could dance fairly well and play the role of the pedophile who seduce her and as result we have this film which be one of the bad ve ever see it not just chick flick train wreck it a sick twisted testament to pedophilia and really bad act fail to see how anyone could find any aspect of this film appeal well anyone except someone with bizarre secret fetish to watch half clad pedophile rub against an under age female and if that their thing they be good serve rubbing page from teen undergarment section of the sears catalog against the cover of playgirl at least they wouldn be subject to the cheesy 80 pop music bad acting and cliché plot that and as far as know sears model don have pickle nose this be why highly suspect anyone who rave about this film and would suggest they get some counseling pedophilia isn entertainment or great film make it a mental disorder and criminal offense could go on about the other element of this movie that make me want to hurl the bad script bad directing and editing and especially the music but ll wind it up with this unless you have severe mental illness and sick fetish that enjoy see an ugly pickle nose teenager be seduce and violate by 30 year old to the bad music ever write avoid this at all cost

disappoint with king kong way too long animation and special effect be good but in some area really look fake we myself and my teenage niece be wonder how ann maintain her good look dress intact after be man handle by giant gorilla dinosaur for what seem to be life time it be exactly the same with the other character be 40 year old and haven see the original version in many year however if giant gorilla be go to be bring to ny city from far away island uncharted my recollection be that the original be probably more believable some of the acting also leave lot to be desire we all find it somewhat painful to watch as every other scene with ann basically show the same painful expression on her face some of the animated scene might be too much for little people

a slow tale understand the intent of this film and it do touch me however it be poorly edit film the introduction and several scene in it be leave too long and without reason too often you feel you be live his life at real speed and while that could be powerful and helpful at time in connect you with his life it be use too often and without reason not want to give spoiler to those who would like to see this visually impressive film warn you to look for slow pace long afternoon to see it be prepare to get only the standard challenge live your life to the full from this movie of the heart without real climax or crescendo this film make you feel every moment of its nearly 3 hour run time
the power of film demonstrate the horror of war gritty intense no hold bar war film that grab attention from the very beginning and hold it all the way through the only detriment to this film be the fact that the first half boot camp be so much more powerful than the second half vietnam the film be basically about how war suck the life out of human and turn them into kill machine the great performance in this film be of course lee ermey the savage drill instructor and vincent onofrio his slow witted whip boy the viewer alternately laugh and cringes at the relentless abuse and degradation inflict by the former on the latter and at the famous line what be your major malfunction the tension reach an almost unbearable limit and the viewer cease to move or breathe this movie like many of kubrick be too graphic for many people but highly recommend it to those who can withstand its assault on both sens and conscience
typical 80s blockbuster crap spoiler spoiler can believe so many people love this film look at the premise rambo meet alien what simple wafer thin pitch that must have be bad than that any potential for generate nail biting tension be forget as the film concentrate on an all action comic book format and dialogue it essential that everytime bad guy get kill and see it the 1980s all bad guy be commie big arnie must make wise crack like knock knock the rest of the cast aren serve any good with line which seem to be compose of either crude joke or let kick some as br
like gentle glass of wine leisurely romantic and nicely write find new life story of writer emerge from seriously bad divorce and on impulse buying house in tuscany this will hardly keep you glue to the screen if you feel your attention wander but it have some lovely one liner and may appeal to the nomadic and literary nature within you if you have one france diane lane start new life and be engagingly woo by several italian lothario it isn cheesy but it isn particularly deep either would love to retire to tuscany amidst the vineyard and olive grove firefly at night and the smell of summer between the sudden downpour just can imagine diane lane there
the story be interest the movie be bore this be an interesting story researcher file his conclusion company fire him researcher talk to reporter company go after reporter eventually story get out this be boring movie crowe file his conclusion company fire him crowe be sad sad sad crowe talk to reporter crowe be sad sad sad company go after reporter crowe be sad sad sad story get out crowe be sad sad sad know that this be suppose to be base on fact and mr wigand be alive and well nonetheless be really root for crowe to blow his brain out it would have help the movie and it would be the only thing that would get the audience cheer hopefully the real researcher jeffrey wigand have work genitalia because crowe obviously do not either get pair and talk or get pair and shut up but holy crap don sit on the screen for 2 37 and just mope around like lose little doggie unless you can enjoy al pacino act like tough man in non tough man role you win like this bloated feel bad movie it deserve to be segment on 60 minute but not movie very interesting story that be very poorly do
don waste your time lax uninteresting film of course what else can be expect from kim basinger kevin spacey fan will be disappoint there be time when didn think would even make it through it be in the minority though accord to imdb user rating give it 2 at best watch primal fear instead
good and bad but overall disappointing m go to make this quick and to the point the dialogue be very jumbled the write suck to be honest because it be so very cheesy at time natalie portman make me very uncomfortable her acting and role in this film be just awkward this entire film seem very rushed and overdone overdone in the sense that there be so many unnecessary part that do not add anything to film wachowski brother seem to be on quest to convince us of this whole idea when we be right along with them the whole time appreciate the idea think it great with the government and control but natalie portman with shave head and some of the thing she do and wear make me cringe in my seat with embarrassment at one point some people in the theatre start to laugh but do not let me discourage you think it definitely have its moment but still be left question the point of certain scene character and subplots
i don get the negative review this be right on par with marvel you need to look at this like an extended movie as the episode go on it get well and good m so impressed with the act here wyatt russell have be fantastic in his role especially in this late episode daniel bruhl also have be awesome like that we see more drama and sorrow with sam wilson and anthony mackie have do awesome at explore that sebastian stan once again show how great he be at express without word the first scene in this new episode be both heartbreaking and beautiful and too my hat to him m look forward to the rest of the season and be just confuse by the reaction on here the first episode be slow but it have pick up rather quickly and you can not compare to wandavision it a totally different type of show
completely unrealistic easy seem as though it have be write by bunch of old fart or people from small town that have very close mind outlook on the teenage year and highschool it be annoy to watch this movie as teenager and no way relate to it and it be completely misleading to adults the plot be very absurd in itself and pretty uninteresting other than few unexpected twist that be completely random and have no foreshadowing or evidence to go with them overall the writing be just poor it be funny at many part though and the character development of emma stone character be somewhat good it be not worth go see at the movie or rent but it may entertain you if you re bored prop to emma stone though for give this movie something
if only bullock would have die in space in the first 5 minute over paid list actor play themselves in ridiculous plot be the audience only hope be that they both will die quick and they can listen to the wonderful music and stare out at the stunning visuals of planet earth how do sandra bullock get this role would it be her intelligence eh or her intensity eh perhaps her dazzling skill at dramatic cinema um swallow she be plainly try to recall what she do in 1994 speed with keanu reef if only bullock would have die in space in the first 5 minute come on man
its lose its base story along the way love the original series and the 2 film that follow be also acceptable and enjoy them both but what this be isn the equaliser story or character feel they would have do well give it title of its own rather than one that have follow and fan base its not even close to what expect its by far the bad adaptation of anything have see for the last couple of year
wastage of time and money watch it yesterday ocean 8 be just wastage of time and money promotes crime and bad habit in the society movie just end abruptly without make any sense of the story
visually stunning bland story know know m such weirdo for not love this want to really do but just hat the storyline couldn empathize with either of the character and find them both to be kind of unlikable however this movie visuals and choreography be brilliant the colour and dance be so fun to watch while the music be meh not huge fan of musical everything else be really cool and well think out
worth the watch great addition to the judd apatow comedy and sentimental work happy to see pete davidson succeed in this role really happy with this movie
this movie be true masterpiece consider the getaway true masterpiece on the same level of sam peckinpah major achievement save the wild bunch of course learn from imdb comment that the final cut of the movie be make by other people mcqueen than the director moreover the plot be much unfaithful to the original novel well anyway the result be excellent doc steve mcqueen be tough laconic guy carol ali mcgraw tough laconic woman in some sense they mostly speak just for technical reason take the money bag don scratch your wound if they ve nothing to say they keep quiet they seem shy to express their reciprocal feeling even unable to say love you doc can not accept what carol have do although just to help him out of jail they both silently suffer for this with some explosion of violence by doc and ready gritty reply by carol but the audience well understand from their body language how much they love each other think that mcqueen and mcgraw make superb job in their difficult role strangely enough their performance as well as their line receive much criticism fear that people didn like their job since they be too use to the current way of act hysterical scream awfully clown like with line that be just flood of stupid pointless annoy chat not welcome legacy of the style create by tarantino oliver stone and imitator nothing could be more far away from peckinpah artistic taste the story of the movie be linear but not trivial the cinematography and montage be outstanding the pace be somewhat slow partially due to the great care pay to detail but when it the time of action nobody can compete with peckinpah grand style in every movie of his peckinpah show his genius with some astonish stark new cinematic idea in the getaway we find the paramount representation of the power of the shot gun doc shot gun bullet destroy police car devastate whole hotel demolish an elevator knock down door slaughter the thug hidden behind the recoil of the weapon lift doc shoulder who remember that this stuff nowadays almost cliche in action movie be introduce in the getaway it worth note that an early imitator of peckinpah shot gun scene be steven spielberg in sugarland express some word on the sub plot concern with the hateful rudy al lettieri and the cretinous fran sally struthers this part of the film be deliberately disagreeable up to an almost unbearable point as usual peckinpah doesn miss his chance to be hat by the feminist with his design of fran damn idiot nymphomaniac just for stupidity at the end when doc hit her punch straight on her prate whimper mouth the director nearly provoke stand ovation by the audience men and woman as well if that not cinematic genius what else be it and speak of imitator how much tarantino character owe to rudy and fran perhaps the getaway could have be even well without extraneous interference nonetheless it be fantastic film must see
a telemundo soap opera on the big screen my wife and enjoy the original overboard and watch mom on tv so we think we might enjoy the remake if you love telemundo and the soap operas they show you might like this rent the disk and glad didn waste my money watch this at the theater no way compare to the original overboard only watch this if you have nothing else to watch
one of the best movie the actor the script the scenery make it one of the best movie have ever see the best played character of the joker be amaze that how imagined him in the film he be portray as an ultra intelligent person with psychopathic brain honestly be very surprised that someone know for their niche production would play such good role as one of the most important character in the batman series unfortunately we will probably never see the joker so well again because heath ledger from unknown circumstance die this be sad news however back to the movie the main character batman play by christian bale also show the character very well therefore my rating for this movie be 10 10
funny first off emma stone be pretty delightful m not normally huge emma stone fan like her when she be good and don when she isn so great she not an actress that sell movie for me but this be definitely one of her good performance partly think this be due to just how good she be with comedy just like in la la land her humor be use to great effect to endear you to her despite the fact that in this film she be go to take pretty dark turn this be of course help by outstanding casting for her parent stanley tucci the lovely bone 2009 and patricia clarkson the green mile 1999 both of them play pretty woke parent who seem more like pal with olive than parent with heavy heaping of sarcastic wry humor suppose that my first negative with this film though the sarcastic approach to everything do wear thin after while and isn help much when everything turn out ok and we get more earnest heartfelt piece of olive and her folk there be certainly bit of that teen angsty attitude of anyone who care about thing too deeply be dumb it funny at time but as hopefully people eventually grow to understand that the world be more complicated than that so the humor and fun becomes try at certain point and yes know that part of the point of the film just don think that excuse comedy from lose its funniness another failing of the film and this be nitpick be the way that the internet and technology be portray in the movie it just so unrealistic and feel like it be write and design by middle age people who happen to see on the news that some kid be really get into that internet video thingy get that there be some lag when it come to figure out how to portray online life in the aught but this be make in 2010 not 1999 it barely any good than the portrayal of the internet in mission impossible so save the bad for last and it be probably particular to me and other christian but the way that religious people be portray in this film be simply offensive easy be basically movie about girl who be straightlaced but through well intentioned lie develop reputation for be slut this bring her popularity with guy but she lose lot of her old girl friend and become the target of clique of religious do gooders who make fun of her pray for her and basically become her most vocal hater as christian have never meet single christian who act the way these one do this be come from guy who like the movie save in that film mandy moore lead similar group of christian concerned crusader but she isn the only christian in that film there be plenty of others who aren so cruel why do this film feel the need to build straw woman out of amanda bynes hairspray 2007 who can act to save fictional soul and then take her down like the mockery of christianity that she be there be plenty of other people who don like olive apparently promiscuous activity that aren burden by be wholly unlikable in every way know there be christian out there who can be real jerk but that doesn excuse this portrayal in medium landscape that frequently use christian as their villain it would be like show muslim in this movie and have him run around yell allahu ahkbar and threaten to kill all the american at the school sure there be bad example out there but to single them out unnecessarily and constantly put real bad taste in my mouth that didn stop me from have fun with this movie though think anyone there be lot of people who would like this movie lot for its humor and heart also its pretty rare to see teen comedy that discuss sex so heavily and openly but isn so raunchy that it have to be rat it certainly still too rough for some audience but for many this movie will hit that sweet spot of be highly enjoyable and entertain without do too much to turn of weak kneed viewer
joan bennett be worth wait for beautiful lounge singer joan bennett as brenda lucky bentley marries racketeer businessman george raft as steve larwitt the two be blissfully in love but his criminal past spell r u l think prison will protect mr raft from rival gangster ms bennett help the b put him behind bar but she tearfully regret it when raft be sentence to ten year at alcatraz the frame up be engineer by raft sneaky aide lloyd nolan as slant kolma who want bennett for himself she reject mr nolan and rent the house across the bay from alcatraz to be close to raft enter walter pidgeon as tim nolan producer walter wanger do wonderful job showcasing bride bennett in this crime thriller bennett be stunningly present and act well too others in the cast be also very strong but it would have be nice to tie mr pidgeon aviation character in with raft somehow perhaps as wronged business partner or old acquaintance boozy blonde gladys george as mary lends notable support director archie mayo and photographer merritt gerstad do an excellent job the three prison meeting scene be marvelously stag with help from assistant director charles kerr and alfred hitchcock the house across the bay 3 1 40 archie mayo joan bennett george raft lloyd nolan gladys george
bizarro neo greeting again from the darkness ok the trilogy be over neither of the sequel stand up to the fascinating and ground breaking first but despite the script flaw and oft lack dialog all three stand as tremendous action special effect movie revolution try to tie up the loose end regard purpose and especially death keanu and carrie ann be off screen for way too long during the battle to save the dock hugo weave as mr smith be again both entertaining and frighten but he also be off screen for extend period jada pinkett smith look great but could have probably pull off her role in the last 2 without the hour of train she get to flaunt very little of her power up body the best movie rely on the story and character the matrix trilogy begin with an interesting story and screw it up its best character be there til the end but somehow we be leave unfulfilled the action on the other hand be probably beyond compare up to this point in cinema
do you think pest be annoy or funny falk be both here it be interest to note andrew bergman write the script for this one and the recent remake star michael douglas this be by far the good version there be several reason for that arthur hiller direction be definitely well in this one over the new version then there be the more talented cast as peter falk and alan arkin be definitely more talented than the cast in the remake it be not that douglas be not talented but that he do not fit his character as well as the original actor douglas be saddle with an inferior director in the new one too it be wonder they didn get tim burton since he be the king of bad remake but you can always get the best of the bad the main thing be that this be an original and fresh material version of this film when the remake be make it do not get fresh approach it stick with the original in do so it fell flat because imitation be not always the sincere form of flattery peter falk be most known as columbo but this be one of several comedy film he make falk do comedy well and this film be no exception his teaming with arkin here be inspired produce very good result when watch this film the recent loss of peter faulk be felt even more as he be incredible in this as the opposite of columbo just wing it without regard to detail the result be so funny
good action in begin end but crappy script best war movie of all time one of my favorite and so on please the beginning be awesome with amazing action scene but then what it the usual usa save the world with who would have guess it hero and nauseating flag waving and other clichés just can believe that this movie be consider to be the 14th best or 12th or whatever it be right now of all time what most surprising about save private ryan be that all the american who watch it could get out from the theater with their big head they can honestly say that this be how they think wwii be can they all american and not brit frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight this movie be make for an american crowd and to make money at the box office not to make believable story about day it suppose to be really emotional when an american get kill or injure but the german be shoot down indiscriminately this be sicken to me be an american life worth more than german spielberg seem to think it be
deterioration of franchise what make great horror movie the subtlety and finesse in craft tension and horror without reveal much the gradual buildup of horror through the unknown have the audience know that something be out there and not reveal it immediately the nun do the exact opposite of all of this be invite to an early premiere of the nun yesterday and although didn have high expectation be still disappoint watch all the conjuring and annabelle spin offs thanks to my wife obsession with horror flick but for the most part enjoy most off them consider the success of the first conjuring always hop that the next sequel prequel build on the strength of the first where tension and horror be build slowly and gradually culminate in tense and horrific scene and climatic finish unfortunately with each new installment find that the same narrative and scare trope be implement make the movie more predictable and mundane unfortunately the nun take this to whole new comical level how can such ip go so wrong creepy demon nun check old isolate abandon castle check pseudo religious lore to build on check romania check the producer and director have all the ingredient to create great horror flick they end up make movie more tailored to young adult teenage fan base rely on cliche story line extremely dumb protagonist and never end predictable jump scare don get me wrong like good ol jump scare when use right but this movie almost solely relies on them but the bad part of the movie and where think it get it so wrong be how it reveal everything way too much and way too early not only do you see the nun in the first 5 minute and constantly jump out every 10 minute you hear her scream attack victim etc repeatedly throughout the movie by the time the third act take place you already have see all the scare on offer and it become comical the entire theater be literally laugh throughout the final act overall it be disappointing movie there be not point in tell people not to waste their time watch it as the movie will piggy back on the success of it predecessor and make ton of money and ps what be the deal with all the demon growling and scream like hungry hyena

average should have be dark story this movie be definitely not bong best and certainly not the most entertaining the music score didn suit the movie some of the act too eccentric and doesn match the movie story instead of the over the top corporation performance it should have show more emotionless and robotic business character than over the top personality the movie should have go from light humorous to more darker tone which would have be more emotionally involve for an audience viewer good to watch once but that about it

nature the landscape be ethereal and profound with chill and many of the shot be use as screensavers the more beautiful thing be the more they be mark as object of contrast by the story the struggle between human being and nature be not only reflect in the game between the hero leo and nature but also in the collision between advanced civilization and primitive civilization which be stag in such magnificent and bleak scenery

mary max wonderfully unique and personal animation there a constant stream of animated film these day but mostly they re either glossy hollywood product pixar dreamworks or japanese anime for adult want something different we have to wait for the like of the nightmare before christmas waltz with bashir persepolis or aardman film to turn up mary max be one of these film that come as complete departure from all the others both in visual and storytelling style and stick in the mind because of it win repeat the plot here so ll just mention few pro and con the con be obvious some people will be put off by the almost constant narration which take me while to get use to the rather numerous calamity lot more than you expect if you think this be just kid film and the sadness within some of these people story it actually little surprising that the film get make without the people finance it demand script that be more tailored to appeal to wider audience what we get be something that feel whole lot more personal than the high profile animate film it feel personal and therefore real and the explanation be that it be write from life by director who have real feeling and sympathy for people who don quite fit into the world and feel alienate or be misunderstand by others mary be partly inspire by the director own childhood and there a little bit of toni collette muriel heslop throw in suspect and max be also base on real person he be pen friend with but so far have never meet in person the way the film handle his asperger syndrome just feels different to how you normally see such an issue handle on screen there a constant stream of humour ironic black childish and really enjoy the small perfect touch on grow up in an australian suburb in the 70 and 80 and the depiction of grey new york as it appear to the easily frighten max the animation be constantly joy to watch and highly recommend see it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciate in all it hand make glory

utterly annoy beautifully edit film and direct the main character be the most annoying imbecile narcissist disturb useless and just plain dumb one ever see on screen the masterful directing and editing and great styling and styling be not enough to keep anyone interested if it wasn enough there be few useless politically correct subplots attach with cello tape just because as in everything hbo lately nothing wrong with convey the right message but when it pretentious and out of context be just annoy anyway if you like the idea to watch the most annoying character ever do dumb thing around the globe always always drink vodka or anything alcoholic in every damn scene then this show be for you
top 250 criminally over rat lotr suffers from technically proficient but creatively challenge story tell team the meandering plot the stilted dialog the lack of pacing and the amateurish tone all lead me to believe that peter jackson should stick to horror film where his ability be far more suited to that genre expectation look forward to the day when wide eye tech lover awaken from their cgi induce hypnosis long enough to pay attention to the plot and the technical merit of well told story perhaps then talented cast and film crew win have to be waste on project with only studio marketing team and profit driven consumer tie ins to recommend it
over rat first saw this film when be 15 think it be brilliant really original and generally great however now 3 year later realise it be nothing more than pretentious piece of garbage br br sure it look good but when you really get down to it it 39 not do anything it doesn 39 have any real substance it 39 not comment on anything it 39 just totally throwaway product tarantino be talk loudly and say nothing and that narrative structure it look and feels original but independent and foreign movie have be do it good for year and year br br truly trashy piece of postmodernism at it 39 bad

a total mess you know when you re casually walk down the street and some lunatic drive past you at an obscene amount of mile an hour you think that driver be moron right well scott waugh need for speed be movie full of moron these people just have total disregard for road safety and it immensely irritate even if you can see past this fact regrettably there remain lot to be desire in this somewhat underwhelming thriller break bad aaron paul take on the lead role of tobey marshall talented racer in his spare time who run car repair shop however when he be challenge to race from an old foe dino dominic cooper close friend of tobey be kill during the contest follow collision with dino car tobey be frame for manslaughter however and spend some time in confinement upon his release he set off on revenge mission and though break his patrol he embark on cross country trip alongside julia imogen poots to take part in prestigious contest and seek vengeance against dino in the only way he know how street race naturally comparison to the fast furious franchise be inevitable and when do so let just say this doesn come out on top need for speed struggle from not truly know what film it want to be it a more sincere seemingly poignant piece of cinema yet it not nearly profound nor earnest enough to take seriously on the other hand it not ridiculous or illusory enough to be consider good fun either which be where fast furious come up trump the latter have tank and aeroplane and all sort of absurd farcical addition that make for an entertaining cinematic experience this fall carelessly between and though this may sound like an peculiar thing to say but in order to be good film need for speed almost need to be bad meanwhile the car chase themselves be mightily impressive making for some gripping sequence with really well choreographed stunt implement the film do feel humanised somewhat too and in part it slightly more intimate than other film of this ilk much of that can be accredit to paul who as expect be the best thing about this picture he bring fragility to the lead and although he a real cool race car dude there an everyday quality about his demeanour that work well he do seem to be do an irritate impersonation of deep voiced batman though talk of which michael keaton also have completely superfluous support role he like narrator or sort and an immensely unsubtle one at that effectively tell the audience what we re suppose to be think and feel naturally sensationalising it all for cinematic effect conversely poots do little to offend though her casting be somewhat unusual and follow on that awkward moment if she not careful she go to fall into the stereotype of just become generic vacuous british love interest in hollywood movie and she good than that need for speed be incredibly conventional and prosaic with so little innovation in this title as film we ve see countless time before the formulaic over dramatise score epitomise this notion as clichéd song play out exactly when you expect them to manipulate the audience and remind us what emotion we re suppose to be feel at that very moment the film also struggle to reflect real life in any way shape or form of course this be just cinema and not to be take at face value but when film be attempt to imbue human compassion and to trigger an emotional response from the viewer it have to be judge accordingly
awesome film shame about the trailer room base on the book by emma donoghue start on young jack 39 5th birthday he get birthday cake from his mother but no candle visit from his father and gift albeit belatedly this would all be perfectly normal except that all of this take place within 39 room 39 confine space with only single skylight for daylight and no mean of escape for the mother joy be abduct as teen and lock away for sex in the style of the dreadful real life example such as that perpetrate by josef fritzl in austria jack be the presumably unintended result boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single side wall and with the staunchly held view that the thing he see on flicker tv screen be in 39 tv land 39 and unreal will jack and joy survive and ever see freedom again br br and that 39 where 39 ll leave this synopsis since if you 39 ve be lucky enough to avoid the trailer there be tense cat and mouse story to unfurl here br br this be an absorb although slow move film that build to some truly nail biting moment the screenwriter also donoghue and director irishman lenny quot frank quot abrahamson be to be commend in keep the story and drama really well ground and un saccharined old nick sean bridgers the 39 evil kidnapper 39 be not paint as some predictable monster he be even portray to be kind and caring at some warped level and there be no gratuitous sex we be in effect seven year into the story and the abnormal be now completely normalised br br the film be tell primarily from the viewpoint of jack jacob tremblay but we also get under the skin of joy brie larson and her emotion in try to mentally deal with her ordeal look at picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comment that quot nothing happen to them they just get on with their life quot br br the acting be superb make the mistake of vote for john boyega for the bafta rise star award before see this film you can cast your vote here http www bafta org film award ee rise star award in 2016 not that boyega isn 39 great but brie larson really really delivers here she obviously win 39 give hoot if she win the best actress oscar and for me for this award she shin out in what would perhaps see as one of this year 39 weaker oscar category jacob tremblay be also exceptional as jack and it would be nice rather than try to compare young performance with adult one as per anna paquin if there be special award category for actor and actress under 10 if there be then tremblay would storm it you seriously forget that this be child act part he be totally connect to the role and these two core performance lock in your belief in the story br br support the cast be the ever reliable william macy as joy 39 mentally tortured father joan allen pamela landy from the quot bourne quot film as her equally distraught mother and sean bridgers as the kidnapper br br at 2 hour long some of the scene in the middle of the film make my attention waver little but my main criticism be in the trailer and marketing of the film if ever there be need for true 39 teaser trailer 39 this be it never know who be responsible for put trailer together whether the director have the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bod in the distribution company but whoever it be they should be take out and 39 give good talk to 39 for this travesty it 39 like put all of the twist in film like quot the cry game quot quot the sixth sense quot and quot go girl quot in their respective trailer 39 ve go so far as to create my own one mann 39 movie cut of the trailer just for you good people which have include with my bob the movie man com version of this review br br leisurely nuanced and effect drama this be not for fan of quot die hard quot or quot fast and furious quot fan but for everyone else this should be must see br br please visit bob the movie man com for the graphical version of this review thanks

bearable kung fu panda 3 meet the minimum requirement in what fan of the first two film would expect joke about weight po still struggle with handle kung fu even though he become the dragon warrior at the end of the first film and question of how to determine what true family be sadly the film itself lazily meet these expectation without provide much else for its fan base we start with an uninteresting villain play by k simmons he be an associate of master oogway and that be how he be know this joke get really old really fast within the film itself he manage to escape the spirit realm this universe equivalent of the afterlife and be determine to take over the spirit of kung fu master because well who care the film simply establish he be bad guy who want revenge and to have control over the real world you know your typical one dimensional child movie villain po father play by bryan cranston find him at the start of the film which be really convenient because panda be suppose to know about something call chi which be what the villain be after panda be know to heal oogway with this power in the past and it be of course the only way to stop simmons character this subplot eventually clear up what we do not know about the panda in this universe and of course the film go to great length to make comedy out of how lazy panda turn out to be the joke use in this film be just rehash joke from the first two film not provide great comedy as its predecessor since it prove to be unoriginal kung fu panda 3 be still enjoyable but its strength lie on the theme of questionable identity pose by the two compete father of the film mr ping and li this be only touch on few time throughout the film but when it be touch on it bring up interesting question about whether po would need nature or nurture that be do he need his biological father or the one who raise him these moment be the only one of great intrigue within the film there be also return to cop out fight technique from the first film that make the conflict of the story less difficult for po to get through while the film have the same spirit of its predecessor kung fu panda 3 be not very fun film but it be not terrible
just because you can doesn mean you should yikes before anyone try to discredit me by say just don get the point of the production you should know that have the official broadway record the be release haven ever be to live show but ve see the spectacular show on video time and time and time again m aware that it something to behold an event devoid of any particularly define plot or purpose that the charm of the performance after all right well yeah but that doesn translate to film group of human being in cheap costume with low grade cgi prance about without purpose on movie theatre screen doesn work it not performance of the broadway show it a feature film and in that venue it fail miserably the talent that be employ for this production aren showcasing their strong effort the main name taylor swift be literally put in to sell ticket to the movie her character ultimately do nothing for the film really don care that there a new song or that there a big budget put into this movie all the money in the world can take concept that work good in one medium and make it into good film this performance belong on the stage and on cd as film it bland and it leave nothing but horribly vile taste in my mouth this movie be real hairball no question about it want to chase these cat away with spray bottle hope never have to endure this torturous mess again

so much potential but it sadly squander warn spoiler you ll find lot of scathing review of the last airbender around here d like to give it fair level head review and point out its positive though will address its fatal flaw this could have be well movie the trailer and commercial be actually rather promise but in try to cover an entire season of popular cartoon show it end up be rush and disjoint director night shyamalan write script that play like ambitious fan fiction that cherry pick some of the season most popular important moment from the season while throw out pace and character development have hop that what happen to peter jackson would happen to shyamalan and that make something completely different from his previous work would be just the thing he need but forget that jackson put lot of work and effort into his pre lord of the ring movie while shyamalan be the lazy director ever he even admit it in interview and that he be humbler more grounded director it isn entirely shyamalan fault at the last minute paramount studio decide to convert the movie to 3d which end up do more harm than whatever good it could have do and have several scene cut that might have help flesh out the story and add character development ll now get to the good part it look really good with setting and costume that often recall its source material and really nice cinematography there jam newton howard sweep stir music score like the bending effect they re no perfect but don always want my sfx to be like in lord of the ring the matrix or heaven help us avatar because sometimes that too much to ask like the action scene like the imperfect but earnest performance by noah ringer and nicola peltz as hero aang and katara dev patel anti hero zuko later in the movie though his early scene leave something to be desire and shaun toub give the movie best performance as uncle iroh capture the spirit of his character perfectly but the rest of the cast be unintentionally hilarious as they give bad performance like poorly do high school production of shaekespeare in particular jackson rathbone be as stiff and dull as he be in the twilight movie they may as well call his character jasper cliff curtis be just silly as fire lord ozai both in appearance and performance and aasif mandvi give strange performance as commander zhao though the fact that the character be rewrite from be ruthless fierce and intimidate to be gloat weak underhanded goon doesn help the situation be even bad thanks to the hollow exaggerate dialogue the actor be force to say that even hurt the good performances the film be also rush sense of pace with event happen so quickly we don get chance to catch our breath and exposition repeatedly and over dramatically tell to us to help us keep up when character have to talk about plot point every ten minute or so that a clear sign you have script that too busy and to top it all off the movie be poorly edit go from place to place in its scene so fast and sudden some viewer might get headache paramount be hop to make the last airbender into trilogy with each entry base on season storyline from the cartoon the end certainly hint at thing to come but the negative reaction and possible box office failure may stop that if there be sequel they good get another director and if they don they really need to get different writer because the first entry have lot of potential but it be hopelessly mire by uneven act awful dialogue terrible sense of pacing and crappy editing that may kill the trilogy before it can really start
dangerous simplicity enjoy this the first time saw it but then again be only an easily impressionable 14 year old craving for new emotion recently more than 10 year later revisit it and barely manage to finish it bluntly it as plain and trite as it get in fact believe frank deliberately want it that way so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goer in general have no problem with simple feel good movie that do not take itself too seriously and be not look to change its audience in profound way however this do and it seem it be succeed unfortunately we have story about hope and its redemptive quality portray by an innocent man that be send to prison tim character it tell through the eye of his close prison friend morgan character the narrative framing and flow be rigid there be no rhythm no ebb and flow no metaphor no irony just constant relentless narration extreme simplicity it strip to the point that you can only remember the generic message dangerous stuff some people carry it around and apply it diligently the others only observe the snowball effect hope there be more intelligent endeavor out there hope everyone see them and appreciate them hope 1 5 skip this if you be over 15 there be no art here almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling 2
sadly it be waste of resource the director may be think that an eye for an eye be the only solution to all problem or may be life be not profound to have it more deep understanding any how in the end result be shallow production that can not go beyond cliché give two star only for the beauty of cinematography for get really good picture so well do to creative director and art director but if you consider the waste of resource it be even lot for this film be very sorry for all the time and the money spend to this film during production surely it could be use for much good purpose
disappointingly derivative d miss this first time around and keep meaning to see it through after the first twenty minute roller coaster and despite the poor special effect still have hope the rest of the film felt like remake of all those 60s 70s 80s find something war movie like the dirty dozen d write about all the homage sniper shot etc all of which be visually and dialoguely underwhelming know spielberg can be sentimental but phew it be veritable lasagne of cheap emotion and love john williams but the pull tear jerker string and last post bugle all the time love tom hank but struggle to find him believable lot of the time band of brother be light year well but that suffer from patchy act sorry think it be dreadful
definitely classic this one hour feature just have to be see director sogo ishii film the famous german band einstürzende neubauten in deserted factory loft the perfect industrial set for their music it all look very rough as you would expect it from one of japan most influential filmmaker his influence on shinya tsukamoto can not be ignore this film be rarely to be see if you get the possibility to watch it do not hesitate the image and the experimental sound build up perfect connection which you do not get that often in concert documentary
keep the book finish read the book this week and so decide to watch the movie the difference between them be huge unfortunately the movie isn that good for lot of reason what make jane austen pride prejudice an amazing book isn the love story between lizzy and darcy but how she be able to concoct full circle story full of subplots with so few in her hand even be write in the 19th century the book be some kind write to be adapt somehow the chapter be divide like scene those who be familiar to her book be well know that the lack of place and their description be for the fact that she be single home writer woman and never person who travel lot or be interested or able to know different place which also give reader creative freedom to build in their mind their own place and location jane primer interest always be how people be able to relate to each other within their society and their different social class in era full of manner and custom she be gift social observer know perfectly how to outline and describe people personality into her character give to the reader the possibility to always differ character by their way and the most important thing their dialog by the way she structure them she couldn be able to describe perfectly place but she could describe perfectly and paint with word character and its personality as the title say all the gear of entire book resolve under both word and jane play with them all the time make them part of every single character sometimes be merit or sometimes be flaw the movie not only cut lot of what be in the book but also misinterprets important meaning and character also it lack of the subtlety the irony and the sarcasm that be some of the most important characteristic of her style even the movie use most of the original dialog the actor seem to don know whom they be exactly play because they never give the impact or the subtle characteristic that jane describes mr bennet in the book be describe as man intensively sarcastic dry by year of marriage that slowly replace the love by day by day consideration and convenience respecting and be comprehensible to everyone but never be tender figure completely the opposite of what donald sutherland portray in the movie and his remain american accent the same can be say about some other character keira knightley in my point of view wasn the best choice and her 2006 academy award nomination be doubt in my head but prefer keep to myself my opinion about her as know that there be lot of people that intensively defend her performance mr darcy be serious man tire of the hypocrite society that surround him and the usual formality for be public figure he almost sociopath because he love the one he like and live with but he despite the one he never meet he a man of few word but he not impolite he subtle he clever and great observer and matthew macfadyen may have strong figure and presence but his performance be cold and empty and not just contain and oppress as mr darcy really be mr collins as jane austen describe have force and inconvenient formality use difficult vocabulary when speak to impress and seem noble but he be not insecure and freak as the film show most of the cast fade credit go for those one who know what they be do like brenda blethyn as mrs bennet and judi dench as lady catherine so analyze the movie as whole think that joe wright could indeed have take more advantage of the social criticism jane austen so implicit describes also the relationship of people around their pride and prejudice the subtlety and the sarcasm of the dialog and the constant british formality
three character in an inferno of dysfunction perhaps an essay on how we be now use technology the video camera for example to interact with our fellow human or maybe an essay on the attraction of pornography alienation loss of humanity the film do not address any subject specifically or take point of view it present three character in search of context father son wan na be porno actress the father continue to sink low while the porno actress start cement connection with the frustrated young man director moodyson stag the action in hand hold style and give everything pornographic intensity sometimes the style obscure the message but the end result be still an experience worth attend there be some eroticism on display and we get close ups of sex change operation character vomit into another mouth and little sex mixed with gluttony the overall impact be chaos and color three character exist in their own inferno of dysfunction the film rawness remind me of khan tusion rough sex 2 and some of the german sperrgebiet video it not about redemption and it possess no answer but it depict reality we fear and know be out there sanna brading as te be highly watchable and sexy under the circumstance bjorn almroth be very believable as disaffected youth eric and thorsten flinck be atrociously authentic as miscreant dad rickard not recommend for everybody
this be what it look like when filmmaker take risk deadpool be triumph of artistic vision over studio interference little credit should be give to 20th century fox as they have zero faith in the success of deadpool movie to put thing into perspective ryan reynolds fight for this film back in 2004 when blade trinity be release reynolds and co go to shoot test footage that be then leak online by reynolds because fox have no intention to release it to the public finally after year and year of beg to the studio and the overwhelming positive response of the test footage from the public fox didn even tell reynolds and co that the film be greenlit they have to find out online like the rest of us plebeian if that sound bad fox even cut their budget by 7 million at the last minute which cause the writer to scratch some action sequence that m sure would ve be great to see deadpool now have the big open weekend in the month of february surpass fifty shade of grey the big opening weekend for 20th century fox surpass all the men film and the big opening weekend for an rat film ever surpass the matrix reload with all that be say deadpool be hilariously entertaining film that work mainly because of reynolds himself his comedic skill pay off gloriously as the titular character who give so many quip in one instance that some joke will be miss of course credit should be give to the writer too aka the real hero here and it impressive that this be tim miller directorial debut the action sequence and pace be so good that you think this come from veteran director from the ingenious open credit to the subversive end deadpool constantly upend clichés and trope you re use to see in superhero flick in the past few year what great here be the filmmaker have something weird and perverse and just go with it joke about pedophilia pegging and sex run rampant but it never really dark despite the mature subject matter on top of that it also very refresh to see pansexual superhero in such big studio film it unheard of these day fox and other studio learn from this success it not the fact that hard rat film can do well it that deadpool also happen to be very good most likely because you fox actually give the filmmaker the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they want
chill this be one of the best movie have see all year and one of the top horror story ever tell it creepy simplistic and eerie be impress by the enchant simplicity of the plot the lack of need for hollywood special effect and the haunting atmosphere that loom over everything from begin to end the first half or even three quarter seem to move along bit slowly but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where be bite my nail in anticipation of the inevitable nicole kidman character grace be tear between empathy and disgust for her at time but she definitely succeed at captivate me with their life and story predictable in part but it still leave you guess this be quality ghost story with an old fashioned ambiance downright spooky be in awe of the end fairly intelligent premise it the kind of movie that let you escape reality for while by entertain you but at the same time return you to the real world with your spine tingle wonder if there isn some possibility of truth chilling
the eye candy make the film worthy of watch 1939 be in all probability the very best year of any year in the last 100 year of film release so to be fair fast and furious have huge hill to climb to receive any recognition when it be originally release in such stellar year of film making and film release have say that there be somewhat similar lovable on screen chemistry between actor franchot tone and ann sothern as there be between the great katharine hepburn and cary grant it be relatively fast pace fast talk ozzie and harriet style film with actor franchot tone get himself into some deep doo doo with his wife ann sothern by finance beauty contest under the guise of take much need summer break vacation during heat wave the story get bit tire around the half way mark with the husband and wife banter but then the eye candy of the bathing beauty provide deserved distraction not only for financier husband joel sloane but for us the audience it a cute film that be happy to watch the mid range rating of 5 out of 10 imdb rating be because it be nothing special either

pretentious director who can edit their film to reasonable length due to narcissism drive me crazy any movie such as this one that have painfully slow move scene need to be edit and shorten other than that the period detail be exquisite fine costume and cinematography the acting be fine good score as well the story be fair at best it be not very involve due the bizarre storyline as with so many of coppola film there be flash of brilliance accompany by too much pretension perhaps if he would get off his pedestal and actually watch one of his film
a nation that do not deserve to be recognize by the us this movie have me go the title be perhaps the great idea that hear think it be an independent movie about zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and group of lone survivor band together and plan to take out the zombie dead wrong it about psycho cop with weakness for kill his female arrest get what come to him when pack of zombie woman rise from their graf in order to get proper revenge as you can see there be nothing about the nation nor county involve where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster cause our nation first off the zombie woman look like victoria secret model with dark eyeliner and pale face what be zombie but mindless debatable intelligent cannibalistic kill machine that eat as result of their primitive most basic need these zombie woman walk like streetwalker and runway model they talk as if they be in poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombie sure the eating and killing be there but where be the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement although it be very interesting concept and perhaps great satire on the zombie genre it make fun of that genre and ask the question why can zombie be beautiful vixen kill machine would say that this movie would be consider really bad indie movie that be produce and make by garage junky would not recommend this movie to anybody that love zombie genre too much it an insult and as for scary not even
its rating get some other movie lose their meaning you know that imdb top 250 be always discuss the overrated movie the underrated movie the movie which should be in the list the movie which should not be in the list etc believe that movie like memento cause problem the rating of some other movie lose their meaning they cause some other movie lose their worth memento have one of the most smart brilliant and complicate script of all time and also the story editing of the film be the same it must be very hard to make as know the story begin from the end and retrogresses in term of direction it be well but no more than that so good movie good crime thriller the tone of the movie be independentish don say this in good way or in bad way but it just look me interest even if could not understand it exactly there be also twist at the end recently saw the machinist which can call christian bale memento it be pretty good movie but there be plot hole but there be not in memento so appreciate the effort but it be neither one of my favorite movie nor great movie if its rating have be 7 7 or let say 8 0 it would have be welcome probably it be because the script be brilliant agree but as movie generally 8 6 be extremely over

how do you review cultural icon this film as well as new hope have put me in very very strange predicament how exactly do one evaluate film in which one know the entire plot priori to no fault of the film as well as film with astound visuals at the time but very poorly age visuals and shot selection today such be my problem with star war as franchise so consider the circumstance let me shortly say the following star war be an excellent intellectual property base on an excessively cheesy movie franchise feel similarly to the star war franchise as do the marvel cinematic universe they be set of fun and entertain family movie that can make your imagination go absolutely wild know m not alone in pretend that be jedi or superhero when be young what the franchise be not be any sort of art film or strong statement about anything it be pure fun but perhaps well leave in nostalgia than film to come back to as the weight of the visual technology fade it be hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack be enough to carry it conclusion wonderful ip and universe very cheesy film
the great long train chase the general be set during the civil war and feature buster keaton as confederate chain engineer chasing after union soldier that steal his train keaton handle the lead role well and the support cast be also solid the film have impressive cinematography and score that be good at first but become repetitive the enlistment scene near the beginning be amuse as be the under the table scene and the point be group of union soldier desperately try to fix part in the train track near the end the film battle scene be well shot and amusing and the end of the film be well do where this film languish be in the overly long stretch of scene on the train which while well shot become repetitive didn find lot of humor in the train scene which make the train scene seem mostly like precursor to modern action film rather than comedy since lot of the film be consume by the repetitive train chase be leave disappointed
not as good as people say it may be reasonable courtroom drama but the so called shock end be easy to spot several mile off have see the usual suspect which be far good film which use similar idea primal fear be quite slow and tedious rent if you re fan of richard gere or john grisham
remember when chest buster be scary this stink it really do and this come from man who own and love many cheese fill z movie although would in no way say that avp alien v predator 2004 be good movie have tiny soft spot and find it watchable at least this hack job make that film seem like the pinnacle of creature feature nirvana predator ship encounter problem on board by way of newly bear predator alien hybrid it crash land on earth america and thus requiem be bear as face hugger go crazy alien run amok predator fight back and the cast of genre stereotype kill or be kill the end all the maker have do here apart from attempt to kill off the franchise it seem be splice together various staple from the other film in the series be it the setting or confrontation they have just up the blood quota the film have no substance what so ever character so dense and unlikeable you root for the monster by way of have no choice dumb teen in angst rambo mom ex convict try to do good you name it and chance be you have see it in other rubbish murder death kill movie there be gore galore which m sure will appease the easily pleased and in one particularly monstrous scene involve pregnant woman sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come monday morning but you honestly would be good off watch some cheap no budget slasher film from the 70s because unlike the money back hack director here they have an excuse back then drek 1 10
i do not get it absolutely unwatchable try it twice figure one attempt wasn sufficient be not offend by vulgar language but when it be such major portion of the dialogue it have well be with good reason and to great effect neither be the case here these character be the type of people that normal people with life pass by numerous time day without take any notice there be reason for that folk like that be uninspiring dull and generally useless to the world they inhabit center movie script on them be go to make you dolt or genius depend how sycophantic your fan base be it seem too many people check their good judgment at the door not only give this movie free pas but pump up the vote to the extent that this turd rate in the top 250 whoa geez again say absolutely unwatchable
this movie be great but need to be watch more that once spoiler love this movie and tend to disagree with most people who describe charlie as crazy think he be actually brilliant everything he say in this movie turn out to be true he be constantly tell miranda thing and say if you don believe me look it up charlie be genius but most people don believe him so they label him as crazy think the stuff he do in the movie prove his brilliance miranda be constantly skeptical about what her dad be say then in the end he say something and then if you don believe me look it up but she say she doesn need to because she realize he not crazy after all think this movie be also say something about people who live by the beat of different drummer like charlie they live their life differently then most people you don necessarily have to work 9 5 job to work he say he isn look for the treasure for the money and she say something like you would if you have to work and his reply be that it depend on what you consider work there be lot of subtle thing in this movie that you don get unless you watch it and listen intently you probably have to watch it more than once there be part near the end when charlie say something about the passageway be suppose to be 40 bar 120ft down if there be passageway it must lead to someplace where he be probably head when he dive in the second time
simpson movie bad simpson ever be one of the many fan who have see every simpson episodes with the exception of few new one and believe the old episodes up until 2002 be significantly good than the new one rumour of simpson movie have be around since the mid 90s and ever since then could not wait to see it now that have see it regret do so believe the movie be disgrace and should have never be make instead of be create with the production value of the classic what be deliver be lengthen stupefied version of new episode the movie contain none of the classic approach to comedy such as when homer be send under water to find the lock ness monster and turn out to be play an arcade game episode monty can buy me love or when homer tackle mr bont please research mr bont before you post you re foreseeable predictable ignoramus remark result in his death episode you only move twice both of these episode contain random comedy scene that be within the flow and storyline of the episode it be almost like there be nothing random actually go on the movie use an approach to random comedy that be more reminiscent of bad rip off of family guy there be some reference to past episode and couple of classic simpson comedy scene but nowhere near enough to redeem the rather lacking story line m still unsure if like the animation use e the shadow and close to 3d shade for these reason have rat the simpson movie low and don ever want to see it again
no summary necessary what be strike about this film be how it have affect its intended audience it isn intend to be for general consumption and hat the gore but love that it be hard for me to figure out the best indication of how successful the script writer be be that the comment from the people he be attempt to entertain show such knowledge of film create such beautiful turn of phrase and omg even use correct grammar etc etc but think understand what the writer be try to provide for all of us who be this strongly affect by the movie first of all writer need to select an audience and this guy sure pick doozy of one it must be the hard audience to try to entertain it take one to know one so he must be like all the others of us who have write comment m base this claim upon have skim 20 comment believe that his script be aim at the mind of everyone who can almost always anticipate minimum of 90 of the twist and turn in any plot and often even the exact dialog that will appear on the screen within the next 15 second to 120 minute or so it so easy to watch movie and roll your eye because the people who collaborate on script weren as empathic intelligent creative or nontraditional as you be but for someone to actually be this successful in touch the most untouchable audience of all with his first movie script well we all good keep our eye on this guy oh and although could hammer so many aspect of the film love that in my case my usual ability to predict what would come next dropped from 90 to maybe 20 there be nobody in an audience as sophisticated as this who hasn know all their life about the basic concept underlie this movie but ask your self this what might the movie have be like if scriptwriter like this hadn write it would the surprising impact this script have upon you have inspire you to leave any comment whatsoever
too much stiller not enough anybody else go to see night at the museum not hop for masterpiece but expect to be entertain ala have my hope set too high one would think that in film with steve coogan ricky gervais mickey rooney dick van dyke robin williams and owen wilson would be fill to the brim with great comedic performance but there be only one actor with any significant screen time who be allow to let loose with his performance and that be ben stiller an unfunny guy whose reputation be build on the back of funny co star such as cameron diaz andy dick janeane garafalo and his father jerry stiller the premise of the film take from child book by milan trenc be that ben stiller be divorce dad who take job as the new night watchman at the new york museum of natural history in order to prove to his son that he isn an unemployable loser due to an ancient egyptian talisman on display at the museum all the exhibit come to life after closing time and he must make sure they don make mess or leave the museum before dawn unfortunately for him he not very good at either of these duty unfortunately for me as viewer be subject to nearly two hour of his awful mugging and wooden one liner in the 1990 robin williams specialize in these type of film g mrs doubtfire jumanji and manage to elicit guffaw from the dry preachy material but now that he too old to play the father of kid who not even in middle school yet he be relegate to be still fatherly adviser as teddy roosevelt which he play without his trademark comic genius instead we have ben stiller in the lead and although he be not list as producer director or screenwriter one get the sense that stiller be the guy in charge during the making of the movie he be in almost every scene and most of the shot in this film be close ups of his face and the casting of anne meara stiller mother as an employment counselor would probably not have take place if stiller be merely the lead actor on this project realize the precede paragraph make the movie sound bad than it really be there be good thing about it will give the film maker credit that this film although appropriate for kid be not strictly child movie the camera work be uniformly great the cgi special effect while not lotr quality be good than those of many other effect base film e the chronicle of narnia the second star war trilogy and do chuckle at owen wilson as jed the miniature cowboy unfortunately the visual goody take back seat to stiller performance and plot with more hole than swiss cheese and wilson role be much too small no pun intend in recent year we have see lot of film such as toy story the rookie and elf that prove that you can make film for kid without dumbing thing down night at the museum be not one of those film instead it be dull silly ego trip for an untalented actor who can only dream about be as funny as the people he work with 6 out of 10
nothing special be with the minority who think this film be overhyped thought it mediocre at best although the diner scene be cool if this be masterpiece fear cinema be go to hell in handbasket casino be ten times the movie pulp fiction be

doesn offer lot of what it promise almost all marvel character have their own fan base include the less know one out of this group elektra stand right in the middle comic book fan and viewer alike remember her from daredevil 2003 but her presence wasn the main focus nor be her character arc give much material to work with but for those who enjoy her appearance fan be surprise to find their female antihero have chance to have her own story tell separately two year later it one of those time where this kind of attention could help boost popularity of the character or trash it completely sadly this follow up to the already mixed feeling that ben affleck daredevil 2003 have leave behind didn help leave any sympathy for this when it be release really want to give it slightly above positive rating but there be various reason to why it just doesn satisfy like it say it would the story attempt at keep fan happy by have scene that directly connect it to daredevil 2003 but then immediately stray away off it elektra jennifer garner end up be reborn from her death cause by bullseye and from then on life as an assassin for hire one day when call upon what seem to be another routine target elektra begin to realize that there more than meet the eye jennifer garner work as elektra her figure and face be attractive along with her ability to perform the required action sequence the cast do contain few familiar face but the rest isn memorable nor be they give any depth accompany elektra be her agent mccabe colin cunningham who have couple of comical line but other than that doesn have much of background to why and how he decide to help her elektra also come into contact with father and daughter play by goran visnjic and kirsten prout respectively both of which also do not give performance that be anything that ll stick as memorable the motivation to both character be wafer thin and write as if they should have emotional attachment by the end of the movie but don convey it it very difficult for an audience to feel attached and invest in character that be throw in just as plot device how be it that the three writer one of which zak penn write for men 2 2003 couldn make screenplay that felt any less original making thing even more confusing be the power that elektra now have instead of just be an assassin elektra now have the ability to see possible future event and visualize where her opponent be that be out of her physical sight when be these special power give to her just because this movie be under marvel do not mean every main character have to have super power this be just another element that make the movie feel very generic because it try to be like every other superhero movie sometimes be extremely skilled be all character need look at the punisher or batman film they don have super power and they get by in life just fine with whatever skill they learn through their adult life all elektra need be her sais and her ninja like skill and she good to go but perhaps the more frustrating part about the story telling be how reliant it be on flashback there be numerous dream sequence that attempt to show that elektra be tragic character but all it do be create confusion and possible annoyance because of how frequently they keep reoccurring the familiar face the audience will recognize be terence stamp who play elektra blind sensei name stick honestly stamp doesn even look like he act blind at time which feel weird because stamp be an accomplished actor audience will also see an uncredited jason isaac who give audience brief background to elektra reborn mystery play the main villain father be roshi play by cary hiroyuki tagawa he always nice actor to see on screen although in this movie his presence have no importance what so ever then there be will yun lee who play the main antagonist kirigi lee be good at play cool and swift move ninja but again he nothing that truly stand out however when it come to action it be lively like it be state before garner can perform the required action sequence and it awesome when she in the elektra garb even when fight off various underdeveloped and uninspired henchman that follow kirigi it be still fun thankfully also with those action sequence the special effect at least blend nicely with the surroundings there wasn a scene that look out of place or extremely fake however the action be also very sporadic the finale work but it take an awful long time to get there and the action scene in between aren long enough to sustain the rest of the scene entail exposition and flashback there be one other element that work here though and that christophe beck score beck music contain reoccurring theme for elektra and some very deep string action cue that help elevate the action sequence surprisingly even the scene that be suppose to be emotional that aren beck provide the right key to make it sound emotional it a good listening experience for comic book movie sadly the film as whole still middle between not bad nor good even with action that entertain engage music and an attractive lead the good be equal to its bad component the writing be formulaic generic contains several unexplained detail and have very few performance that stand out weak marvel film that deserve more
impress be an understatement this for me be the movie of all movie and red billabong come in close second it the small thing like choose to use the lens flare to give the film character the costume design so beautifully mastered incorporate the aussie slang carefully pick choice of character and stunning location well do
peckinpah and mcqueen fuse together for tough outlaw road movie base on jim thompson novel the getaway find director sam peckinpah and king of cool actor steve mcqueen turn to hard grit drama after the sedate splendour of junior bonner earlier in the year doc mccoy be release early from prison due to some string pulling from influential gangster jack benyon however it come under condition that mccoy pull off bank robbery for the gruff smarmy benyon thus the seed be sow for double cross murder cross country pursuit adultery and carnage peckinpah style steve mcqueen be excellent as mccoy few actor can claim to look so good when pop off pump action shotgun or shoot pistol complete with arm recoil and here he have peckinpah to maximise the damage whilst poetically portray the slow mo death sequence al lettieri be vile thug rudy butler who be in hot pursuit of mccoy his wife carol wonderful weasel turn full of cold abusive charm that reek of menace sadly the film be let down touch by the performance of ali macgraw as carol it a terribly wooden performance that threaten to undo all the good thing in the film but luckily mcqueen manages to ease her thru the production to minimise the damage this of course be the film where both of them fell madly in love and end up get marry to each other the chemistry be good but it just that macgraw delivery of her line lack emotion or fortitude peckinpah disagree with the critic of the time even send letter to macgraw praise her effort however when she turn up for the shoot unable to drive car he be less than pleased since her character be the getaway driver full of fine sequence and bloody scenario it stand up as real good sam peckinpah picture it a kind of city set western where the outlaw be actually come across as hero we get pull into this couple world and we want so much for them to achieve their goal so add that feel to the gritty structure of the story and you get real enjoyable piece benefit from great work from director and charismatic lead man alike 8 10
a must have for aspire dancer ve be in love with this film since it come out in mid 80s be dance choreographer in high school the story be fresh inspiring and even though people think it cheesy by today standard or back then the romance and pure ambition of then unknown cast who be great dancer be uplifting and make you root for them till the end of the story the soundtrack be hit and remember know every lyric by heart dance to the upbeat tune as you watch and listen rush of good nostalgia come in sure acting may be bad and corny but it give you heady rush you can help but think sidney poitier just want to have fun when he direct this needless to say be addict to this movie then have the moldy vhs the cassette tape and the move well copy the choreography in school in short it be feel good inspirational story for artist and performer even until now if you can get hold of copy that be because watch clip on youtube just isn enough no one ever do similar musical film where you don worry that your kid will catch it on late night cable with sex scene fill in between plus the song be so danceable and the simple plot memorable never mind the cheesy warmer listen to the tune today and they will still be as likable as yesterday still have video of it now in my file friend convert his copy to avi when suddenly crave for it sometime in 2008 and couldn find it on the net it something sir sidney will remember with pride and joy in his lifetime same fond memory that will sweep the 80s generation who still remember it fondly sometimes would take short peek and my tear would well up because remember my prime as performer even as now see glare little flaw in un synchronized movement and lousy dialog all too clearly never mind small stuff for musical movie this be 80s top

a strained plot with lot of good talent and little emotional sincerity the only living boy in new york 2017 surprise from film hadn heard about it flaw it have some gaffe in the writing and it use some overused idea include the whole world of writer write about be writer but the acting be good and the sentiment be keep in check most of the time so that it work overall enjoyable if nothing remarkable there be surprising number of known actor here from pierce brosnan to wallace shawn briefly callum turner the lead man the only living boy be likable but weak link overall he be mean to be in crisis on every level and he kind of show it but you feel something miss in the performance and maybe the writing ah the writing this be movie about writer and there be so many clichés here you can fill salt shaker with them yeah we love interpersonal drama and the troubled mom and the troubled dad and the unlikely wise old man next door not to mention the utterly improbably girlfriend who isn a girlfriend but who hang on steadily anyway it a mashup of heart tug type and our star be in the middle navigate it all with really no rudder or you might say that jeff bridge be his rudder he a cliché too of course but his wisdom be good enough to give the movie some depth d say the smart of kate beckinsale character the mistress lover with troubled past and surprisingly steady head on her shoulder rise above the rest her performance be spot on too the upshot here be that the movie have lot of little thing to like and the plot which be riddle with little annoy emotional trick still have some honesty to it and you ll likely enjoy it all for what it be

wonderful effort from first time writer director zack braff really love this movie mean really so it surprise me to come here and find it rat so low by no mean be this perfect movie it can be slow or awkward from time to time and there be one or two moment that just don work but by and large be really impressed it a great little story with just the right balance of comedy and drama full of quirky character and interesting performance ian holm demand attention as always and natalie portman sam while offputting at first definitely grow on me as she grow into real character but the real story here be zack braff it should surprise no one who have ever watch scrub that his performance keep the movie together or that he be able to create jokey distant somewhat sarcastic character who also elicit real empathy from the audience and manage to emanate deep wound what amazes me be the work he have do here as first time writer director first off there be an actual narrative here with meaning and relevance too often the big hollywood movie will have plot that resolve itself but mean nothing on the flip side independent movie almost seem to disdain plot for mood and thematic concern braff be able to weave both together difficult task for young writer the dialogue be witty plot situation intelligent and creative and overall the writing be just good as for his directing there be few odd choice m still not sure like one scene the main character be scream into deep ravine and the camera sweep away into say ravine it just toss me out of the movie bit m also not completely sure what to make of the movie end which win go into further except to say that felt it almost change the focus of the movie up to that point and make it about something else however there be moment of absolutely beauty as well here the entire scene where sam and andrew talk in his friend pool have some great shot and braff comedic flair and timing be evident in his directing style which still manage to pull back for the more dramatic and poignant moment urge you to see this movie it not big movie it be never mean to be but have little doubt that once it find an audience it will be remember for year to come sort of modern day graduate with more hopeful outlook on life
brilliant where to start the witty dialogues the intriguing plot the character study the superb act from the three protagonist they all collaborate for highly entertaining film who will capture you from begin to end one of the best film ve ever see and wonder why the rating here be so low

just tiresome spectacle ok we ve get these two movie entity alien and predator what would happen if they face off against each other this sound like something cliff klaven and norm peterson would discuss as they swill beer at cheer bunch of rich guy decide it be necessary to investigate some heat come out of the ground in antarctica they spend whole bunch of money to see what there they also hand pick group of disparate character to investigate it be the usual assemblage of clash personality they be also terribly short sight and pretty incompetent of course once the alien and predator arrive on the scene the human become thing to be kill those bad boy begin to do their thing base on their particular property and then it over guess this be just another case of lack of imagination and an anything for buck mentality
most overrated movie ever make ohhh boy why this be more than 9 0 in imdb to start with rarely wright review for movie but after see this awful awful movie have decide to tell the truth about this piece of garbage the movie start very slow with cheesy production and laughable dialogue and once the climax supposedly should come the movie just skip it as nothing happen it very clear that the director have no clue on what be he do or what be the direction of the movie the setup be bad will give you very good example when akshay go to iraq to meet with the official the cast be wear uae national dress be they suppose to wear an iraqi custom what be the movie maker think one of my big problem also with the movie be the character of the iraqi military guy how on earth you put an indian to portray an iraqi officer they cant find any arab speaking actor and ohh my god that character be really bad and not believable at all this be ultimately without doubt one of the bad movie have ever see in my life from bad act dialogue horrible director cheap production everything scream bad from this movie the most overrated movie ever ever ever
it be as bad as everyone assume it would be have to admit ve be curious about this film since learn joseph gordon levitt my favorite current actor be cast as the villain of the 1980s cartoon series kind of expect it to be not very good but there have be small amount of buzz come out since the day it premier mostly say thing like it not as bad as you think but some actually declare it to be decent big dumb fun action flick and let face it this summer have leave us hurt for that type of movie unfortunately i joe doesn fit the bill at least for me d place the fault mostly with the act like so many of these kind of action flick it be pretty much superhero movie the good guy be extremely boring compare to the bad guy this one be especially bad in that respect not only be they boring couple of the good guy straight up want to die channing tatum be the lead and he god awful call him block of wood would be insult to formerly live organism if have know marlon wayans be in the picture may have at least waited for video as always he only here to provide painful comic relief dennis quaid can be welcome addition to some movie but very often he there just to cash check and be really bad this be one of those time the only joe who even worth have on screen be rachel nichols as scarlett probably just because of the awesome red hair dye job of course she cute and isn a completely crappy actress all of the villain be fairly interesting byung hun lee have good presence as storm shadow far more than his joe counterpart pouty lipped snake eye play by the always mute ray darth maul park sienna miller breast steal the movie every time they appear she not half bad actress either and levitt be by far the best thing about the movie mean the role be pretty crappy and he doesn necessarily seem like he belong but he have fun with it at least the film do contain one pretty awesome action sequence chase through paris with the villain race to destroy the eiffel tower it might have be wise to avoid show it fall in all the promotional material because that be the film big moment it well choreograph and you can actually see what go on unlike so many action sequence these day most of the rest of the action sequence don live up to that one though and the finale be just cheap rip off of the star war movie
never really liked yu gi oh and this movie reflect that empty story with very little plot development motif felt weak and mostly uninterest the entire time one good note the final battle be engage until it keep on go

nolan and bale win christian bale do great job bring this franchise back to life bb bring the darkness of legend of the dark knight combine with strong act from the entire cast nolan doesn wander to far from the comic batman we all know and love for one hope nolan sign on for the next flick the story telling be strong though all three act with no miss that can see there be plenty in the story for true batman fan as well as the casual movie goer for one would like to see the entire cast sign on for the next flick as believe that what cause the first franchise to dwindle with clooney like him as batmaneven with the weird suit
start off good then go downhill very fast first 20mins of this be like yes ancient weird skeleton shrine and possessed people in the middle of nowhere then it turn into completely different film have to check be still watch the same film completely switch off and start potter about the house it be that bore love horror love weird in depth horror but this don bother waste your time
i be expect much bad cgi live action movie from the director of garfield 2 also once again movie with loser dad character and some very bad child okay they be chipmunk but behave just as child as they be kid like daddy day camp and others actually the chipmunk make all the difference and save the movie what do not work with garfield warm hollywood emotion and the animal as fast rock star type work perfectly with the chipmunk also their animation be never off set as it quite often be with garfield and even after almost 50 year it still make you smile to hear them sing when you watch the trailer you can see that poo eat part which see be in the movie just to bring in that type of audience think it be bad idea as it make others think twice before buy ticket for this movie which have only one fart joke and this poo joke of this type of humour otherwise it be watchable and the animated character be even lovable jason lee be not so great in this it be fun travel back in the time when watch them as child not big movie also there be problem with the pacing but it much well than expect
as time go by found this to be an interesting film certainly not bore as have heard from few people who saw it in the theater to me it be simply good storytelling yes it slow especially by today movie standard but it certainly unique story and it nicely film acted and direct story wise it one of those film understand if people love it or hate it m somewhat in the middle and lean toward the positive for movie that run for over 2 hour and 40 minute and be not some suspense or action film it have to be pretty good to hold one interest can only speak for myself it hold my interest for 95 percent of it think the first two third of the movie be the best brad pitt as benjamin button be pretty fascinating as be the story of him grow up from wrinkle old man baby to mid 40s guy when he re unites with childhood friend daisy cate blanchett and become her lover the film bog down in few spot but few people be go to stop watching after invest two hour it pick up again especially in the last minute when benjamin begin to finally become young than an adult there a sadness to this story especially near the end but overall even though it central theme seem to be death don think it a depressing film it do remind us in big way that the long we re around the more death of friend and loved one we witness that just sad fact of life hear about it all time with my father who be 91 year old and have see almost all of his friend die it especially true in this story when benjamin start off and have lot of old friend to begin with benjamin be an odd person to me you could root for him yet not admire him he often treat people only to satisfy his desire and could have be so much more yet be fly on the wall and observe his interesting life be memorable make this film worthy of the time invest to watch it in the end the movie make me appreciate the friend do have and not to take any of them for grant as life pass us by so fast no matter what direction we re head

i hate it well first off hate musical and dance movie so its no brainer that this movie be not for me can say nothing good about it the acting be crap plot be as cornball as one can get and it doesn appeal to me also can not stand any patrick swayze movie to date that weigh in heavily the only reason have see this movie be because when be young there be only one v so not much choice with an old sister and mother who love this movie want to bust the tape can not ever sit through this movie this definetly not for anyone who do not like musical or dance movie trust me avoid at all cost

after the movie mirror one would think that scary movie about mirror aren scary refuse to join the consensus to say that this be good movie overall it be bore snooze fest that should have be release straight to video thank god that attend an advance free screening so the movie be about woman that go on mission to destroy mirror that have history of kill others by supernatural force the premise sound promising but that be where it end the movie get off to slow start with extensive monotony but end up become more melodramatic with incessant tear the acting must say that the acting be pretty good my only complaint be the continuous cry that make me question if be watch horror or chick flick the character be well commit to their role especially the mother play by katee sackhoff other than that the script be their downfall really think that this be suppose to be horror film when one think of horror you expect some scare jump and overall fright none of this come to pass for me the movie use the same played supernatural character that we ve all see before without any element of surprise where the ingenuity maybe go into the movie with too high of expectation but should have know that this plot have be use before mirror 2008 usually could say more about movie but there not much to say but why even one of the movie goer in my theater felt the same sentiment he start snore mid way during the movie yes others start yell at him again it seem like m the only one that didn like this movie but highly recommend that you wait until it come on dvd
garbage for the real fan gold for everyone else ever since the first movie trailer leak out on to the airwave everyone think the simpson movie be go to be the big thing to hit us this summer unfortunately this movie fail on so many level that it sad it the hank scorpio episode remixed and stretch out into movie the character in this movie take such dramatic turn from their old self that all we re leave with be exploit and annoy failure homer be turn from the classic oaf with big heart for his child into brainless jerk who rely heavily on slapstick comedy bart be turn from bad boy into emotional drunk and lisa go from the smart voice of reason into the nagging voice of self righteousness it garbage and it 85 minute of it use the same joke we saw year ago though it not as bad as the last couple of season that you may have see on television but at least you weren charge for that the film in my honest opinion would have be pretty good if it be make for v movie and air on v but the fact that have to pay nine dollar for it make it pure garbage like so many disappointed fan have write before me want refund and if you pay for it you ll want one to
what let down be in my 40 and big sci fi fan it be really odd that have never see this movie till now and have to say it wasn worth the wait wont argue that the film be very artfully shot but the story be slow and just bizarre of course bizarre be what film student and art critic love so m not surprise that this be so highly think of and m sure they spend many an evening pouring over the plot try to find hidden meaning that aren really there sometimes cigar be just cigar sometimes slow and dated plot be just slow and date plot if you watch movie not to make yourself look intelligent but rather heaven forbid to be entertain give this one miss
best sci fi in long long time highly recommend have never write review although ve have an imdb account for long time give all the new sci fi show try but end up not follow most so have good idea of what out there for fan most new sci fi be unscientific to put it kindly or just techy stage furniture with soap opera dialogue and character development like most fan what want to watch be great sci fi story that seriously take into consideration the effect of technology on the world around us and intelligently explore the possible future of humanity m also interested by story that consider the social issue of an alternative world shape by different force what would happen if say people live on different planet or if water be scarce or if you have to live in 0g all your life know no sci fi will ever rise to the standard of physic phd but it would be nice if writer occasionally pay attention to one this review be base solely on one episode so hopefully this be not fluke but the quality and write be outstanding good than most good high budget movie just base on this and the fact that it be genuinely science fiction do with care which show great attention to detail and love for the project think this show should get the best word of mouth it can get warmly recommend it to everyone
moment of menace the economy austerity and directness of the film of fritz lang make him one of the most profound and precise filmmaker lang master of the german expressionist film shoot his first talkie crime drama consider landmark in the story of suspense movie it be shock idea for its time base on the real life killer peter kurten headline as the vampire of düsseldorf be about terrorized city and plump little man with wide eye often chew candy who be pathological child killer unable to control his urge for kill the film embody several lang theme the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menace anticipation of watch helplessly trap individual try fruitlessly to escape as great force move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it add new dimension to suspense pity for the killer be clearly mentally sick he can not overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunt down and almost lynch as criminal rather than treat as sick man early in the film the killer be hear whistle the grieg theme from in the hall of the mountain king this theme inexorably become imbue with menace and when we see no more than girl look in shop window the melody on the sound track tell us chillingly that the murderer be there just out of sight the murderer be play by peter lorre in virtuoso performance that have barely be match in all the thriller he have make since casablanca the maltese falcon and the mask of dimitrios when the photograph of his victim all little girl be show to him he jump back and twitch with horror with powerful visuals lang motion picture be lorre first film his performance as the corpulent hunt psychopath be masterpiece of mime and suggestion lorre be the archetypal outsider outside the law and society because of his compulsive crime outside the balance society of the underworld because he be not professional criminal he have only twelve line of dialog in the most famous of all about pathological killer alfred hitchcock psycho anthony perkins lack not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre but also the dimension of invoke our incredulous sympathy psycho reek with blood and horror whereas the suspense of be subtle child balloon without an owner roll ball be enough to tell us that another murder have be commit the audience trap in its seat tear by ambivalent feeling towards the killer watch him trap as the net be pull tight
the definition of 7 star rating the premise be very good and interesting and the story capture you right away the acting be solid and the movie overall be definitely worth the time it be also dark and bloody but it make be point and leave you think about capitalism survival and people be people however the end doesn match the expectation plot hole be an issue an issue that can be fill with interpretation but still think they could deliver good
predictable and low budget but kind of endear let me start off by say this if you re expect believable effect or top notch act maybe set your hope little low this movie be definitely what you might expect from one of the old scifi original movie low budget with passable but sometimes cheesy dialogue and actor that aren terrible but aren go to be get any nomination either the best acting in this movie be do by the little girl character and even then it not spectacular but if you just want to waste some time with so bad it funny kind of horror movie or be just really really emotionally affect by the thought of endanger animal turn into zombie you might get small cheap kick out of it do even despite how lackluster it be the cgi isn great and there a scene where one character be hold up in the air by zombie animal and her body position look laughably fake but if you can manage to ignore that it entertain enough overall not the bad movie ve ever see it have potential and you can tell there be some heart in it but not enough to make up for the lack of budget still if you ve get an hour and half to kill and don mind cheesy low budget horror it not terrible and just barely worth watch
the limitation of goof around this be prime example of what could have only looked liberating at its particular moment in time when the spirit of 60s youth be start to really take off but hadn really find its own voice yet very few year later this kind of glorified home movie would look like an average student project not recipe for bold new american cinema but at the time it be something rare simply for be non exploitation american independent feature anad offer break from hollywood formula the pretext you can really call it plot be that the two young hero have take too long court their love vera play by two different actress to represent the different way the see her so she go ahead and marry someone else they retreat to the wood to get over it or something while there be flashback to their failed romancing and vera protective nagging parent but really all that happen be that the lead perform amateur slapstick about on the level of the filler montages on the monkees couple year later make funny face and run around sometimes discreetly naked in the snow lot with the recklessness of youth sometimes the silliness be heighten by slo mo fast mo and other simple trick the film would seem completely rudderless and formless if not for the diverse original music score which be far good than it deserve and whose composer also score number of other offbeat film the performer be game and couple of them have the kind of look that might have work in professional context nut very quickly their repetitious antic grow no more interesting than watch teenager cannonball at your neighbor pool party high spirit alone aren automatically compel you actually need some idea and structure to create art or even just entertainment hallelujah the hill be historical curio of value but it very hard to argue that it be successful as either art or entertainment it just some people glorify home movie lark admittedly one whose camera manage that manage to stay in focus the whole time that briefly seem special because back then almost nobody be glorify their home movie yet if you think the similar beat goof off fest beat my daisy be one of the great film of all time you might actually think more of hallelujah than do m glad finally saw it but can imagine ever want to again
very good thought provoke davidson acting be excellent the subject of grief loss pain and its effect on child be address in very sensitive manner still manage to have many funny situation worth watch
a cinematic phenomenon what can possibly add to review corpus of over 1 2 million rating and three thousand review this movie have be call one of the best movie of all time powerful story about friendship hope and freedom and latter day retelling of the gospel story many people have see this movie multiple time and some claim it have change their life and even save their life at this point m rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie my take on it this movie appeal enormously to ordinary people especially american men who feel trap by difficult situation in their life some may be look to be rescue like red be others may take comfort in the thought that their long term pain tedium and oppression will someday result in spectacular liberate event this movie satisfyingly scratch that annoy itch call life be unfair it difficult to know what to think about all this whatever you think about the phenomenon shawshank redemption be also just good movie with excellent write black and white character simple but satisfy plot with few surprising scene great acting and certain amount of tear jerk it not movie to be miss 8
suspenseful buildup less satisfying resolution in the house of the devil young co ed jocelin donahue hard up for money to pay the rent on her new place off campus answer an ad for babysitting job way out in the boonies only to be plunge headlong into bizarre devil worship cult in search of sacrificial victim set in the 1980s in time before cell phone give us at least the illusion of connectedness and security this refreshingly unadorned and unembellished thriller do something rather unique with its structure possibly necessity bring on by its extremely low budget the story come to such slow boil that the stretch out tension become almost unbearable thereby enhance the atmosphere of dread unfortunately die hard slasher movie fan may be disappoint by the rather rush truncate and anticlimactic nature of the final scene in which our heroine find herself be hold captive by some of the most feckless and least competent kidnapper in horror movie history still the suspenseful buildup be more than compensation for the half bake and halfhearted resolution that follow
good not great and slowish love the main actor actually all the main character something felt like it be miss the baddie be somehow make redundant why be they chase the her the first scene baffle me she exhibit power to escape from what or who in some way the plot felt the wrong way around it be enjoyable but not great worth watch
not as good as the review claim leave review because m blow away at the amount of 9 and 10 i see for this movie do you all have kid movie on different scale to me movie be movie and this be good for kid movie but still incredibly formulaic with an obvious end guess we ll have to see how much low the score go for this movie as at the time of this review its 9 10 but its still just shock to me to see it that high even though it early it truly be pixar 8th best movie at most and it an alright idea but at the end of the day it just check all the box average movie and that okay it an alright kid movie but it doesn deserve the praise people be shower it with
a fantastic in depth and though provoking film one of the best romantic movie of the last decade eternal sunshine of the spotless mind be love story about two lover who undergo procedure to erase each other from one another memory but when they meet after their memory be go there be something strange still draw them together and it be also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really be eternal sunshine of the spotless mind be one of those film where you have to pay close attention to the scene and dialog because even the small bit of dialog be important in this film because otherwise you will be confuse in your initial viewing and will soon be ask yourself what in the world be go on this film require close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewing in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly be the film be not your basic love story it be unique and sort of bizarre at the same time and while it be not suspense movie it be fill with several shock moment and twist which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigue by it the narrative part of the love story be also tell in reverse chronological order which start from the moment the lover break up and end when they first meet while the present scene be tell in normal order the film constantantly switch back and forth between the two which may create some confusion another one of the reason that this film require close attention at first you will probably be confuse about what you be see be the present or the past but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart the way the narrative be similar to mememto which also follow reverse chronological order of storytelling the storytelling be clever and interesting and only make the film well and it twist more shocking and intriguing act wise jim carrey be in truman show mode or probably the most serious he have ever be in film this be probably the most serious role he have ever do and he shin in his role as joel barish and be completely into his character kate winslet also perform excellently well and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence be do extremely well the support cast do not get that much screen time but they be perform their role well kirsten durst and mark ruffalo be good but the scene between them in the apartment be kind of drawn out and could have do without few of them but elijah wood be really great in his role as patrick and scene between him and clementine be also interest the end be also great because it leave it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the event that lead up to the end be also very interesting and intrigue the soundtrack be also great and suit most of the scene it be be play in the opening and closing credit song be also fantastic and also wonderfully portray the relationship between clementine and joel the ice setting be not something be fond of before watch the film but it be handle extremely well here with the scene of clementine and joel laying on ice be one of the most touching and memorable moment of this film overall eternal sunshine of the spotless mind be touch in depth and intriguing love story with such great plot setting performance and memorable moment that can watch this film over and over again and never get bore however you may need to watch this film multiple time to fully understand it plot and the message it be try to convey and appreciate it for what it truly be
okay movie but not masterpiece like the review make it out to be city of god be one of the high rated movie here on imdb which have me ask the question why yes it have some intense scene endear act and interesting usage of camera angle but other than that city of god be unremarkable my first and main complaint about city of god be the high number of character there be so many different character who all look very similar that it become hard to follow what be go on in the story with so many different character it be also difficult to make connection with any one of them be on the fence when it come to the cinematography of city of god think during some of the scene the camera angle and filter be very clever in convey certain mood on the other hand sometimes these aspect felt unnecessary and almost seem as though the filmmaker be just experiment around overall don think city of god be as great as be lead to believe in some instance it feel like cheaply make movie plus the run time be much too long the filmmaker probably should have cut some character and subplots out of the film to focus more on the main character
could have be well really it could have my personal opinion of lohan aside this movie like others dead silence for one rely heavily on effect that at time become quite distract some of the shot in the film be beautiful but the use of blue be really overdone some of the special effect be lack and some of the weapon be just ridiculous the big blue glass knife be you kid me whether you see symbolism in the use of colour depends on the viewer mindset but even so the use of blue be just overwhelm at time this be probably the point but it start to distract from the plot the acting be alright for the most part lohan do good job the parent aren very convincing and at time the dialog become stale and somewhat corny however the movie be easy enough to follow that people who don like complex horror film can sit back and enjoy the ride if you do prefer bite more mystery you ll have this figure out about halfway through and the end will seem to drag the big plot twist at the end be original enough however for me it seem like cop out it work fine it just not quite as exciting as it could have be kind of left me think oh that all there a small bit of nudity sex scene and lot of dirty dance so if your decision rest on one of those thing now you know surprisingly there be several gory scene as well wouldn recommend bring small child to see this though doubt that will stop some people from bring their kid along it isn scary but the gore in some part might be bit much for young audience or people who really can deal with it it nothing like saw or hostel in the area of gore but there be couple scene that make me flinch in the end the film really didn bring anything new to the table the storyline be simple and easy to follow some of the shot be nice and the act on whole be mediocre at bad so if you have nothing well to do it an alright film to waste an hour or so with but don go expect an award winner you ll be leave disappointed
with this cast hop for more so there daniel craig do southern accent why do they think english aussie can do american dialect except for hugh laurey do generic american accent why not hire an merican and if need one who grow up in that dialect get past that the 1st episode be painful and force myself through expect it can be this bad give up
one of the most inane and dated movie of our time remember watch this movie when it first come out and do not know what to think mean it be different could not remember see dialog like this before or scene where guy cut another guy 39 ear off it be unique in that regard mind you it be different but not really special moreover some part be very bore other part be so quot talky quot and somewhat over the top that they strain credibility however there be some funny line as well after have watch this again some ten year later can say with all honesty this film have not age well on second look you see what look like first year film student project it still have funny line but the story be paper thin the actor tend to over act and the dialog be so full of clint eastwood wannabe one liner that you just roll your eye michael madsen can not act sorry he be cool but he can not act tim roth 39 attempt at an american accent make him sound like ralph cramden from the honeymooner be just amaze at how bad this film really look to more mature person the funny line just don 39 cover that constant posturing of character that have no real depth the movie be cotton candy it look fill but be far from it perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this quot cool film quot high mark but fear it will grow more ridiculous the old get however tarantino have this cult of personality go and be sure the 10s will continue come in for this film and 10 might mean perfect in here but that don 39 make it so
could have be good even magic caper movie need some sense of reality this movie be so full of hole and unbelievable situation it almost funny if one can really see it as fantasy film then fine you ll enjoy it if one want any coherency skip it spoiler alert the twist could have work if what the ruffulo character do be believable but there be so many instance that the writer have him do that do not justify the end too bad because the photography music and even some of the acting be just fine the story should have be completely re write film be also very choppy and it look like scene be film and cut or should have be write and film be tire of jesse eisenberg play the same character in every movie in which he appear his acting range be b give somebody else with real talent chance at his role
and they say the first movie be an insult to the victor hugo book damn this word limit d heard the review and comment of this movie none of them even come anywhere near close to truly do justice to how much of an abomination this horrible sequel it be my second favorite disney film of all time have just be utterly ruin by the thought of such lame boring and anticlimactic sequel feel like ve just see close friend get bludgeon to death and just sit there and watch in horror how can they take the wondrous animation of the original which think look good than anything and turn out with something that look bad than youtube flash animation in the sequel it look downright lazy with how choppy it be and phoebus what have they do to him he be an utter jackass with no real explanation here at least when simba be like that in the lion king ii he have damn good reason to be so and what do they do to esmarelda design she look horrid compare to her original counterpart and her eye be blue they re suppose to be green idiot animator green as in emeralds hence her name we clearly saw esmarelda green eye in broad daylight before they be never blue at any point in the original so what happen here oh and the villain dear god what pathetic waste of animation you re tell me that this insufferable idiot of magician be suppose to be the successor to judge frollo of all people frollo be amongst the most complex of any disney villain ever conceive he be interest lustful deceptive dishonest and he burn paris to the ground because he think he be some sort of soldier for god he follow what the church do but not what it say he be so great but here it just circus owner who want bell that it nothing more disappointing doesn even begin to cover what that be not to mention really hate use this term to describe thing don like and hear others use it but have no choice in this case the villain be both figuratively and literally gay his unsettling love for himself be just uncomfortable to watch and his voice be absolutely unbearable the only positive that have be that the background look nice and that quasimodo and madaline do have some legit good chemistry but even then that flaw quasimodo meet her once and then after she run off from him be ugly he start sing about marry the girl what that rush even by disney standard their romance last three day tops and it happen literally immediately for comparison look at kiara and kovu once again from tlkii they didn even start to fall in love until the 2 day mark and even then they know each other since childhood so they have brief yet impactful friendship to build it upon where be that in the hunchback of notre dame ii where ask oh and that another thing how could they take the hunchback of notre dame one of the most complex deep and rich disney story ever tell and follow it up with something so simplistic that it insult to its own intelligence all that happen be the villain steal bell and that doesn even happen until 45 minute in the whole movie be only 58 minute long too so the conflict rise action climax fall action and resolution all happen in the span of time that regular spongebob episode would last in sequel to one of the best animated story ever tell until the climax it be so degradingly bore that almost didn make it through and although the romance have good chemistry still can fathom the principle of quasimodo get the girl in the end one of the reason hunchback be my second favorite disney movie of all time be because it be one of the few disney flick where the main character doesn get marry in the end he walk away with self respect dignity and the pride that he have save all of paris from frollo in that awesome final battle scene here they just take that and chuck it out the window for an oh so typical disney trope and ruin one of quasimodo best trait as character could they just not handle have even one of their character go without get the girl in the end so they can keep in line with that tired tradition and the girl they give him wasn even worthy either she not horrible but it incredibly underwhelming how she have no personality traits outside of be clumsy and stupid also why be none of the event of the last movie even mention at all frollo be not acknowledge by name once not once man who burn paris to the ground lie to quasimodo all his life and keep him lock in the bell tower for 20 year and convince him that he be horrible creature who ll never be love be not even hint at as though the last movie never even happen you could ve take out frollo all together and it wouldn have make difference there no continuation of his action no consequence no shot of paris rebuilding after his attack nothing just when thing like the lion king ii and aladdin and the king of thief give me hope that disney sequel have another brighter side to them then come this suppose those select few really be the only good one out there my faith in future disney sequel have be greatly reduce if not shatter now all together bottom line this be one of the bad thing ve ever see in my life
simple but entertain short but sweet be probably the best way to describe this movie unlike other epic create by studio ghibli such as nausicaa of the valley of the wind and spirit away this movie have very simple story and feel more like really long episode of tv show rather than movie the character be somewhat developed but there just wasn much time to do so since the story felt rush however this be still very entertaining film full of subtle humor the only gripe have with this film be that the disney dvd be dubtitled disney forgot to translate the movie and try to pass the script for the english dub as the translated subtitle
best sw think this be the best of the franchise cool bad guy cooler hero jabba the hutt rock my sock felt this film be truest to the sw universe watch this after see force awakens and honestly feel that the new film don do justice to these classic
a story about two mentally ill people in short this movie be another hollywood echo chamber it saturate with self reference and channel itself so out of touch with reality and narcissistic quite symptomatic really thank god they give us clue in the name of their movie for us to have grasp what this movie be about just by look at its name the only reason these two mentally ill dissociate character fell in love with each other in the first place be because they realize this be what they have in common mental illness and dissociation so why the hell not be like this together good than to go through life alone with such misery anyway other than that these two character be strip of any personality to be fair many classic of musical this movie be try hard to channel be guilty of that just like in many musical romantic comedy hollywood trope these two people be throw out at each other artificially let me get this straight don know any woman who would memorize guy like sebastian and believe they re mean to be together despite the fact that all she know about him be that once he show her middle finger and be shake his head at her in car and later he shove her aside while she be try to compliment his piano play it just doesn work like that it be good at mechanistically channel musical and hollywood but it be do so unenthusiastically know that musical movie tend to have lack of good singing because they usually take famous actor with little to no musical background to play but in this case maybe the film could benefit from good singing and dancing if the script and idea be so bad and no sebastian you re not play jazz you re just play one mediocre pop song that be style as vintage big theme of this movie be follow your dream which almost always happen to be dream of make it in the entertainment industry for some reason as if people who watch this can dream of something other than that it interest that many hollywood and disney movie have be have this cliché theme throughout decade big question why kind of get it why many people receive this movie well and believe all the hype and that it deserve oscars one of the reason be of course because they just eat whatever be be feed to them by hollywood and mainstream all the time another one be that large portion of society life in this la la land in our capitalist society people be alienate from reality and they live in fantasy major corporation create for them to escape they also dream about mythical love and have dream like career even their dream be not something they create m say all that because recommend you to read zizek review of la la land
one of the stupid movie ever make this review be go to be full of spoiler because be go to mention various gap plot inconsistency and outright idiocy in this dog of film sure it look great and the special effect be generally well do but some people need their movie to at least make some sense let start with really basic one the planet krypton be go to be destroy and no one can be save except one baby presumably because they don have any spacecraft oh but wait they do have spacecraft in fact they have so much spare technology they use it to send criminal into space so that they will survive and provide enemy for superman later in the movie jor el steal the codex which apparently contain the dna of the kryptonian race somehow there be no backup copy oh but what about the actual kryptonians who be run around destroy thing surely they each have their own dna apparently not somehow and how about that baby make machine in the scout ship what be it suppose to use if there only one codex clark just happen to hear about some top secret ice digging and somehow know to go there how and lois lane be somehow give tour of the dig and free place to stay even though she have to sue to be allow there at all clark discover the spacecraft and somehow know how to pilot it and land it somewhere but then it never get use again for example to help fight the invader later on doesn it have the same kind of engine that need to destroy them and it actually can fly rather than need to be drop via an airplane as clark baby spacecraft be at the end of the film but somehow no one think of this when clark be take to general zod ship he lose his power because he supposedly need the gas in earth atmosphere to gain and retain his power yet he show repeatedly operate in the vacuum of space if he need earth atmosphere to retain his power he should lose them in space in numerous fight scene massive damage be cause to probably inhabited building which must have result in massive loss of life why wouldn clark superman immediately lure his enemy far away from the city fight over the ocean in the mountain etc in one scene he deliberately throw an enemy through bunch of building apparently not care who get hurt at the end when the world engine be work superman fly into its gravity beam where his power shouldn exist because the condition it create be like those of krypton but after be unable to do anything he somehow just decide he go to do it and then instantly destroy the machine because if you really really decide then you can do anything general zod ship will be flip back into the phantom zone if its drive field come in contact with another drive field of the same type as find in clark baby spacecraft but wait don all their small spacecraft use the same engine why don they cause the same problem at the end superman and general zod have an extended fight and appear to be equally match but when zod threaten prototypical family of father mother and child with his heat vision and which he somehow doesn manage to hurt although all he have to do be move his eye slightly superman easily kill him although he be completely unable to damage him until then again just decide to do something make it happen these be just some of the really obvious major problem how about some minor but equally stupid one perry white jenny and steve be walk away from general zor ship when perry say where jenny oh she suddenly stick under rubble that apparently no one notice fall and she hasn bother to scream or make any sound at all they struggle to free her when suddenly the beam stop and they say he save us even though they didn know anything about superman try to save them nor that the destruction wouldn resume or in fact anything about what be go on martha kent be violently flung 20 foot or more but apparently she completely unhurt even though she elderly and even simple fall should have be damage when superman and zor be fight they fly great distance and end up fall through the ceiling of something that look like grand central station after few second lois lane suddenly appear out of nowhere because she should be in that scene in heartwarming scene at the end jonathan kent see young clark play with cape and get all misty eye wait how do he associate kid play with cape with anything at all why would cape signify something to him it wouldn this be movie that didn bother to make any sense and the fact that people accept all the illogic plot hole and dumbness of it really depress me special effect shouldn be enough to make movie popular the story and the logic of the story should count for at least as much and more
who need baldwin basinger when you ve get mcqueen mcgraw steve mcqueen be one of the most naturally talented actor to come along and this movie along with the sand pebbles be one of my favorite mcqueen movie ali mcgraw be excellent much good here as compare to that sappy role she have in love story as his on screen wife team which be use to rob bank but be double cross by the insider who stand to profit from the robbery sally struthers even turn in credible performance as someone exhibit what will later be coin as the stockholm syndrome and the late al lettieri be great as one of their pursuer far well movie than the 1994 remake
anthony hopkins will win best actor anthony hopkins be phenonmenal 100 good than the marvel star
don waste your time it a whole lot of nothing this movie be 113 minute of pure boredom and irritation the story be frustrate no empathy be evoke for the main character the oh so revered plot line serve as bore and make the viewer extremely impatient the plot line be stretch far too long and the disappointing plot twist end neither do amend nor make up for the fluff the writer make throughout the movie this film be like popcorn bag which keep get big and big and then by the end it pop open and there be no popcorn inside just kernels that be this movie bag of kernel
great cinematography bore movie be one of the few people that do not enjoy la la land at all just keep on thinking when will this movie end while it be play it be so boring and predictable glad watch it at time could not watch anything else on plane would not have watch it elsewhere
this movie absolutely suck can remember the last time enjoy movie less than this one the special effect be sub par the acting be horrible and it be about three hour too long running time 3 hour not to mention the fact that the ape change size at least three time and they spend the first two hour of the movie on the island the action sequence last way too long and the outcome of most them be so improbable that find myself roll my eye and check my watch after the first hour of the movie this movie be so corny and sappy that it almost unwatchable truly can not believe how many movie critic be recommend this movie it could have be cut down to less than two hour if there hadn be any of the extraneous crap they put in the movie like the dinosaur do miss that angle on the original or in the remake or in the book where be the fake look dinosaur describe in the novel the actor be also far too aware of themselves and this be the first movie can say that jack black actually suck bad the monkey teeth look like something out of nintendo game and sometimes the airplane fly by him while he be on the empire state building look disproportionately huge compare to him and can really chalk my disappointment up to elevate expectation because have no expectation of this movie if the story have be worth damn they might have salvage this unwatchable piece of crap but they ruin it as far as m concern don believe the hype

an exhausting look at film make admire peter jackson for his gall and his insight but king kong just seem to go overboard with everything the cgi the act the tomfoolery and just the overall bombacity of the film it just seem like too much be put into this film and in the end the viewer get an over expansive film that trip all over its technological greatness will admit the cgi and kong be excellent bring about a new look to the big ape the facial feature and little detail make him very believable in every sense but unfortunately there be lot of boffo background cgi which take the steam out of lot of moment fortunately all of the money be put on the final scene in the movie be little leery of height see the angle and fly over from the airplane be quite exhilarating and the scene on top of the empire state building be something to behold like lot of people felt the movie could have be trim little three hour seem excessive for this film and jackson seem to subtly imply that jack black character be himself struggle to grasp the concept of non gimmick film make king kong be certainly entertaining and worth the 5 50 spent but the film tend to be step back for jackson hopefully he win drown his next vision in cgi as much as he do with this one
please don let there be plan well this movie be all expect it to be adequate if you look at this movie for just another action movie then you will not be disappoint because there be lot of action from the start till the very end and it work quite well for its there be fast paced action here to keep even the most adrenaline addict satisfy now regard to the traditional classic team tv series well there be bit too many change in this movie for my liking and have grow up with watch the team on tv find this movie stale attempt at bring life back to the classic the cast all perform well and do think they have something go on with their choice in actor for the role of course fill out the shoe of george peppard dwight schultz dirk benedict and mr be quite mouthful but still the people in this new movie actually do quite alright one thing that have be shake my head in disbelief be the scene where a be run around dodge fall container from the ship that be too much that scene be so unbelievable and it sort of take the movie experience down notch for me also when the team be depart germany they somehow be in danish terminal know because live here in denmark so know what the terminal look like and know the uniform that be really bad error in the movie especially because denmark and germany be two different country tch tch alright well in overall the movie work quite well as standard action movie it work only adequately as new interpretation of the team story so believe this movie will cause wide array of review give these fact for me the verdict be adequate and score 5 10 rating

useless self indulgent not only be the great rock roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate but when it come down to it not much about it be interesting or even entertaining malcolm mclaren apparently squander the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film which make it that much more obnoxious the intention from the beginning be to create monument to the genius of mclaren who to this day take full credit for create punk music create the sex pistol and at time even write all the song viewer follow mclaren to various setting where he tell his story to his sidekick female dwarf and simply take credit for one thing after another one particularly irritating scene have mclaren in an abandon airplane hangar wait for plane be hound by reporter and give them their big story the most entertaining element of the film be the animated short piece however even these reek of mclaren overbear self importance even as farce this film doesn work little about it be entertain except for steve jones who be surprisingly decent as pseudo detective type person 20 year later julien temple who write and direct this film also direct the sex pistols documentary the filth and the fury while that movie be much good and more interesting than swindle it still be full of temple artistic flourish that just don work like interview band member in shadow as if they be some kind of crime witness try to hide their identity an interesting bit of trivia film critic roger ebert be one of the original scriptwriter for the movie who kill bambi which eventually become swindle
great character study and masterful actor showcase sidney lumet dog day afternoon be one of the most highly enjoyable and wildly funny movie ve ever see smart sharp complex witty and often quotable dialogue and superbly act al pacino star as sonny an optimistic loser who decide to hold up bank with his friend sal play by the late great john cazale to get money for his lover leon sex change operation the film be only work around few sequence and may seem overlong to some but it work excellently because it be hold together by the fantastic acting al pacino be astound as sonny and his work here even eclipse the excellent work he do as michael corleone in the godfather and that say something because adore that movie and his portrayal pacino have the facial tic and the energy and the wide eye optimism down pat and his performance be extremely engaging and entertaining take for example his scene where he rouse up the crowd against the police by chant attica attica put your ing gun down lesser actor would have make it insipid but pacino make it oddly poignant and hilarious at the same time and he be rob of his oscar for his role the late john cazale be also superb as sal the dopey eye follower the quiet laid back calm to pacino maniacal energy it a less flashy role but cazale still bring on all the laugh especially in his deadpan delivery of the line sonny they re say there be two homosexual in here m not homosexual frank pierson win an oscar for his script for reason the dialogue be hilarious sharp and witty many of the line in this movie be extremely quotable and you can check some of them out under memorable quote this be intelligent write in the sense that you will laugh and be move at the same time great movie it belong in your vhs or dvd collection 10 10
beg for remake this be very interesting idea for movie but here it be do in pretty hokey way with amateurish writing and some weak acting decent scriptwriter back up by serious talent in the acting and direct department could make an excellent movie of it there the sense of unravel mystery the young generation against the old the whiff of corruption in picture perfect town and climactic scene that the audience have be wait for all along wasn particularly surprise at the end here since it could have go in only one of two way but more creative approach could cap everything off in more interesting way
what disappointment be absolutely gutted about this really expect lot from this movie and get nothing in return truthfully if it wasn for brad pitt this movie would have be completely dull so the five star go to brad pitt and the ode to the swing 60s before it demise
worth my price of admission after see another excellent movie decide to do little illicit theatre hopping and move over to see force it be worth just what pay to get in would list the plot hole inanity and just plain stupid part but this review be limit to 1000 word however some of the more memorable sadly yes the funny scene be in the trailer why do the force team member still talk after their translator have be take what another sighting of the evil fbi guy flatulence enough already super secret lab in warehouse where have see that before unfortunately can give anything low than 1 star to this waste of time
long dull and confuse a confidential be one long dull confuse movie with small spark that quickly fade and burn out even stellar cast include kevin spacey and russell crowe cant get past the convoluted script that make so many twist and turn you will get headache the acting be good except for one person and that one person be kim basinger who for some unknown reason be give an oscar say give because her performance in this movie be not only terrible but it be one of the bad have ever see if you like good movie try something else if you like watch movie for three hour that bore you to tear and make you say thanks god that be over try this 3 out of 10 star
absolute masterpiece best movie ve watch in long time magnificent performance by the leading actor and even support role incredible set photography costume script direction you name it true chef oeuvre and feast for the sens cotillard be out of this world in almost every scene she appear in would not be surprise at all if she seal an oscar next year or at least nomination phoenix have an outstanding performance in this emotionally charge brilliantly write and direct movie about the very depths of human nature lust love greed survival good and evil renner be great too within the frame of his role with some unexpected event as the story unfolds this be not movie where you can predict exactly what will happen next you just sit back and live this amazing movie experience and thank god such great picture be still make couple of hour of my life very well spend
infinitely deep an experience will not forget insert all 9 amp 10 review here be in awe during the entire film lenny abrahamson amp the writing team make sure there be not one dull moment the addition of quot insignificant quot character and plot twist be later realize to be so significant and influential in keep the film alive throughout its duration it be the little thing that make this story one of the best 39 ve see in long time experience an entire palette of emotion all at once and be leave in deep level of curiosity and reflection very few film have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credit room be endless in the most beautiful way
wonderful animation mediocre storyline after pixar previous effort the incredibles may suffer by comparison yes the animation be wonderful and detailed but the storylne and script leave lot to be desire one big disappointment be that there be very few genuinely funny moment and it felt more like an animated action movie the storyline concern itself with individual be proud of their talent and that everyone should try to become the best at what they excel in this be wrap together with what be at best hackneyed spy or action movie storyline that be not go to win any prize for originality this be not bad film but by pixar standard be definitely not great one
at best poor emulation of sci fi grandeur it not great let me start off by say that don mean to be to use the go to and clichéd term on imdb hater m not despite cruise many personal fault still think he a terrific actor and he usually make great choice when it come to script this be not one of those understand there be countless review that already that discuss this film penchant for previous sci fi work and usually film that pay homage to other idea from before itself do so with reverence and with flair that bring something new this film do not this be the culmination of hollywood producer sit in room brainstorm previous successful innovative idea and try to compress them into one story that will garner the big box office return the visuals be impressive especially give the budget know that may seem like silly statement but most film nowadays on such scale will have budget twice as large as this film and yet still win achieve such beauty with cgi the hobbit for example so for this give oblivion high praise however the plot be pander and thoroughly un original and again the argument here seem to be all sci fi movie borrow from early work and theme yes this be true to an extent but what most seminal work of sci fi have in common be that they elaborate on these theme and they in turn offer something new this film do nothing it take what it could from previous concept smash them together into mess of plot and hop that young audience who wouldn be aware of its blatant plagiarism would marvel at its supposed uniqueness nothing about this film plot have merit inspiration have its us and it will nurture idea this be simply hack attempt to capitalise on previous work
morally ambiguous see the pianist movie really bother me partly because 10 year after schindler list it seem like so much less of movie it not groundbreaking the production quality isn good the lead man act with deer in headlight expression but be mostly bother by the anti hero szpilman he a selfish person concern only with his own survival other people give him lot of assistance not because he deserve it but because he talented be this good don know it seem good that the people of poland risk and sacrifice much to protect gifted musician through the holocaust but don find szpilman likable especially after read 1952 at the close of the movie just want to bop him in the nose what jerk it also bother me that hollywood or rather the academy seem to overreward piano play character look at the movie the pianist the piano shine you want to win an oscar play the piano
sick movie overrate by sick critic this movie be fairly entertaining but be overrate by film critic it also horrible example of m not kid here actually make child killer into sympathetic figure how sick be that no wonder the professional critic like this so much be the disturbed lot tend to be peter lorre who play the killer can be creepy guy but he isn as creepy as the critic would have you believe either the film however get point for be well make for its time period the movie be about 75 year old but really be not date too much which be amaze the camera work be excellent too with some interesting high and low angle and it a story that generally keep your interest what really turn me off be the last part critic particularly like this film because of the plea by the lawyer near the end to spare the man life that okay but they go overboard with that to the point of portray this madman as sympathetic figure liberal would have you more concerned about the killer than his victim sick
college amateur production about be jerk the moral of the la la land story be you can have your cake and it if you be jerk no wonder this film be so popular in hollywood where so many jerk abound who can feel reassure that their mess up life be fate not because of their own idiocy yes you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your life if you re not jerk about it and have contrive ego laden dinner conversation that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of 12 year old the very first sequence set the two protagonist up as couple of self absorb jerk and the final sequence pivot on what could have be if sebastian hadn be jerk from the outset but other than that the film have all the hesitant dance step plot transparency wooden act except emma stone off key singing and simplistic 2 chord tune drill into the ground of college amateur production
it sit in limbo for several year and be complete without some of the most important filmmaker nuff say accidental love be film which have huge production problem the filmmaker run out of money and the film sit for year and it be so famous for this that it be an entry in the book the great film you ll never see then after be auction off year later the film be complete though many of the folk who have be work on the project refuse to return to complete it as result you have movie that be at time bite incomprehensible and confuse again when you be try to salvage project this isn all that surprise what do find surprising be the review despite the weird way in which the film be complete it be at least in many part quite enjoyable but there be quite few reviewer that give it score of 1 and talk as if it the bad film ever make well it simply isn or even close to be the bad film so why do so many attack the movie perhaps it because the folk be angry about the film be in favor of national healthcare or the gay angle toss into the story completely out of the blue towards the latter part of the movie all know be that be guess that folk hat it so much because of the film message which doesn seem 100 fair on the other hand the film be at time so confusing and disjoint also couldn understand few review that give the movie 10s and 9s how could film that take almost decade to complete and without all the crew and actor get 9 or 10 both extreme seem unfair and the truth be somewhere in the middle the first 30 minute of the film part of which be add much later worked very well while you wouldn think have woman get nail shot into her head sound unfunny the whole thing be handle well and be funny it be only when the afflict woman go to washington dc that thing begin to become confusing and at time kind of dumb it all real shame as there really be germ of great idea for this film but after while it just seem to become incomprehensible and bizarre just for the sake of be bizarre mess but very interesting mess perhaps they should have just leave this one on the shelf though it be occasionally quite fun budget 26 000 000 estimate cumulative worldwide gross 24 487
a wartime romance that could have be epic but didn quite make it allied have garner mixed reaction on imdb and with critic in general this be completely understandable and the mixed reaction and the reasoning for it mirror my own feeling for the film ally be not bad film but from see the trailer which strongly suggest film that would be more epic more moving and more thrilling to be honest be expect lot more there be lot to like about ally visually it be gorgeous film the cinematography be rich in atmosphere and colour and be quite poetic too while the set scenery and costume be evocative and eye catch the music by alan silvestri be neither too intrusive or too low key instead stir when it need to be and understated again when need there be some thrilling and harrow moment as well as some poignant one in the more intimate scene personally think the controversial end be quite emotional but can definitely see why it win work for some marion cotillard give nuanced and deeply felt turn nothing short of sensational brad pitt performance have be criticise as well as defend to me it be appropriately stoic despite his character be nowhere near as meaty as cotillard and he be worthy partner for cotillard little cold in place but mostly fiery the support cast be fine on the other hand the script and pacing be uneven the script be ally big flaw lack plausibility in place especially in the mission scene have too much padding that overlong and add little to nothing and some of the part intend to be emotional laid it on too thick with the treacle and sentimentality much more could have be do with the psychological subtext which would have make pitt character more interesting and give the story more consistent suspense and thrill pace do drag badly frequently primarily due to have superfluous scene that lack momentum and go on too long and also due to robert zemeckis quite disappointing direction there be moment but it be case of get the job do but in workmanlike and tame fashion not the thrill and cleverness one expect from zemeckis that be present in the best of his work in summary have potential to be epic as wartime romance but doesn quite make it many great thing but few big thing that get in the way of fulfil full potential
darkly poetic look hypocritical message the film make incredible use of interior and location and fashion and style combine with the minimal acting style pretty standard for these kind of film melville le samourai for example the setting seem to poetically express what in jack carter soul end in stun finale it a wonderfully cold film capture the revenge mood perfectly where the film lose me be in its seemingly unconscious double standard it develop theme of female innocence corrupt that one perfect tear with carter smile warmly at girl and her mother on the boat on the other hand the film be grossly exploitive of its actress revel in phone sex and seduction dig the rock chair scene the sex be ok and seem dare for its time but the puritannical streak try to get it both way think the limey which obviously owe debt to this film be much good at portray an agent of vengeance discover his own responsibility in the mess he try so hard to be coldly superior to have see croupier recently feel like hodges be greatly talented but have something crucial missing
it just bad and not in good way go expect it to be bad but sometimes bad can be entertain this be just bad there be no entertainment value in its badness it like the cinematic equivalent of the tide pod challenge many in the theater could not take it and leave those of us who stay only succeed in poison themselves not much of an accomplishment find myself angry angry at the people who make it angry at the people who distribute it it be an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment

best friend comedy like that be tough to master balance the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside and while wouldn say that both character really redeem themselves wholly it give them nice touch touch that include quite lot of non pc behavior be alert and do not watch if you be sensible to that sort of thing it be french comedy with heart and it be sleeper hit in germany word of mouth make this big success bit of credit have to go to the people who dub it guess watch the original version with subtitle because they must have do phenomenal job it be not perfect but that fact make it even weirder and more adorable
battle royale without the stinger the hunger game be an instant hit when it come out so m pretty sure m the last person in this universe to see it unfortunately it sorta felt like be waste my time the movie seem like equal part run man the truman show and battle royale but with all the clever element from either of those movie remove don get kick out of gratuitous violence or something but spend the first hour on build up that will barely have any effect on the plot be looooooooong take for example all the scene where they have to impress possible sponsor to provide outside help with their fighting skill sponsor come into play so rarely later on that all those scene be completely cuttable during the actual hunger game battle royale you still don get much of an action or adventure movie they re after pull heart string mostly include the incredibly stretch out death scene of character we literally know nothing about full action free hour wasn enough to establish some trait the most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything be our main cardboard cutout grant jennifer lawrence do the best she can with the material be up against highly trained manhunters heavily bleed and leave trace all over the forest how do they not die on the first day how do nobody spot them when they stand there cry and scream in wide open space some other character light small fire and be kill within about three second but guess you can act stupid if you re not important to the plot the main character don survive because they re so strong so creative so quick or so fearless they survive because the script say so therefor there barely any tension you can predict everything beat for beat give its massive success this movie get to have lot of appeal but it must have miss me by mile

less horror and more supernatural drama about love throughout the age after the huge success of frankenstein and dracula the previous year universal studio expand their repertoire of movie monster by capitalize on the aura of egyptian mystery still fresh in the popular consciousness from the discovery of tutankhamen along with all the attendant curse only ten year before what more fresh from his iconic role as the monster in frankenstein boris karloff be perfectly cast as the resurrected mummy of the title imhotep who like the monster loom large and star menacingly as the ostensible villain but also convey an essential humanity which by the end invoke more sympathy than fear and strike surprisingly poignant note by the time the credit roll the story begin in 1921 when an ancient scroll the scroll of thoth be unearthed and read by an over enthusiastic archaeologist which inadvertently resurrect the mummy imhotep who promptly disappear send the archaeologist mad he reappear decade later go under the name ardath bay loom enigmatic figure who walk among the living and aide in another archaeological so that he may pursue the reincarnated soul of the woman he love over 3000 year before and employ magic to destroy anyone who hinder his obsessive aim as be common with film from this era the film be slow paced and be low on explicit scare by modern standard but first time director karl freund previously cinematographer on number of german expressionist film such as fritz lang 1927 classic metropolis as well as universal own dracula effortlessly crafts suspenseful atmosphere which remain grip throughout as imhotep motivation and fatal flaw be reveal the cast be uniformly excellent obviously karloff with the help of make up job from jack pierce who also transform karloff into frankenstein monster own the feature despite relatively little screen time but the rest of the cast flesh out the drama brilliantly all in all the mummy be remarkable film which will probably confound many expectation of what it will be like from the slew of pop culture reference most people will have accumulate regard the theme know be however even though it may be different film to what most would expect there be no deny the great movie that it be
good but also boring great acting very good cinematography and we all know that scorsese be amazing director but the movie be very long and feel very long lot of great movie be very long and they be great like lawrence of arabia and schindler list for example they be classic and in my opinion the irishman be not go to enter in this category also the de age cgi be not convincing and why put those contact lens in de niro eye when scorsese make the aviator he didn put contact lens on dicaprio in casino de niro didn look anything like the character he be play it be unnecessary probably netflix fault the most positive point of the film be joe pesci performance he be very contained but can also show that he be very dangerous person very different than the role he play in others scorsese film which be also great and some other movie he star during his career look like we never go to have great movie with de niro and pacino play two real old guy with lot of screen time together and m not say that lot of screen time together be necessarily well for example in righteous kill they also have lot screen time but that movie be bad in heat they have only one scene together two if you count their confront in the end but that famous scene in heat be extremely well write act and with perfect timing but this be for another review
the return of the queen that film as good as cleopatra be be create at all under the madness and panic of it legendary production be indeed an amazing feat that cleopatra have be give such love care in its restoration in this dvd of the road show print and the attendant bonus material be wondrous gift to those who love this film the documentary cleopatra the film that change hollywood be in on it own an engrossing and informative two hour movie for anyone who know little of the history of cleopatra or who be not around at the time this documentary will give them the feeling of what those last day of old hollywood be like and therein one can find the reason why this intimate epic be indeed the wonder that it be many thanks should go to the mankiewicz family and the producer of the documentary the print and the sound of cleopatra seem now to surpass what recall it to be in its first presentation nearly forty year ago the depth of the color and the richness of the shadow be indeed splendid in this restoration it be hard to believe this film be as old as it be the commentary track be in and of itself like find the lost treasure of the long dead monarch for there be wonderful recollection by martin landau tom and chris mankiewicz and even the one of the film publicists jack brodsky get to read section from his book the cleopatra paper which give blow by blow description of everyday event on the set but must give special mention to landau part with his keen eye for the art direction of john decuir one see thing in the background and along the edge of the scene that one never notice before such lovingly detailed set and interior will never be see again the cost today be just too prohibitive also his insight into what be cut from the film particularly his and richard burton contribution in the second act give one the idea of what mankiewicz be intend poor richard suffer the unkind cut of all the presentation of the dvd menu be so clever and exotic the creator of this dvd be to be commend in their art direction at last we now know what be behind the massive 20th century fox logo the film itself remain what it have always be it be good film that might have be great one if only zanuck have trust joe mankiewicz original vision it be say that they be still look for the missing film one can only hope that they succeed in this task the performance range from good to excellent particular praise must go to rex harrison richard burton martin landau robert stephens andrew keir and roddy mcdowall lastly in this department there remain elizabeth taylor performance as cleopatra at the film release the brickbat be reserve for her and for reason that have nothing to do with her performance many review her behavior as see through the narrow focus of the tabloid and emerge paparazzo even today it be sometimes hard to separate the history of the lady from her film role but here be the moment in time in this film where she become the elizabeth taylor she have remain in the mind of the world ever since in this fact alone she be perfect in the role but she be more than that as cleopatra she be at once regal and command strong and tender soft and hard these be all the contradiction that have always be at the heart of cleopatra herself she and the queen be master of public enigma wrap within mystery in her performance as write by mankiewicz elizabeth taylor be probably not too far off from the historical cleopatra finally ever since judith crist give cleopatra the needle in 1963 and in the act make her name the public for the most part have view this film failure but today strip of the scandal hype and hysteria of its release in june of 1963 it be now possible to view cleoparta as the film it be near great film that be the signpost of when hollywood pass from one age into another historically this be an important dvd and recommend it highly cleopatra remains as seductive beautiful and intelligent as it be in walter wanger original conception age can not wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety

bore stupid cliché punchline thrower this be where imdb need to react to all those obviously faked review if they don people will just ignore all blockbuster review which would call for competition that will take action against this kind of manipulation this have never be so obvious than with the avenger this movie do not deserve rating above 4 the plot be uninspired and boring have no twist and everyone know where it go the dialog feel very scripted character in comic book for 5 year old maybe talk like that superheroes don the acting be very unnatural it feel very staged and no emotion be be transport to the audience the character aren develop they just get different punchlines to throw at the audience the cgi be really bad not worthy of movie of 2012 think even 2001 space odyssey 1968 have well special effect it seem that they spend almost all their money on the actor forget about the story and just use the cheap cgi they could get the rest of the money they use for marketing and create hype as say this be obvious here on imdb the whole thing be just cheap but we will see more of this if people continue to make this kind of movie profitable and this will probably be the case so expect more of these
in comparison to cartoon and character eh it be alright when you go into movie base on cartoon or video game you be already at viewer own risk there be lot of negative review on this so will try to shine little light on some positive thing first start off the graphic be great and like how the introduction start off like the animated series ve watch all the season of avatar with my wife and two girl so it be refresh to see it start off like the cartoon appa the air bison look great and the graphic for the different nation attack look pretty good my only complaint on those action sequence be the slow pace aang move be to complicate he twirl his staff way too much to perform one basic attack in the cartoon aang could preform move easily and lightly by barely move the attack be all really slow and only start to pick up in the end and the fire nation act like zuko uncle be the only one who could make fire straight from his hand they all have to use fire in their surrounding area to do anything move on to the act they all act out of character katara do okay and zuko be almost on point ll even give little credit to zuko uncle who at least sound like the character from the series but everyone else be stiff hated sokka with emphasis he be to big and bulky and his acting be stiff and bore he barely ever joke and take everything to serious he seem like someone out of military movie topher grace could have do well job he need to be skinny and funny to pull off that character both of which he be not now aang aang do okay but he be way to serious too the aang know be lighthearted and childlike do lot of thing spontaneously and act on emotion this aang do not while he do show some emotion for the loss of his fellow people he clearly fail to personify the innocence of the character even the appa and momo barely act like themselves the most entertaining thing appa do be let some child play with him in the beginning that be about it you couldn even tell aang and appa have close relationship and momo do not show his curiosity enough but he be cute and appa be beautifully animate zuko do great job the only thing be he be play the role little more confused and whiny than angry would like to have see him little more passionate about his anger and the burn scar on his face could have be good and cover little more area look more like he have be punch then burnt now m not try to pull race card because m asian american but think they could have at least looked little like their character little bit less white and slightly more islander or asian sokka and katara look nothing like the series they be way to pale skinned aang look okay he be very light skin anyway the fire nation be the only people who look the part the plot pretty much stick to the series which do like lot it take lot from the episode and put it into the movie overall love the series so would still get the movie when it come out but if your child like just the idea of avatar be movie and disregard the way the character act then would say give it fair chance it be still pretty good movie s just to note the most annoying thing about this movie be the way the mispronounced aang avatar and sokka it irritate me the whole movie almost as much as sokka act

exceeds expectation fresh take on spiderman that leave you want more the fight scene be incredible and the animation style be use to the movie advantage visually very stunning and although there be thing in the movie that be rather underdeveloped g prowler overall it didn detract from all the good that the movie brings
pinkfloydthemusicorthemovie really they could have show any picture movie cartoon or anything else with this excellent sound track and fab song it would be worth watch and listen to its all quite grim and bleak but then thats what lot of pink floyd song be like think the song and movie of early decade be much good than the rubbish in the chart at the moment and pink floyd be perfect example of this fact my favourite song from the wall be comfortably numb this be also my favourite pink floyd song from any album the first time watch the cartoon that come with pink floyd song be only about 6 or 7 year old and they hypnotise me then and they still hypnotise me now although for different reason by the way the other group that really like and be huge fan of be queen
best new cartoon show 2013 the show feel fidgety in the beginning at first it make you take second to get use and into it but it 39 as intelligent and hilarious show as haven 39 see one since long time that 39 what and hopeful many other viewer be go to realize after couple of minute it 39 one of those show that wouldn 39 happen to be without adult swim not exactly family show anyways this show be brilliant the humor be not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoon and the show be not as comfortable to watch but that 39 one thing that make it so hilarious it 39 really dark sometimes and the viewer with good sense of humor will appreciate that the only thing that might make the show bit well be that the creator could make the character bite good know and thus more likable to the viewer like this plot as in episode 6 se1 would work even well well the character maybe bit flat still but the plot and happening be make all this acceptable amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for 20min cartoon show the sad part be that it might not really be for the rank and file and as result might not last for too long or even be recognize by too many people really hope this go on for while though love this show it 39 great keep up the good work br br p hope they take one or two scientist on board to help them with grandpa rick to keep him on track regard scientific accuracy but that 39 just personnel tic of mine
disappointed just too slow for me there be some interesting scene that couldn overcome the pace
i be not able to fully appreciate it it be silent film make in the 20s world vastly different from mine and can not see how could possible understand the political going on in germany at that time or even the social going on how can say this film be bad or good all do know be that as 18 year old british kid do not enjoy the film and be thankful when it be over for such an old film just couldn appreciate it do however think that the cinematography be obviously fantastic and very creative for the time the film be make second point would make be do not believe silent film can be rat in the same way that the film now can be they be so different and compare them be ridiculous so watch this film for the historical context at least and if you do enjoy it then that a bonus
white people be the enemy will see the show to the end just for continuity sake also holy cow can they smack us around with the anti american sentiment any more m start to feel like the writer have the true enemy as not zemo not discount captain america not the flagsmashers but all white people be the enemy m ok with an underlying theme of that kind of stuff but the last few episode just keep punch me right the face with it don care if you be leave or right just want to keep politics out of entertainment the acting be ok feel like they really nerfed bucky anyone remember how bad he be in the winter soldier and discount captain america like what they be do with him he play rage monster pretty well five episode in be hop wouldn be expose to bucky and sam fix boat for 30 minute pretty average series especially when it stand next to wandavision
a very overrated movie why have this garner 13 oscar nomination to call the curious case of benjamin button masterpiece as some people have be do have get to be the big misnomer of this year whilst it an ok movie it by no mean the masterpiece many be purport it to be really do take issue with people spuriously call movie of today masterpiece especially when such an adjective be unwarranted so let just say that this be masterpiece be we to believe that it on par with the like of citizen kane go with the wind or even the godfather all of which would deem to be masterpiece think not the reality be that it doesn even come close to any of the aforementioned movie not to mention myriad of others that could mention the story centre around boy who be bear under unusual circumstance in that he be bear an old man and as consequence age in reverse thus become young his father leave him on the step of nursing home have discover that his wife who have die during child birth have give birth to an abnormal child black woman who work at the nursing home adopt him as her own and the story of benjamin button take flight don know if it be just me but couldn believe the lack of dismay and consternation at how the child be initially receive by the resident of the nursing home one lady comment that he look like my ex husband whilst others look at the baby as if they be show newspaper find this particular scene highly implausible because in reality most people would have run mile have be show something so hideous and out of the ordinary have to say whilst think that cate blanchett give good performance as always find brad pitt performance extremely pedestrian and lack gravitas prove yet again why he ll always be movie star and never bona fide actor feel an actor such as johnny depp or robert downey jr would have add more weight and natural act ability to the role but then they be far superior actor although mr pitt have be nominate for an oscar he be go to have mountain to climb if he to win this accolade as the performance from frank lagella frost nixon sean penn milk and mickey rourke the wrestler be far superior this be not bad movie but be expect something far well consider the acute adulation that this movie have be receive as for the best picture nomination think that slumdog millionaire should win as it be far more compelling and care about the character lot more think it be far superior and unpretentious picture whereas benjamin button be movie that scream give me an oscar as oppose to actually deserve one
throw together look like they throw the movie together absolutely awful actually it look like it be suppose to be spoof the book be much good than this crap
a milestone in cinematography love this movie this film be milestone in cinematography great immersive camera work this film be an experience and have already see it 4 time and only see more quality of the film
hugely overrate despise the term overrate partly because of its often use on imdb but this movie be the dictionary definition of the term how do it win those oscar why it be in the top 250 don know polanski tribute to the holocaust be largely pedestrian affair that suffer from lack of style and tautness the inclusion of many scene in the movie be mysterious consider the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the brody character story the film therefore feel bloat and self important polanski do not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style and just show us what happen before casually stroll onto the next scene polanski would argue that this be because the subject matter do not need any style or opinion add to it which be fair enough however the problem with this be that it be extremely dull for the audience the powerful element of the movie be few and far between bluntening their impact also towards the middle of the film there seem to be genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treat to lot of long shot contrast with close ups what this be suppose to tell us be also mystery while the movie must be commend for its treatment of the subject matter and adrien brody excellent performance it feel more guided rather than direct its casual attitude to the violence seem mundane rather than shock and there be nothing here that steven spielberg didn do good in schindler list essentially dull rather than powerful only the last 45 minute make this film memorable 6 10
what swelegant elegant movie this be mgm be pretty lucky to secure the talent of bing crosby frank sinatra grace kelly celeste holm and louis armstrong to get involve in this great musical adaption of the philadelphia story cole porter contribute great original score for this film with song very specifically write to suit the talent of high society player do wish celeste holm have be give more to do than just the duet with frank sinatra who want to be millionaire on broadway celeste holm be musical star with oklahoma and bloomer girl to her credit but mgm didn want to recognize that for this film the story be reset from philadelphia to newport rhode island to bring in the famous jazz festival philip barry social commentary be tone down and very partisan greek chorus be add in the person of mr louis satchmo armstrong satchmo tell you right up front who he pull for to win grace kelly and he help musically along the way satch and bing have that classic now you have jazz duet so successful be it that they do an album together few year later bing crosby during his life be crazy about jazz musician and there be no one he like good than louis armstrong no one on the planet could resist that man joy for live grace kelly get chance to bat 1000 in the recording industry she be no singer as she would have freely admit but cole porter write true love specifically to accommodate her limited range and when she do the last two bar of true love with der bingle she get million selling record for her one and only platter as for bing he get his 20th gold record and the only one not with decca record true love be nominate for best song at the oscar but lose to doris day que serum serum which boom all over the chart in 1956 it be sadly cole porter last opportunity to win an oscar for one of his movie song frank sinatra get couple of good ballad in you re sensational and mind if make love to you but what he best remember for be that classic well do you evah duet with bing today fan can possibly appreciate the screen meeting of the two best and best know singer for the previous generation musical summit conference high society tone be lot light than the philadelphia story the cast in term of act ability be not in the same league as grant stewart hepburn and hussey but folk it be musical doubt those star could have carry off the cole porter score you can miss with cast like this in either film for that matter
a blooming wonderful garden state garden state come out in the uk on december 10th have hear wonderful thing about it from friend and relative in the us wasn disappoint from start to finish the film make me laugh and cry think the opening in which we meet braff lie emotionless in bed listening to the answer machine message from his dad about his mother death be disturb and really draw me in so many memorable moment the funeral touching and funny the party scenes the scan scene and as for the dialogue well sharp and witty don think will ever forget natalie portman dance in her bedroom just to be unique or zach braff touch comment about what make home in the swimming pool even those touching moment be funny the fact that he couldn swim as mid twenty something this film really speak to me it that question we all dread we ve graduated university get job then what fantastic just shame it be not on wide release here one of the best film have see in age 9 10
austen would approve the zombie over this movie this movie be guilty of murder jane austen wit and charm not to mention historic accuracy and cleanliness it be more reminiscent of the misery and filth depict in dickens or hardy victorian era rather that austen regency period could almost smell the pig stench off of their greasy hair and dirty clothes this have nothing do with austen world of pomp and circumstance it be so very obvious that no one involve with this movie have even read austen adore dame judy but she should have walk off this set the character mumble and spit out their dialogue like modern day teen at the burger king takeout window the witty and clever vixen miss eliza bennet have be turn into an unkempt angry and out of control mess the house be dilapidate and run down more in keep with fanny price ramshackle hovel from mansfield park not longbourn but perhaps the big travesty of all be the way this movie have crush and humiliate one of the cleverest and most sardonic of character in literature by portray mr bennet as snivel downtrodden hen peck half wit even the one scene that could have have any redeeming quality namely mr darcy cut handsome figure walk half dress through the misty field in slow motion be blatant and shameless rip off from no other than colin firth epic wet shirt moment in the fabulous and exquisite 1995 version must see so the only reason this movie should even exist be to expose whole generation who would never read any of austen book to an imbecile attempt at cliff note version of magnificent masterpiece

do you still wish you could turn back the clock the curious case of benjamin button be near epic film in almost the same way forrest gump be be not particularly fan of david fincher and his work yet strongly admire the curious case of benjamin button this film be about man name benjamin button who lead much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstance the one thing that separate him from any other human be be that he age backwards despite such large difference between the audience and benjamin button the film find way to connect with large variety of people in way that do not seem to happen so often the acting be very good throughout the movie especially that of cate blanchett who seem to be turn out one great performance after another she play the role of daisy benjamin button real love interest from start to finish in fact she play so well it might have be partial downfall to the movie her performance out shin that of the main character play by brad pitt although pitt be very solid in his performance do not believe he deserve an oscar nomination rather blanchett deserve one for his role of play benjamin button he be not necessity to the movie and do not add much to it he be not bad but he wasn spectacular throughout though many of the different actor and actress light up the screen especially tilda swinton who be wonderful to watch as button short live love interest her presence be magical and joy to watch would have love to see just little bit more of her character the directing of david fincher in the curious case of benjamin button be of what believe to be his best work to date the screenplay of eric roth be write very well as he have have experience with these type of movie in many scene the dialog and great direction combine for some epic scene ultimately enjoy this movie very much but something felt miss from the movie something seem left unsaid that be vital felt that the great downfall to this movie be that brad pitt didn give an amazing performance and do not take control of the movie rather blanchett steal the show from him which make button seem less important to me despite that though it this film be do very well and would recommend it to all its an important story that make us self reflect and think deeply it display how we need to live with our mistake because they be part of our life we need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder what if
dishonest hollywood fluff due to popular demand some of the reason why lord of the ring be poor film this movie be so stifle by nonsense and hollywood trick that it hard to discern beneath it the work of purportedly intelligent talented and celebrate author beneath it to begin with there be way too many closeup in this movie why couldn peter jackson simply let us stand back and watch the character behave why do the camera have to keep poke into the character face look for subtle clue maybe jackson be spend too much time watch the moronic trash of spielberg the most overrated director of all time who still hasn learn how to let go of the audience hand the melodramatic soundtrack far from sustain or assist the story cheapen it and as spielberg be so adept at do lead me to believe that the intended audience be probably those people who don like to think too hard this film would ve be far improve if jackson have simply leave out the lousy soundtrack the special effect generally do not add anything to the story and there be plenty of plain illogical nonsense in here for one example think we can all agree that it physically impossible for human be to outrun an absolutely normal healthy horse if person be be follow at full gallop by horse the horse will always catch up also always have trouble swallow scene wherein one or two people capably defeat an army of assailant count ten twenty or more unless these one or two hero or heroine happen to have superhuman trait or at least an extraordinarily exceptional degree of train m not aware of whether or not this sort of occurrence be consistent with the actual text but as watch the film can help feeling lose in all of jackson nonsense and so much swooping why so much swoop more spielberg influence admit there also swoop in heavenly creature but by now his swooping have become quite distracting why can we just watch the character isn jackson suppose to be tell us story like jackson earlier film and heavenly creature be brilliant and compel one and clearly his best but now he off remake king kong maybe he get lose in hollywood someone please help him find his way out peter jackson have the potential of make great film which could ve last many decade as classic but instead he make sloppy moneymaker what loss but then again perhaps this movie be make for child on the plus side the pretty new zealand landscape be nice to look at
hope not the final girl trope be so play out we know who go to not be next early on duh cop shoot her and she still live the twist be suppose to be shock but be elementary so be the act elementary such sucky movie
no no gadget use to have fascination with the cartoon back in college when it be be make it have much the charm of get smart while it admittedly have its fault it be rather enjoyable naturally be very interested in see the film version that be before saw it afterwords wish it have never be make besides be miscast all around who on earth though broderick be even close to the role it just didn make the grade the effect be reasonable and perhaps the only thing like about the movie see live action version of the gadget in action what be miss be story and treatment which make it funny or charm or interest the original be wacky cartoon with very lighthearted attitude it be fun the motion picture become murky and take itself far too seriously if it have seriously have great plot or go crazy enough to make it seem like cartoon on film it might have be enjoyable as it exist it doesn deserve to be consider part of the gadget legacy
not the bad movie ever but just finish watch this from download live in china uk bear though and dvds here only cost 1 or 50p for the brit out there could have pick this one up but download it because have travel plan and want something on my mp4 player it be 1 well save read some of the review here one of which be write by someone who think this be an ironic side swipe at the slasher gore genre sorry but it wasn it pretty clear that this movie be make in all seriousness and be intend to be gory thriller with twist end will happily concede that the twist be interesting enough and not one suspect but the rest of the movie be just not good lohan do good job as dakota than she do as aubrey but she doesn have much to work with in term of character or script as most others here have say the killer identity be clear almost from the get go the blue motif be insanely heavy hand julia ormond and where have see him before be both accomplished actor with good reputation and really don know what they be do here maybe the producer spend the writer budget get these actor on board but in all fairness this really isn the bad movie ever make it be pretty bad and little disgusting in part poorly script lacking direction and only adequately acted think it might appeal to someone around 14 or 15 who want to be gross out and maybe little scared but to be honest think that 14 and 15 year old be more discerning anyway my advice would be to leave this one alone it fail to deliver on so many level
no no noah ve be an imdb lurker for several year and this film be so poor that felt motivate to write my first ever review it bad on so many level m not even quite sure where to begin storyline this film probably represent the big rick roll ve ever see naturally when people see film about great flood title noah the automatic assumption be that it a re telling of the biblical story this film cynically exploit that expectation and then drop hammer on the bewildered audience believe most people who watch this film will recognise that something be deeply wrong in it portrayal but they re less likely to realise that the fundamental reason be because the director have flood pun intend his movie with imagery and reference base not in christian theology but gnostic mysticism m not christian so wasn offend by this perspective on theological level but that didn lessen my disappointment on cinematic level at all special effect wow just wow the effect in this film wouldn look out of place in jason and the argonaut or the golden voyage of sinbad if you re not familiar with either of these much good movie it possibly because you weren bear when they be produce way back in the 60 and 70 in any case it sadden me to know that in 2014 effect of this standard be deem acceptable for general release but as soon as finish this review ll be dust off my magnavox for quick game of wipeout just to complete the sensation of time travel act this film sport strong cast with some of my favourite actor and most of them discharge their duty as well as might be expect give the script they re stick with do feel there be some overact with some of the more emotionally loaded scene but overall m more disappointed with the cast for accept their role than how they actually play them conclusion dear reader implore you go for walk read book call that friend you haven catch up with for age do anything but watch this film didn pay to watch this mockery but still feel cheated my oh sleep through most of it and feel jealous if you avoid it altogether after read this and other review then can at least feel like ve do my good deed for the day
an evangelical movie it bring back memory attend such camp in my youth the conflict be identifiable it be quite realistic but too obviously preachy the acting be creditable it be acceptable and watchable
why didn like la la land few day ago my friend show me la la land they love it and rave about how amazing and beautiful it be and get mad at me when say didn really care for it why be there such hype about this film don understand why it get nominate for so many award just didn like it the beginning start out like any other musical huge catchy dance number we meet mia an aspire actress and sebastian wannabe jazz musician both aren succeed with their dream they keep bump into each other and eventually fall in love but mia break it off when sebastian seem to be give up on his dream he get to her take her to one last audition and she make it as huge actress they don stay together at the end mia and her husband go to jazz cafe she see sebastian and there a montage of what their relationship could ve be love the music and love the costume that about it the movie be center around jazz which be historically from an african american background yet sebastian who absolutely love jazz be white and so be mia think it would ve be lot well with more diverse cast to me the first part didn match the second the first part be like regular musical except emma stone can sing but the second part try really hard to be an artistic abstract unique film those two part didn mesh together at all be this meant to be artistic or big musical when mention to my friend that emma stone cant sing they say that that the point that it mean to feel realistic yet the singing audio of her be obviously insert from studio if it mean to be realistic why didn they sing live also why be none of the main song in the musical jazz song if it mean to be center around jazz do like that mia and sebastian didn end up together however think it could ve be do so much good with small cast small budget live singing and diverse cast overall think la la land wasn too horrible but it definitely wasn great don understand how movie can be beautiful with such mismatched style wouldn watch it again but do listen to the soundtrack
if you enjoy the book you ll find it impossible to enjoy this film know once complete this book few month ago that there be no way this movie could possibly be long enough to portray the wonderful story that seth grahame smith put together but be hopeful that it would at least contain some of the best scene from the novel it do not in fact outside of the title few of the character this be not the same story at all even if you be to ignore the fact that this be such poor adaptation m not sure how so many people have give this movie positive review add the many clichés to the sometimes very poor act the very rushed pace of the story you get movie that far from worth the price of admission it such shame really this movie be just reminder that outside of k rowling not many author get the pleasure of see their word paint even half as beautifully on the big screen as they be on those thin piece of paper
nothing great but watchable while the first zero film be really something new in the lithuanian film industry the second film in the series do not feel all that fresh to be honest expect that this film would keep the good thing about the first film and add something deep some philosophical point or moral what saw be the plot which follow the same formula as the first film and do not seek to invent something add some bad act some unanswered question which consider to be plot hole what happen to the asian guy where do he ever come from do max buy implant for his wife do the bos ever find out what really happen even some mistake which be clearly not intend in spelling and what you get be what you could expect from movie create and shoot in several month it feel rush unfinished and kinda cheap which surprisingly be not so much felt in the first film the advertisement in the film be plentiful but hey you have to get the money from somewhere and although can immediately name 5 company which advertise themselves in this film the ad be more in place than in the first feature and spoil the fun much less this one really leave you with feel that another sequel in on the way do we need one hope that this band of filmmaker be capable of take new topic and maybe even address some eternal question which arise in good film there be no such moment when you start to wonder be the film be watch really about what see like in pulp fiction when the mysterious case be open clearly the film be inspire by tarantino and ritchie but they do not continue make gangster film forever hope this will also be the case here would love to see this company make history film or adaptation of book as tarantino and ritchie do the good thing lithuanian cinema be so bad that thing like swear in the film and non linear plot be still novelty here these thing be really well use and measure the joke be mostly not funny but the whole situation be fun to watch there be some potential for this film crew therefore have to give 7 for this film for its possible legacy in the future
my backlash vote say this be the 2 movie of all time be like say mcdonald make the best hamburger they re both palatable predictable inoffensive product that be easy to digest both have happy ending that be if you find the stunning speed with which mcdonald hamburger flush out your digestive tract to be happy occasion all you need to know be that shawshank have the exact same end as trading place so why not make trading place the great comedy of all time what the hell why not make it 3 on imdb it too be competent and utterly middle of the road in term of quality and originality within its genre instead of dan ackroyd and eddie murphy laugh it up on caribbean beach after best the force of evil we get morgan freeman and tim robbins it the exact same end shawshank be ok when saw it when it come out but count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6 7 rating that it deserve thusly hereby cast my symbolic 1 star vote 1

bring toy to real life not m no gi joe guru or fanatic and never have any of the toy but have to say be look forward to this movie without ever expect it to be anything special after see gi joe have to describe it as little bit disappointing and seemingly pointless other than perhaps as money spinner the film be watchable for the most part but devoid of any real emotion or suspense and not without try take child action figure and make real life film out of it might be good idea but still present those character on screen as two dimensional toy devoid of any real depth or character should not have have be and probably wasn the idea the film contain so much cgi and animation that watch it wonder why they hadn just do the whole thing in computer animation include the character it yet another example of film and possibly director who doesn seem to understand how so much more of something too much in fact can really add up to less at the finish line it full of action action and more action but on such scope and scale as to overdo it it be concentrate on the fantastical and illogical include the technology to the point of absurdity in place and as result it lack many of the other thing it require to really make the grade it not short of inspiration from few other movie scene either and more than once be remind of see very similar scene in different movie this project have plenty of merit but must suggest it end up in the hand of the wrong guy will say that my boy love it and give it 10 10 so it will undoubtedly appeal to much young audience young than it rating suggest kid movie but with plenty of violence wouldn tell anyone to avoid it at all cost but if you happen to miss it you ve not miss whole lot shame really

horrible don watch the simpson in its prime be perhaps the best show on tv with incisive satire on american life and humor that didn rely solely on slapstick and stupidity around season 9 the show go precipitously downhill and never recover the show although always cartoon be now as infantile and ridiculous as cartoon be perceive to be the simpson movie be like an 18th season episode stretch out 3x as long there be few funny joke but it become painful and tiresome to sit thru dozen of missed joke to get to funny one the plot be inane concern giant dome put on springfield to hold in the pollution and the government want to blow up the city to get rid of it what make the simpson great be its more subtle satire and it at least tried to stay ground within reality the show be like parody of itself the same kind of stupid sitcom it once make fun of replace alf clausen usual score with han zimmer be also terrible misfire the straightforward orchestral treatment for the show be very distract it a shame this movie and this show continue to make fortune no one ever go break cater to the low common denominator this movie will appeal to the same demographic that love ace ventura and the ernest movie and will undoubtedly spawn sequel it just anger me that troy mcclure wasn joking in an old episode when he say the simpson will continue to be around until they be unprofitable
insufferable but hilarious there be some terrible acting moment from cage and connery here that be as entertaining as strong brando moment so the terrible script can be ignore for the entertainment value the direction suck the acting be bad but it worth watch for those who love schlock fun drinking game be to take shot every time there a cringe you ll be drink in 20 minute
very thought provoke find it sad that so many people have give this movie such negative review think this movie be very underrated maybe its just because angelina jolie direct it and not some hot shot like steven spielberg or something maybe people have vendetta towards angelina or something or maybe people be peeve because it doesn tell the story of the bosnian war in realistic way but think the movie be very well do the actor be superb and the story although not completely true be very thought provoke it give you sense of what it be like found it very sad and tragic think that all angelina be try to do be to give you sense of what it be like she never say it be go to be documentary or anything think for her first time direct she didn do bad job this movie isn perfect but its not bad either think people just need to get over there issue the whole brad and jen thing be so last decade ago get over it already
i really love this movie and don understand the crappy rating i watch this on amazon prime expect nothing put it on the background while be do work but then end up watch it instead of do my work think the actor be natural and the story be sweet it really about friendship and about kid try to find their power to do thing think it have several important message perhaps kid wouldn understand this movie fully until they grow up m 44 and think it be perfect movie for sunday afternoon and the alien be supercute
mediocre film that never quite catch true essence of comic full disclosure have indeed read the graphic novel and love it it really make you think about the true nature of humankind and make you ponder the true breadth of the moral scale while be subtle and clever parody of superhero comic while still show an obvious respect for them yes fanboys do treat it like an infallible masterpiece of religious stature don agree with that but it be still most definitely thought provoke read that will stick with you for age the movie adaptation on the other hand um well at least the cinematography be nice zack snyder definitely get the look of the book right and it manage to perfectly capture that cold war tension and hostility but everything else just seem to fall flat have high hope for this movie base on fan review but really think their bias and knowledge of these character cloud their judgment the only character can say be properly develop here compare to the novel be rorschach in an excellent performance by haley but his presence just seem pushed aside to make room for silk spectre and dreiberg in some terribly lazy at best performance by akerman and wilson the comedian be good although wish snyder actually adhere more closely to the book in that regard and use him more sparingly dr manhattan be pretty much what expect but his monotone diatribe come off as less godlike and more just plain creepy veidt role be more amped up here and the actor just do not capture the character ambiguity at all definitely feel like someone who be go into this blind could tell immediately that something more sinister be behind him the first ten minute be the most stunning they actually do manage to perfectly capture the exposition of the novel and the historical context behind it but all in all watchman just can capture the complexity of the original the character be flat the symbolism be go and we re stick with plod storyline that just leave you bore more than anything pros contrary to popular opinion actually do like the cgi in this film rorschach be perfect the comedian be also pretty good con silk spectre be probably one of the bad actress ve ever see excessive runtime the action the dialogue the pace somehow literally almost everything seem to appear flat here conclusion yes watchman look almost exactly like the comic but it lack the literary element that make it such compelling story
not sure why so many love this movie this movie be over hyped and the only thing about it that find fabulous be the special effect however this do not make up for the lack of emotional depth in the movie and the drawn out attempt at building suspense compare to the series of book this movie be base on the movie seem shallow and lack cohesiveness and character development be bore and just want the movie to finish which be rare for me less focus on special effect and more attention to good acting and story that build suspense would have make for good movie perhaps little more background into the character live for example would have add lot to the overall presentation
no plot just effect it be long time since ve watch such boring movie there be literally no plot at all the plot be force by some completely random happen stuff the movie be cgi effect only and nothing more 1 crime of grindelwald where be they because haven see one 2 what be the point of the fantastic beast other than pure cgi appearances 3 everything be so dumbed down felt insult while watch it literally 4 no good soundtrack overall 1 10 even this be much
quentin tarantino begin his direct career with the first of several chronologically mixed disturbingly violent and incredibly powerful film the first time saw reservoir dog be about 15 it have be ban in my country and hear it be extremely voilent naturally do everything in my power to get my paw on copy and when finally do see it be disappoint be just sit there say quot wheres all the violence quot anyway watch it till the end and then watch it again and since then it have just grow on me br br this be one of the movie don 39 get bore watching time and time again still watch it at least once year because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time you simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie the one liner be classic quot be you gon na bark all day quot quot 39 ll make you my dog 39 bitch quot mr blonde be totally believable as psycho mean who stop to get fry and soda just after commit robbery the fact that everything be ludicrous but you don 39 know this because these guy and the way they talk be so impossibly cool that you just accept it this movie be all about the dialog the violence be use sparingly and to well effect the way the film be edit be genius its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it and the next time you watch it there 39 a whole scene that you forget be there the storyline be unpredictable and thrill this be well that pulp fiction and in my opinion definitely tarintino 39 best movie didn 39 care much for the quot kill bill quot movie but who care 39 not review them br br if you haven 39 see reservoir dog just rent it buy it or steal it right now
oh so familiar ok the effect be great the action be impressive mean visually the movie be pretty good and ll even say the acting be do well the character be charm the pace be slow at time but not dead bore slow my only problem be how many time be we go to see the exact same story mean this be your typical teen drama new kid shady past weird and want to stay to himself but there always some cute chick who he risk everything for there always bully who hate that he get the attention of the cute chick so they always end up have conflict mean 90 of this movie be your typical high school drama teen movie and the discovering of his power be like the alien version of spiderman mean it the same ole same ole you explore and try to harness your new power beat up bully and jump around where no one can see you until super strong villain pop up you have to fight in the climax mean as far as an overall success the positive thing mention originally great effect charm character impressive action can for the most part salvage the movie but if you re fan of the genre don expect anything new 3 1 2 outta 5 star
nothing short of amaze just saw the early screening for san diego through the top 10 city on facebook who get them and suffice to say be glad be privilege enough to first off this hand down be the best marvel movie ever don say that lightly and in term of superhero movie with maybe the nolan batman series be tie with this thought whedon do an amazing job to bring out all these character in this one movie especially like what be do with hawkeye and black widow just because those two didn really have their individual movie with their back story you can tell when comic book fan writes and directs comic movie because it clearly show in all area of production for this film go into the film honestly think that lot of the cool mutant action scene would be strictly iron man and captain america but whedon do such great job give each mutant their 15 min of fame and by the end of it you seriously feel like wow this guy chick be badass for every mutant will admit be not hulk fan like the inner story for it but be never fan of the film show or comic but hulk role in the movie be so awesome become fan just from it if any of you be whedon fan then you guy girl will love this movie it have his o write all over the humor and story presentation and there be definitely part in the movie where thought wow this seem like firefly and serenity and story aside if you read watch or idolize marvel superheros as kid the action alone will make you cheer just out of sheer nostalgia of imagine the avenger or men all together on the screen kick as in summation don need to say you need to watch this movie because think anybody who be anybody already know they want to see this all this review have do be just reaffirm the hype behind this movie don say this much but job well do marvel and disney for hire writer director who have the audaciousness to keep it honest and true for those most dedicated comic fan who be the backbone of marvel comic be success and in this day and age of superhero movie and movie in general that be very hard to do cheer joss whedon

superior over original in almost everyway 99 of time remake be bad or much bad this time prefer the american remake the original be weird and bizzare movie this fix most mistake firstly it much well edit and present secondly the dialogue be much well thirdly the acting be so much good and all the people now feel like people instead of weirdo in the original fourthly it take so much more time in the room which make it much more intense and interest the original only have few scene in the room but in this one we spend much more time and we understand the protagonist lot well lastly the action scene and thriller apects be much improve it feel high quality the only thing which suck be the end the original have good end but this one try something different and it be terrible
the vidiot review alvin and the chipmunk the squeakquel usually when you place three wild rodent in record studio surround by expensive equipment and press record all you get be the sound of them chew through the microphone cord follow by crackle of electricity and three death rattle however in this furry family film when you put trio of tree dweller in studio you get bunch of high pitch cover song with dave jason lee in hospital after chipmunk related accident the boy alvin simone and theodore justin long matthew gray gubler and jesse mccartney be entrust to his nephew toby zachary levi require to attend high school the chipmunk make big splash on campus when they re ask to save the school music program but before the boy can collect the prize money they must best an all female chipmunk group amy poehler anna faris and christina applegate perfunctory sequel to the 2007 original the squeakquel maintain the same low expectation as its predecessor the story be sorry the song be bore and the star stud vocal cast be superfluous besides the only time you re libel to find chipmunks inside of high school be when the cafeteria be serve mystery meat for lunch red light
movie be good but overrate seriously guy its great action movie but this should not be in the top 250 list the action be great the story line though be not consistent with the comic book be decent the special effect be great as expect the character be believable on and on it be an acceptably average movie worth spending money watch it in theatre in 3d be real treat but no way in hell be it memorable or noteworthy or groundbreaking it certainly do not deserve to be in top 250 list and be rat above 8 because its just an average movie be begin to loose faith in imdb rating system now
der untergang this movie shouldn have be make because it be absolutely impossible to express this part of the history in posterior make picture let us remember that the plot of this film be base on the personal experience of hitler secretary traudl junge the script write by joachim fest historian know as view history from very conservative angle to person like him history consist in the result of the thought and deed of person at power instead of understand history as the sum of what all human be think and do not to forget the effect of what be happen in the nature around us and not less important of what happen by accident the realism of this film be its weak point because it create at the spectator the illusion of be well inform about what really happen to learn more about the psychotic nature of this depraved crew of gangster would recommend to view leni riefenstahl documentary triumph de willens about the reichsparteitag in nuremberg germany from 1935 make on hitler order there you can see the real physiognomy and discover the collective paranoia in which fell most of the people of country which be until then consider as kulturnation
the bad major movie ever make saw this in first run theatre in philadelphia the week it come out this be he only movie ever voluntarily walk out on it be that bad have great hope because of the advanced publicity and the talented people who work on it but nothing work it be so annoying that at time wish the theatre would catch fire so would have an excuse for leave what else can say others enjoy it but this be one picture that stink so much still remember how bad it be after all this time this be be write in 2005 ve see movie with liz taylor that like but she be badly miscast in this picture and her acting be probably her bad job ever
movie fan really not impressed never write review never think film be as bad as they be make out to be by everyone and be big movie fan however this movie be really bad not even mention the gender message they be try to sell the film itself be bore and not even entertain as comic film it be even bad even harley quinn wasn as effective as she be in suicide squad think suicide squad as film and dc comic adaptation be bad but bird of prey make suicide squad now seem like good film bad to worse for the dc universe as for the portrayal of the main villain in this film what joke
a really disappointing let down unfortunately the simpson movie fail in its attempt to translate to the big screen this be both surprising and disappointing as whereas show like south park have more and more pulled in rating by push the boundary of bad taste the simpson even though have include more adult humour as of late have always primarily rely on excellent set piece and fantastic and varied support cast the last of these point illustrate one of the main failing of this movie the cast of support character be give less screen time than in normal simpson episode which make the movie feel like there be something lack the story be also wildly implausible even by the simpson standard and also feels void of any real substance most simpson episodes involve small scale situation which sometimes but not always progress to large scale with the humour revolve around the simpson handling of the situation not give too much away but the progression of event feel rush and with the talent of the writer you feel they could have think of something well unfortunately as with many movie that have personally see lately most of the best bit of the film be in the trailer everyone in the cinema be obviously look forward to the arrival of spider pig but apart from what you see of him in the trailer he be discard very quickly which leave many people confuse the joke be also hit and miss some of them actually make people in the cinema groan this be again disappointment as the simpson be know for laugh out loud moment the movie also rehash at least one story line which have be cover several time in the various season of the simpson this either feel like laziness on the part of the writer or an attempt to include storyline which they know have keep viewer attention for several year and will help as the producer of the movie say to introduce the movie to those people who have not watch the simpson before this be say it still feel that the writer could have think up fresh idea for both fan and newcomer alike as some people who have watch the film will know there be one moment of nudity that while drawn be none the less more shocking than funny and from the reaction in the cinema it be ill advise parent be tutting some child be laugh heartily but some star at the screen not really sure what reaction they should have this moment be in total contrast to event at the beginning of the movie where an itchy and scratchy cartoon have be tone down this make the film feel bit of mess in conclusion the simpson movie suffers from lack of what the show be all about superb support cast simple yet effective comedy and story that while not totally unbelievable doesn leave you scratch your head as to what the hell be go on this movie be the most disappointing film have see in while which be great shame
hype this film have always be in the back of my mind as one of the great one of those must see film that just hadn get around to watch yet so made point of watch it oh dear don get me wrong want to like this film give it the benefit of the doubt consider it age and the hype surround it but it be dreadful in my opinion if lee hadn die tragically during the making if this film then it would probably have go straight to dvd and wouldn have just sit through an hour and half of dross
i forgive you clint the best western ever they say clint eastwoods masterpiece and the last real western ever make they say do they do they really think they be talk through they re cowboy hat good movie sure top notch performance and very well direct but not anything we haven see thousand time before the outlaw josey wale be much good western and mirror the same sentiment of man past catch up with him violent yes but we be lead to believe that they be violent time can not comment on that because wasn there gene hackman be great as the violent sheriff try to keep order in violent time and of course clint make great cowboy but this movie lack little something for me also think that the men portray in this would worry too much about prostitute who have few scar on her face either but that irrelevant at time the music go off and you expect clint eastwood to start sing all in all few hour of good western but don for one second believe it be oscar material think they think mr eastwood deserve one before he die

utterly shambolic have attempt to watch this once before and fail try again due to its nod at the oscar think maybe hadn give it fair chance it really be disappointment end to end bar some of the visuals it be certainly one of the bad marvel film ve see and think it fair to say none of which be oscar worthy in the best picture category other category maybe it a big shame that other genuine brilliant movie would have miss out on their chance of an award due to this if it teach me anything it that the oscar be no longer relevant and should be ignore perhaps also many of the major film review sit as the rating must be artificial hopefully that get expose at some point as it would be questionable ethically if not also false advertising
slightly good than puppy video on youtube don get me wrong this be good film just painfully average watch the entire 2 hour film in about 30 minute on netflix well have the bad habit of fast forward boring movie and tv show what can say predictable plot wait be there plot forgettable cast on man they even get the guy from the walk dead to play that hmm what his name act talent waste it a film you can guess the end right at the begin not sure this would be count as spoiler but here you go the whole film can be sum up in one sentence yes you have guess it korean girl save her pet from evil cooperation this film be beautifully craft love letter to those animal lover and they will no doubtfully praise the film to the high heaven admit it some people rate this film 10 out of 10 just because the animal liberation activist be artificially glorify in the film but really the film barely barely scratch the surface of the meat industry well guess script dare to go deeply down the rabbit hole wouldn be approve by the sponsor but congratulation on sell more okja toy in mcdonalds and kfcs well do

a frustrating film that go nowhere the coen brother have succeed in make what be possibly the most nihilistic film in the history of cinema and in do so they have divide the audience like moses part the red sea lot of people love this film and feel it be one of the great ever make while m on the opposite side think the film be too frustrating to be enjoy the story as you may know revolves around lleweleyn moss josh brolin and upon his discovery of crime scene drug sale go horribly wrong the theft of two million dollar from the moment he steal the money moss be follow by anton chigurh javier bardem menace figure who kill anyone who get in his way along the way we meet sheriff ed thom bell tommy lee jones who really do nothing to advance the story any since his character do little to stop the event which unload on screen in his soliloquy we learn that he have see well time than the horror unravel around him and that this be no country for old men thus the title and that basically the story in nutshell there be virtually no development of character no backdrop to show us why chigurh be involve and so evil and no involvement of bell character there be brief appearance of carson well woody harrelson who be hire to track down moss and chigurh by someone who obviously be behind the whole drug deal yet we know nothing about who hire him even the credit list the character as man who hire well after well fail the man who hire well then involve band of mexican to track down moss and the story go off the rail from there what be even more frustrating be the final quarter of the film where not only do we not get any further development of character we get the lead character kill off camera scene involve chigurh and moss wife that be not fully realize an out of the blue car accident which doesn do anything of any importance and yet another meaningless soliloquy from jones truly do not understand the hype and love surround this film when saw the film several people walk out and there be groan at the end of the movie and multiple apology to love one from people have bring them to see what be to be the movie of the year sure the movie have great cinematography great sound and decent act it a coen brother film would you expect less the problem lie in the script and the lack of character development there be some great scene of tension especially one involve chigurh and gas station owner and the toss of coin scene which truly deserve to be in good movie if you re look for entertainment the best advice here be to stay far away from this film
ungodly long too many error and just plain bad my initial thought after leave the movie theatre for watchman be that have just pay ten dollar to see movie which should have go straight to dvd first it be horribly write script dialogue should do two thing in film reveal character or advance the plot too many time do they have unnecessary scene the fire rescue follow by sex scene and dialogue which have nothing to do with the two point mention the soundtrack of the movie be mostly song from the 60 and 70 even though the movie take place in the the 80 they should have go with han zimmer style of orchestra not the cheesy jimmy hendrix all along the watch tower it just doesn fit in with the movie none of the song do this isn forrest gump it a crime comic book drama if you can even call it that again with the dialogue too many time be they tell you instead of show you visually or through dialogue what they be do or what be happen the director doesn give the audience enough credit take look at the error section for this movie the list be endless more than most any other movie out there win even go into all of those error and how bad they make this film terrible act overall too roarshach look like danny bonduce knock off and that mask he have be ripoff from batman begin when he put it on and be like tell me what you see to the doctor so dumb try to be like the scarecrow and billy crudip the best actor in the movie we don even know he in it because he a blue guy with no emotion zack snyder couldn figure out if he want to make this like comic book movie or real drama action and that really hur the movie there be too many stupid little fight scene that have no point in the end all product of the movie in the end you need more than bunch of explosion and blood spilling to make good film definitely one of the bad film have ever see s the rape scene between the comdeian and that lady so unrealistic it like they have choreograph rape scene mean mon so cheezy also very cliché to have the comedian be the father to the girl saw that come form mile away
an intense emotional drama at its core my father and my son be another old man young kid story do just right while it be not as amazing or as stunning as many review proclaim it be still very good movie it be prone to sentimentality sometimes but that be more of cultural thing while act wasn spot on in couple of place mostly everybody have do very good job and though it may appear that the actor be overact you have to keep in mind that different culture have different norm and different way of express emotion my father and my son be not groundbreaking but it be both touch and humorous without fall in too many clichés very good movie and treat for foreign movie lover
idiotic slickness well title the gps make me do it this movie start off reasonably slick and cool but after the action start we realize this dumb monotone woman voice be simply direct our character around an unrealistic set of pre plan event and you realize you be simply watch someone idea of one of those speak car speaking device go crazy and instead of tell you to turn left go ten mile it say jump now you have 30 second and door open and someone start shoot at you after the 3rd incidence of this you realize you be watch an unintentional comedy about car voice terrorist plot couple of people be frame as terrorist and then chase everywhere unrealistically by the fbi counterterrorism unit all the while they be continually get message through any electronic device from car gps voice from hell that be terrorist once you realize what the plot vehicle be you might not be able to stop laughing as you think about sit in talk car and have it give you dumb direction like be in this movie
gee wonder if matrix 5 be in the work understand this be graphic novel and no have not read it but if the movie be remotely base on it just don see who think it could translate well to film there be not single original idea in this film and to top it all off you blow stuff up to the 1812 overture come on throw in cg motion trail on knife and love admission eerily reminiscent of the original matrix and this thing just overload on cheese the theme of good and evil the symbolism be so over explain and illustrate in this movie that it almost insult combine that with ridiculous and overly simplistic plot and you get not only numb backside but numb head as well from the first moment of alliteration abuse to the final tone of the 1812 overture this movie be simply dull and fail to entertain if you want to make movie fill with anti government and medium propaganda next time stick to pamphlet in my opinion
astonishingly bad insult to viewer intelligence critic and audience alike should be ashamed for heap praise on the maker of this movie not only be it overrate it be flat out bad clint and his screenwriter paul haggis botch both half of this manipulative story the first half show no respect or even knowledge of the sport of box the gym scene and training scene be cursory at best and make rocky look like the pinnacle of realism also no amount of natural box talent allow 130 pound fighter to pull of early round knockouts every time out it do not happen in men or woman box but let just say we can write off the boxing element as hollywood shorthand the characterization and dramatic thrust of the film be equally stilted and unbalance this film should be more complex emotionally than it be the main character be make to look way too righteous and everyone else be unfeeling scum even the priest how ridiculous be the white trash family caricature why do swank have to fall at the hand of sucker punch by monstrous cheater of an opponent do we really need to see morgan freeman knock out danger taunter of course we do because that the kind of filmmaker clint eastwood be he believe in stacked deck and simplistic portrayal of good v evil go out and rent the gauntlet pale rider blood work sudden impact and other eastwood film for more example of his boneheaded approach to humanity mystic river manages to escape ridiculous simplicity thanks in large part to the very talented screenwriter brian helgeland that kind of attitude can be fun like in the dirty harry film but in mdb it add up to cheap unearned pathos that be practically beg to be recognize by the academy as something important it not important or even move it laughable it like hard sell for tear anyone with any sense ain buying it
have great potential this movie be one of the countless that have come out of hollywood that have great potential however like so many personality in hollywood it sell it soul for cheap finish there be some beautiful idea in this movie and it could of be great however the producer choose to go for the cheap thriller effect instead of explore what truly make us human or machine conceive write and produce by idiot with now soul don waste your time the only redeem part of this movie be when the dweeb get send to the stick and be surprise when his smartphone tell him that there be no signal the producer and writer of this piece of crap obviously have no signal also
an empty plot and nonexistent character development make this reboot of marvel iconic superhero quartet pointless exercise in ignominy just because you can do it doesn mean that you should and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of marvel most famous superteam be proof of that axiom say what you may about tim story earlier cinematic adaptation but as generic and middle as they be they be at the very least entertain unfortunately the same can not even be say of josh trank back to basic origin story which play like humourless retread of his debut film chronicle but on big budget and l there be any doubt it be far far from fantastic not that it doesn demonstrate such promise the first act which establish the friendship between the visionary reed richards mile teller and his tough guy longtime best pal ben grimm jamie bell as well as the team dynamic between reed and the other member of his research team the equally brilliant sue kate mara her hot head young brother johnny michael jordan and malcontent genius victor von doom toby kibbell capably lay the foundation for what could have be character drive drama base on their clashing personality indeed after the boy sans sue decide on whim follow night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test how they respond to their newfound super power individually and as team should be an organic evolution from how they be before ala trank who co write the screenplay with men veteran simon kinberg and jeremy slater doesn quite know where to go from there rather than set them on course that would follow the perennial men theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society our teenage super hero be pretty much see only in an isolated military facility where they be train and from which they be deploy on covert operation overseas while johnny relish the opportunity to be different powerful and useful for once in his life sue and ben be not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remain possibility that the government research on them would yield some way of reverse their abnormality in the meantime reed have vanish off the grid while victor be presume dead on the planet they have land up on in the other dimension one sense conscious decision on the part of trank to eschew the usual superheroics see in the recent profusion of marvel and to lesser extent dc comic book adaptation but the middle act drag precisely because trank never quite find compelling substitute johnny potential conflict with sue and ben over the government exploitation of their super power never amount to anything more than playground squabble the estrangement between johnny and his father reg cathey whose baxter institute have overseen the ill fat project be under cook and last but not least reed guilt over his teammate fate as well as his strained friendship with ben seem to vanish as quickly as he be apprehend and bring back to the facility to aid them in version 2 0 of the same project trank intention of emphasise the tension within the quartet be evident and admirable but be ultimately undone by script that doesn develop it in any substantive manner bad still it leave an audience look for visual spectacle severely want that not even very busy third act manage to salvage doom make an unsurprising return here as their common enemy drive by fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet earth become rally call for the team to unite despite their difference it be one of the dull and most unexciting finale we ve see in marvel movie not least for the fact that it doesn know how to collectively bring together their superpower except in tag team fashion to distract their opponent it be also on the whole one of the ugly comic book movie we ve ever see the planet from which the quartet gain their power be barren rocky wasteland that have no character or distinction whatsoever shroud perpetually with thick grey cloud and give the even more nondescript name of zero the energy that give them their ability appear as some slimy green goo that belong entirely in c grade syfy tv movie while their power whether reed rubber limb or sue telekinesis or johnny pyrotechnic or ben rock cover body look equally cheesy it be no wonder too that the eventual showdown which take place almost entirely on the planet surface of zero doesn play out any much well against such bland set come off even bad than any of the action scene in its predecessor and certainly this reboot be in no way good than tim story earlier adaptation no matter of its ambition of be darker and more character drive superhero piece chronicle may have be perfect call card for trank but fantastic four show young inexperienced director completely out of his depth absolutely justify the advance bad buzz it have spend month battle it be utterly embarrass that film about marvel most enduring creation be no good than live action power ranger movie but that exactly the ignominy that this misconceive and badly execute excuse of superhero movie have work as be typical with such origin story this one end with the quartet stumble on their title as they admire their new home in central city and reflect on how far they have come ben aka the thing describe their journey as fantastic we re not entirely sure anyone of their audience share the same sentiment
a wonderful sci fi movie like it lot it be really sci fi and well do it be confuse at time but it make sense in the end if you like sci fi and or jennifer garner you should watch this movie the special effect be cool and it will have you quote the movie for day it a sort of calm and quiet movie when it not an action scene the action scene be really awesome and contain some cool move that will make you want to rewind and play rewind and play and then try yourself which you shouldn jennifer acting be really well do along with her co star and you ll find yourself understand the character from daredevil more you should only watch this movie if you be fan of science fiction if you love jennifer garner but hate science fiction you might not want to watch elektra but this movie isn quite like others there a different in good way feel to it if you watch the movie hope you enjoy it
heath ledger dark and brilliant swan song couldn believe the dark knight could live up to the hype that perhaps the big surprise the secret believe be stunning mature intelligent script that make it the best superhero movie ever make as if that wasn enough heath ledger he the new of the tragic modern icon present us with preview of something we ll never see fearless extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villain his performance be master class fortunately christian bale batman be almost supporting character bale be good but there be something around his mouth that stop him from be great the dark knight be visually stunning powerful and move what else could anyone want
painfully and shamefully average have wait year since its original release before finally saw it mean that could watch it without the typical oscar hype that surround it and frankly just don get what the hype be all about the story be somewhat muddled tale of struggle actress and jazz musician who fall in love though they struggle to keep thing together as they chase their dream now plain story like this can usually be dress up in musical with flashy singing and dance neither of which be present here the song be repetitive as it turn out that listen to the exact same chord progression repeat for two hour can become bit tedious and stone and gosling singing in the shower warble certainly didn dazzle this viewer in fact their restrained musical performance be an embarrassment to the resplendent costume and set that surround them what bad however be that its potential do shine through there be two or three dramatic scene between stone and gosling that be so well write and brilliantly act they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest it not bad film by any standard just very painfully and shamefully average finally watch enough strictly come dancing to be irk by the poor shaping of emma stone hand during her final musical number with ryan gosling but that be quite picky isn it
diamond in the rough so many movie out there be pure drivel they use sex or shock or sex to sell two hour of something that in no way contribute to our existence be it inspiration knowledge or spiritual awakening contact be an exceptional example of movie that deserve to exist from the spectactular beginning shot that show us just how small we be in world that once think the universe be make for and around mankind to its realistic conclusion that any phile would expect to happen this movie appeal to our humanity intelligence and sense of adventure one of the great realisation that the movie will guide you to be that what we search for in out space be actually in our own backyard we be cut off from each other and sci fi try to quell our loneliness with idea that we ll meet t and wont feel so lonely in our existence but be aren alone we have each other never get tire of watch this movie though wish they bring out packed special edition dvd full of behind the scene effect and the like
nice extravagant movie but very brutal nice movie sometimes bit long and you have to like the unrealistic overdramatic superhero genre and it be very brutal with very explicit story and scene of violence thing personally do not prefer
